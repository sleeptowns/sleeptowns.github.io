 <div class=question>hello shaa !!! nothing much to say here. i originally had so many words planned to say while opening up your curiouscat: only to be hit with its going to be discontinued ?? in a week ?? oh god. now, all i want to tell you is that all of your answers have been a huge comfort me over the past couple of years. i fear that i may not love them as much as i do fear losing them, but few have stuck with me and the fact that they will just. not exist in original form. just wow.... your snippet about shoushimin kinda gets me here ... like these questions and these answers are all just a means of bridging one to yourself and back and forth and back. anyway, ive gone on too long !!! time to scroll and try to find some of the ones i think about a lot. you had an ask about lapsed christianity, and sha i swear it changed me</div>

 <div class=reply>i check cc on the app and had no idea until you sent this in, so thank you for singlehandedly and inadvertently giving me the heads-up :( <br><br>it’s a weirdly sentimental thing for me, too! i’ve spent so much time thinking about these answers, even and especially when they stumped me, that it truly feels like a loss of something to have that come to a close — even though logically i know i’m just a random incoherent person fumbling through replies to anonymous askers who deserve better. but it was a means of bridging one to oneself for me as well. so. thank you for saying that. <br><br>it’s amazing that despite the anonymous nature of the site i rarely received anything that made me want to abandon it for good, and instead got all these chances to reflect on and hear about things i never would have otherwise. the fact that i received so many questions that moved me and urged me to find words for what i would have left unarticulated otherwise, messages that exposed me to people’s kindness about my writing and my thoughts — it’s something precious, and so it really feels like i’m losing something irreplaceably valuable here, even as i share your thoughts about lamenting losing their original form more than loving my own answers. i know i can be rambly and at times unempathetic in these replies, but i also understand that even if i can migrate somewhere else (and i know i’ll do my best to foster another corner of the internet like this), four years’ worth of messages from a small village of strangers deserves to be grieved in its erasure all the same. <br><br>anyway! thank you once again for the heads-up, and for dropping by here and there over the years. an end to an era, in some ways, and as silly as that might be to say about a literal broken website of a q&amp;a tool 😭 it was a good run, and i feel endlessly blessed to have had thoughtful and kind people like you on the other end. it’s a comfort to know at least two sentences every few answers could have left an impression. thank you for your time and attention and trust, and for the me you made possible in these messages.</div>

 <div class=reply>star rail? very much so omg that’s like. the one thing you don’t have to doubt about me right now. i’ve started asking for permission to talk to people about it bc i can palpably sense it’s all that ever comes out of my mouth and i’d hate to be the equivalent of a person whose entire personality trait is their significant other. my phone finally broke down last month and there was no divine power that could hold me back from finding a way to log in regardless. we’re in a trauma-bonded relationship, hsr and i.<br><br>idk if you wanted my thoughts on anything in particular — please don’t hesitate to let me know if so! not sure at the moment how with cc closing but i’m ready to yap at any given moment about anything hsr! — but. yeah. i’m chilling. nothing here for me to complain about aside from the usual hoyo-wide bullshit (that you can argue hsr players are shielded from just a tiny, tiny bit more than the sibling games). loved the last arc, wrote mini-essays about it to anyone who let me rant, am maybe even a bit petty bc i’ve seen some people be like “yo the luofu writing is pretty good this time around” and i’m that astronaut meme going “always has been 🔫” ruan mei got one (1) line and one (1) potentially immoral activity, jing yuan was jing yuan-ing, i’m knee-deep in the muck that is sunday leaks. life might suck, but hsr is never the reason. <br><br>it always treats me as best as it can, all things considered. if not for it, i probably would have gotten a flip phone as a replacement for the one that broke. but alas. i’m here. i’ll keep being here for a while, very likely. i was already caged from the moment they gave me the high cloud quintet and now we’re about to head into a greco-roman world. they never want to let me leave. one of these days i’m gonna have a manic episode and believe in the heat of psychosis that i imagined hsr bc there’s no way a game i didn’t make up inside my own mind is this tailor-made for all my interests. at this point hsr is my percy jackson lotus hotel. <br><br>unless you mean honkai as in hi3 then this is rather embarrassing of me 😭 i do not play hi3 anymore, unfortunately… but i am watching… looking at other people play… liking edits… etc etc</div>

 <div class=question>Dear Sha, I hope you are well.<br>I listened to "I would" by Strawberry Boy before I realized it was on the flls’s playlist.<br> I can't tell you how I felt. It's like this song is embroidered with their names. So I want to ask you, if you don't mind at all, when you put it on the playlist, what was going through your mind at the time? How did it remind you of them? And How do you visualise the scene that describes them through this song?<br> I would really love to know. Thank you !</div>

 <div class=reply>i saw your follow-up message and no worries, i did think you meant “what would i do” by strawberry guy! it’s likely in the playlist bc it was a recommendation, though if i had a dollar for every time someone has recommended this artist in relation to flls, i’d have a lot of coffee money; it’s like we can all feel that the vibes here are very mid to late stage flls, and that’s very special to see. <br><br>as for why i placed it where i did in the playlist, i just think it captures the melancholy and wistfulness of maturing in your love for someone. your first love teaches you how love Can end, and maybe that’s what sticks with a lot of people and why first love must seem unforgettable or unending. but flls is kind of specific in the sense that they couldn’t renew their relationship until the first love part of it has ended. it doesn’t mean they stopped loving each other with as much intensity as they used to, just that sometimes a train has to leave before another can pull in. and that’s what this song felt like to me. i kinda see two yuujis and megumis on opposite platforms at a train station. one side has their younger selves, the other has their older selves. the split second they see the other pair for who they are is the moment of truth: looking at older itfs, younger itfs understand that in order to become happy in the future, they have to end it; older itfs know, looking at their younger selves, that they loved each other back then, but it wasn’t a love with a future. and i think there’s that blink where they see each other just before the train rushes in, and once it leaves, the platforms are empty.<br><br>this is making No goddamn sense omg my point is that this song is wrapped up in so many feelings that feel emblematic of flls—melancholy, hope, love, the difficulty and ease of that love, the understanding that the right choice is to say goodbye and to trust yourself when the time comes to know that this is it, this is the right time, and you’re here now, and here the love can flourish. this time, as the lyrics say, they can ask the other to stay. <br><br>you might have been looking for one specific scene in the story that corresponds to this song, and if there’s one, it’s the scene at megumi’s apartment in ch7. when they’re finally talking about everything. we don’t get megumi’s pov that chapter, but i can only hope we can all feel that a part of him in that moment is how this song sounds: realizing that he can’t let yuuji go a second time, letting himself be vulnerable in accepting that this is it, he’s about to cross to the other side of that first love that ended horribly and he’s not crossing without yuuji. <br><br>my gosh. i hope this makes Some level of sense. thank you for dropping by with a question, and i also hope you are well!</div>

 <div class=question>Hello dear sha &lt;3<br>Hope you’re doing well! <br>I'd love to hear your thoughts on Arabic poems and poets! There are so many amazing ones out there.

 <div class=reply>oh, it is rather bittersweet to see this upon finding out that cc is closing down, but all the same, if there’s any way for you at all to (and only if you’d like), i’d still love to hear more about arabic poems and poets! it’s such a specific and irreplaceable joy when when people translate poetry and songs for me, especially from languages i’m not able to navigate on my own.<br><br>my mental poetry repertoire isn’t super big or varied in the first place, and i’m not proud to say it gets even smaller when i have to think off the cuff like this. the first poets to come to mind include mahmoud darwish, of course, but other poets i’ve also really enjoyed (in translation) are samih al-qasim (my first one from him was “shalom,” and it has stuck to my mind since and even more in the past year), nizar qabbani (i’m very picky about love poetry, but he and nikki giovanni just seem to always get the simplicity required to convey enormity, if that makes sense), ahmad almallah (i discovered “the sky keeps surprises” through poetry foundation and the use of the words bleeding-threading-leaking in it stunned me), and i also like iman mersal, najwan darwish and ines abassi, all of whom i discovered through words without borders. <br><br>so. as you can see. it is not very committed, and that’s something i gotta remedy. i’d love to read way more, especially ones that might not be available in wider translation :(</div>

 <div class=question>Hope you're having a good day, Sha! How have you been lately?<br><br>I miss your flls’s Megumi and Yuji so much that sometimes I wonder - I hope this doesn't sound ridiculous - ah... what are they doing now? Are they okay, happy, smiling and everything? <br><br>It's just that, you know, their world has overlapped with mine so much that I really think they're in their apartment in Funabashi now, so I'd like to ask you, if you don't mind, to go along with my silly mind - if their world is real, what do you think they're doing now?<br><br>And if you’re really okay with this, what songs do they send each other? What are the songs that Yuji sends to Megumi captioning "This reminds me of you" or that Megumi feels the urge to send to Yuji the moment he hears it "Listen to this, it's about you"?<br><br>I hope this isn't too long and bothersome, I really have a soft spot for this world you've given us. Thank you so much, Sha. We love you so much.</div>

 <div class=reply>stop oh my goodness this isn’t long or bothersome at all !! if anything i feel terribly guilty at how much i’ve had to become hands-off with fics and really appreciate when people ask me direct questions like this as a reflective middle ground 🫂<br><br>in my mind, i see the boys okay and happy. they’re probably stable in their respective careers rn, though it’s still too early to tell if they’ll both continue with basketball and clinic work. i see yuuji choosing to become a coach earlier than people expect him to, just bc he finds more joy in that, while megumi sticks to the usual path of intern to assistant to full-timer and is currently wondering if he wants to be a vet specialist. <br><br>i imagine that after living together for a while, they’ve decided to look for a bigger, more permanent place of their own (return of yuuji’s ch7 agent?) and have just moved in 🤔 but that reminds me—i saw someone’s video the other day, where she had to babysit her nephew and put him to sleep in an empty walk-in closet bc no other spot in the house was baby-sleep-proofed. i was like omg that’s megumi the first time he &amp; yuuji had to babysit tsumiki’s first kid. i answered a cc a long time ago about them as uncles, but i think there’s a lot of fun to spin out of megumi &amp; yuuji when the kid’s still an actual baby. i see it so clearly: megumi clutching his hair with his eyebrows furrowed as he scrolls through someone’s advice on dangers to watch out for, and yuuji cleaning out their closet in record speed even though they Just finished unpacking everything from the move. they’re fine otherwise! regular adult worries, etc. there’s a point where things even out and you Know this is it, this is your forever with someone, and i think these are the years where itfs move from hope/imagination to tangible reality.<br><br>and haha i’ve always imagined megumi sending songs that remind him of yuuji in a half-teasing way. older songs, mostly, like the final radio song rec in ch7. songs like “young, alive, in love” by flipper’s guitar, “love in the first degree” by wink, “don’t worry baby” by the beach boys, the entirety of angel touch by cindy, which is probably the background ost that plays like hold music in megumi’s head when yuuji’s around. megumi also likely doesn’t consider the lyrics too much to think it’s About yuuji, but if yuuji had just dissected some of these song choices pre-dating… well. he certainly does now that they’ve been dating a while. possibly more than megumi even realizes why he even associates certain songs with yuuji. as if megumi needed any more triggers to tunnel vision on yuuji from mundane triggers 😭<br><br>i am all out of space but thank you thank you thank you for caring about these boys, seriously. they’re okay! that’s one thing you never have to doubt about yuuji and megumi in any universe, i think. if it was up to them and the choices they make with the other in mind, they’ll always be just fine.</div>

 <div class=reply>the last related answer was long enough ago that i can’t scroll that far back without the embarrassment of rereading my own words, so please bear with me as i bumble through this already unforgivably late reply ☹️<br><br>hmm i feel like we often expect the progression of one life chapter to culminate by default in the start of what comes next, as if life unfolds in a series of epiphanies like a relay race where the proverbial baton is gaining clarity on something that will let us leave this in-between state asap. but i think clarity is an abstract idea that’s only desirable when it’s a concept; it’s also unreliable and temporary. you never know what could change, tomorrow or next year. there isn’t really one way to get the one true right choice, and even if there was, there’s no guarantee it will lead you straight to the good ending you want, nor that it will Always remain the right choice. career and culture trends change, as do you as a person. all we can do is make sure we equip ourselves with enough that we stand strong in the face of all the choices we’ll have to make in life. so, above all, i don’t think you’re ever under any obligation or urgency to have The Rest Of Your Life nailed down.<br><br>it’s mapmaking from scratch, is all. if you don’t know where you are and all you have is an empty piece of paper, then start from nothing. the more of the empty space you do try to chart, the more familiar the terrain naturally becomes. follow your gut, and if your gut is silent, pick a direction at random—seriously. take classes or jobs for the money, or simply for the vibes. you don’t have to feel 100% about something to give it a shot. there’s already an infinite amount of numbers between 0 and 1, and 0.01% is plenty. i think the more you attempt, even if it amounts to seemingly nothing, the more you internalize and cement about yourself and the world. yes, the growing pains of constant new beginnings are difficult, but change will come and the time will pass regardless.<br><br>this might sound like a platitude that doesn’t need saying, but truly, it’s no failure on your part to not have more figured out than you think you should. how could you, when current you doesn’t even have access to all the variables that future you might? you’re where you’re at right now bc of the living you’ve already done, and that will be true for future you, too. you’ll make it true. <br><br>i can Feel how opaque &amp; unhelpful this is, god, but maybe all i mean is susan sontag saying, “do stuff. be clenched, curious. not waiting for inspiration’s shove or society’s kiss on your forehead. pay attention. it’s all about paying attention. attention is vitality. it connects you with others. it makes you eager. stay eager.” <br><br>i believe you did the right thing listening to what you no longer wanted, and i pray there will be more for you to listen to come what may !! i’m sending you endless well wishes &amp; the same abundance of love twofold 🫂🤍</div>

 <div class=question>How do you feel about Hanif Abdurraqib using Woolf’s suicide letter as a blackout poem?</div>

 <div class=reply>interesting question! i think it does what it set out to do, and the real poetry lies not in the words that resulted from the blackout format itself but rather the relationship between the two poems. i don’t know how comfortable i am with evaluating someone’s suicide letter as a “work” to begin with, but this is a funky grey area as it is—plenty of writers are buoyed by the legacy of their own suicide, and there is a point where the line is blurred on purpose bc the very act of writing is already a matter of objectifying a thought or experience. it’s an object by the time it is a word, a sentence, and from some angles, all abdurraqib has done is repurpose a complete image of a piece of art and produce his own object. the bell jar has experienced a similar trajectory, as with many writers whose lives become commodified in attachment to the commodification of their writing, especially after a sensationalized death.<br><br>this is. a very crass way of looking at someone’s suicide letter. it’s not necessarily a belief i subscribe to. but it’s true that worse has been glorified in popular art, at times for the very purpose of targeting the inevitable dichotomy and/or shock factor. andy warhol’s death and disaster series comes to mind, just as a tangential example. that doesn’t excuse or justify it, and i personally find it a touch distasteful no matter what, but again, i see where the logic was, and the strength is def more in the space between the two works + abdurraqib’s own identity markers as a poet in the 21st century amidst the current sociopolitical climate held up against the light of woolf’s own background at the time of writing. as far as intentions go, there’s something there that is clearly not just wanting to romanticize or subvert a suicide letter. so. i can’t say it moves me on the personal Or thematic level, but it’s mostly bc it’s not abdurraqib at his best. he’s explored and created far more nuanced forms of art, and it feels like witnessing a haphazardly realized idea to see what he’s done here. i think.</div>

 <div class=reply>ruanliu and (though a bit more recent and a smidge less intense for now) sunren 😓<br><br>i probably owe a lot to all the artists who fuel my hunger despite them. you know. having never interacted in-game (yet! but you gotta invest early. just in case.) i find both dynamics infinitely interesting ahhhh something about jingliu &amp; blade being these powerful immortal legends burdened by the very embodiment of Your Greatest Enemy Is Yourself, whereas ruan mei &amp; sunday share the common thread of yearning towards apotheosis as a means of absolving themselves of the “weaknesses” and/or vulnerabilities of being ultimately mortal and of-this-world.<br><br>the best description i’ve read of ruan mei is that she’s an addict looking for her next high, even as the part of her that can be stimulated by the same wonder she felt as a child has long been dulled by the ease of her own brilliance and at the same time complicated by how she never fully processed her grief. she still sees mortality as a betrayal, and a matter of someone’s personal failure. that finds a fractured image in jingliu’s grief finding no closure, bc she’s denied a) the proper rites to bury baiheng without her memory being tainted by what happened, and b) any real revenge, when she lost a core part of herself a second time by torturing blade for what he and dan feng did. and just—the potential of ruan mei’s abilities to concoct life vs. life &amp; death always being this open-ended thing for jingliu, plus the fact that there’s hardly anyone in the game that jingliu would ever be weak or vulnerable around, maybe not even an aeon, but even she wouldn’t be able to escape ruan mei’s clinical fascination with the fragility of the human mind and heart, and especially not when ruan mei is fully capable of resurrection and/or mara management if she so wishes. <br><br>as for sunren… i’m a stellaron hunter sunday conspiracy theorist until someone ties me down and makes me confront whatever truth is out there, and this pair-up stood out to me immediately bc i must leave room in my heart for a dynamic between someone trapped in their devotion and someone trapped in their godhood. the “heaven for all” advocate with ultimately selfish means and the guy who demands “hell for me” for ultimately selfless ends, even. i think sunday has more to confront about the fact that even benevolence can be cruel, while blade is trapped in this body defined by how merciless “kindness” can be—as well as exemplifies how what appears violent can be gentle and kind. i’d also love for blade to interact with someone who grew up believing in redemption &amp; salvation, who still sees a future worth saving in him when he’s in this cycle of forever atoning for his past. and the idea of sunday often using his powers to subjugate—and what a subversion it would be for it to be used for once to calm blade’s mara—doesn’t hurt.<br><br>but who knows. maybe i just like pairing up my fav characters with hcq members.</div>

 <div class=reply>ouran high school host club 🫢 https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1350352647 <br><br>no but probably terrace house’s boys &amp; girls in the city season, but specifically the episodes where hansan is in the house. somewhere around eps 25 to 32? it gets rather uncomfortable with riko &amp; hayato after that, but otherwise, i think that part is the terrace house section that feels the most lived-in to me. not just bc of the drama going on, but bc the housemates at that point feel like they’ve been living together for longer than they actually did. i like the rapport between the more one on one dynamics onscreen, even the messy ones, and hansan is possibly my fav terrace house resident of all time (though seina is a close contender, for crucial honorary reasons).<br><br>there’s also one specific scene in ep. 24 of terrace house’s opening new doors season where two housemates, noah &amp; yui, go on a date to a conjac park, and something about it is so comforting to me despite the fact that everything goes to absolute shit that episode And season. i think that’s worsened even more by how there’s something off in the way the panel talks about the housemates in this particular roster. terrace house had a certain darkness to it even before it was revealed that they were scripting (and evil editing) far more than they admit to And leaving the housemates vulnerable to harassment online at extreme levels, but opening new doors is really just. the season where the toxicity is almost miasmic, both from the hosts and the housemates. i much prefer the dormant discomfort undercutting the overcurated idyll of boys &amp; girls in the city. <br><br>i also talked about the chef show a little bit before https://x.com/sleeptowns/status/1645540583350337539?s=46, though i wouldn’t classify it as pleasure per se. i Still haven’t seen the movie that it spawned out of; i think i’ve watched every episode at least three times and still can’t fully tell you why. i guess i like that it feels as if we’re dropping in on days that would remain unchanged by our presence and absence, and that jon favreau is so open about asking questions? it’s refreshing to see a directionless cooking series led by someone eager about trying and failing and finessing things he’s never attempted before. a lot of the episodes do feel like him trying to flex his hollywood business, which i don’t care for nor about, but some episodes like guerilla tacos, hog island &amp; milk bar bake sale scratch an itch i otherwise can’t locate. it’s just an easy pick to put on when i can’t decide what else to watch at the moment.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello! seems like everyone is back in their hq phase after the movie… i really should watch it and join the collective drowning, but i… fear that not only is this answer very late, it’s also not. useful. like at all. i don’t think i have any Fav fav hq fics, let alone ones from a time after inarizaki was introduced. i’m very sorry to disappoint—i know there are a lot of amazing hq writers out there, even and especially from back in the day; it’s more a wonder that i am mutuals with hq authors whose other writing i love yet somehow impossibly did not meet them through hq 🤔<br><br>ao3 is down right now so i can’t even access my bookmarks, but a fic that has left a solid mark in my mind from the years i read within the tag is “close to the chest” by darkmagicalgirl (i believe)... it’s a kyoutani/yahaba fic with an iwaoi sideplot, though it’s really more a canon compliant imagining of yahaba’s path out of the closet. i think i found my way to it bc i saw kittebasu’s bookmark, but the reason i remember it exceedingly well (aside from personal experiences with the hq sphere circa 2014-2016) is that there’s a scene that kinda unfolds like—<br><br>yahaba: is there anything i can do for you?<br>oikawa: buy me milk bread.<br>yahaba: i meant, like, emotionally<br>oikawa: buy me milk bread, emotionally<br><br>—and that final line has been my bio on LINE for friends since uni. so. i also just think it opened my teenage eyes to the way fics can kind of slot itself against a ready-made spot in the canon narrative, even for characters/dynamics that only got one scene. i’ve carried that with me. i also like several of tothemoon’s fics for subtle but delicious magical realism, and the one that has left a gentle imprint in my mind is one called “this eve of parting.” — i believe, again, and cannot fact check bc ao3 is down :( — but consider this my blanket hug for majority of tothemoon’s hq fics. <br><br>i should have picked a better time to answer this question, but my ao3 bookmarks are so disorganized (and from a time After my hq writing pseud) that i don’t know which ones i have saved, if any. i should do better exactly for situations like this ahhhh i know even less about the current state of the hq tag than my younger self could have ever fathomed… and i apologize for being so scatterbrained about this reply 😭 i’m sure i should have more than this usually, but if You have any recs, i’m not at all opposed to reading for hq again and getting it together.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have! it was really fun? not as emotionally complex as s1, but i anticipated as much and didn’t really mind it to the same degree i might have for another work with a less defined earlier season. i guess i hesitated to watch it for a long time bc i felt like link click just didn’t need another season? there was nothing i could see that would have justified one, at least in a way that would have been sustainable if you wanted to go for even more seasons after that. we had cliffhangers and the overarching plot line, but those were always the weakest part of the show to me—or at least the least compelling. link click at its “weakest” is still a strong idea, but i guess that’s the thing. another season could have only proven the weaker of two next to what i think is a fairly perfect s1. if you know what i mean. <br><br>it’s a shame that i wasn’t proved wrong, and what little s2 did give us about the things i was invested in from the first season were barely enough to ground the story in a foundation steady enough to hold its own once you cut away the higher production value and different overarching tone for this season. i appreciated the “darker” spin and technically more in-depth sci-fi—i just didn’t care for any of it as much as our main cast from the first season. by the time we did get snatches of them and developments in lu guang and cheng xiaoshi’s arcs, both as individuals and with each other, all it seemed to do was shock me back into thinking—oh right. this is still link click. right, right.<br> <br>i know… it sounds like… i didn’t like it. but i swear i did. it always comes from a place of affection, when i talk about link click. it’s just that… s1 was like watching yuzuru hanyu gracefully do a triple axel on carpet, that sense that you’re watching someone who’s confident enough in their control over bodily physics that they won’t stumble. s2 was more like. watching a short distance sprinter have to do a 400m lap and losing steam at some points bc their stamina just isn’t wired towards that. they’re Still an amazing runner, and their form a reminder that being a track athlete takes a lot of endurance and practice, but by the end of an event they don’t usually run in, they’re propelled forward only by their own momentum, and finishes with a lot less grace than people who do 400m on the regular. <br><br>am i making sense help i had a great time! as with s1, i was on the edge of my seat for so much of it! my heart ached! the lu guang reveal had me stressed! and the fight choreo was stunningly impeccable!</div>

 <div class=question>i write to you from time to time and i remember the first time i saw you related to adam i was just like 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️ i can’t pretend to perceive you enough to be like oh they’re so much like adam or anything but i love your writing so much and i’ve always loved adam. i read the raven cycle probably 7 years ago and am honestly like embarrassed by how much i still relate to him. i’ll see a quote about him and just stop wherever i am and have to feel things or every time my pride gets in the way of my life i’ll think of him… i honestly struggle to communicate just how much of my life he still occupies. anyways, i’ve been debating getting an adam tattoo so i went 😮😮😮 when you said you have one!! can i ask what it is?? i only have one tattoo, a two headed calf, and i didn’t get it because of this but the quote about gansey and ronan being a two headed creature definitely popped into my mind when i was debating whether or not to get it and it spurred me on.</div>

 <div class=reply>you sent this a day after after adam’s birthday, which is amazing but also extra insidious on my part with how long it has taken me to get to it... please know that i am going 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️ right back<br><br>i always struggle to decide on tattoos inspired by specific things bc i’d rather people think they’re flashes i chose for generic aesthetics and no real meaning — but i have a sticker sleeve all over my right forearm, and the one closest to my wrist bone is a three-leaf stem in fine line for adam. it’s where i had the worst cuts and bruises throughout my childhood, so there is some typical sentimentalizing there, you know how it goes, but honestly i think my reasoning at the time was mostly some spite about how annoying it was in elementary &amp; high school to hide my injuries in those spots since my uniform sleeves cut off right about there. now sometimes the little leaves peek out through my sleeve and all i think about is adam and both of us sticking it out until we were free. <br><br>anyway! i hope that’s not. like. tmi. god. my only point is that the tattoo itself is quite lowkey and not overtly adam-y, and what makes me call it my adam tattoo is more a series of jumps in logic. so i understand what you mean with the line about gansey &amp; ronan popping into your mind even with a tattoo that seemingly has nothing to do with them! i mean. some things can’t be decontextualized. i can’t imagine that being a bad thing when it comes to ink permanently etched on you. plenty of things in life you can’t choose to carry the permanent stain of, nor can you choose how to define your association to it. plenty of people in history haven’t gotten to choose what’s branded on them. it shouldn’t be seen as less than the privilege it is that we get to choose And define how we relate to something visible on us. even if it’s a silly, tangential justification. <br><br>on that note, there was also this artist who allowed their ley line art to be tattooed (https://tinyufoboss.tumblr.com/post/142324856194/ley-lines) and for years and years i thought i’d get the adam one… but i did end up settling for the one i have now, and i feel like it’s more me. all to say i feel what you feel about adam. thank you for sharing in that with me (and if you ever do end up getting a tattoo in his honour, i’d love to hear what you decided on. only if you’d be comfortable sharing, that is!)</div>

 <div class=question>sha!! do you have any advice for writers block? i promised myself i would write more this year, but it's july and i have absolutely nothing. i haven't written anything outside of the writing class i took a few semesters ago :( sometimes i can't tell if i actually have writers block or i'm just downright lazy. there are so many days where i'll sit in front of my computer and wait for my fingers to magically conjure up something good, but it all has the same outcome — i end up writing absolutely nothing. as a stranger on the internet who is desperate for guidance and advice, i would appreciate any bit of it. <br><br>also, your fics are amazing and i totally admire you as a writer, even though i don't know you. i really really hope i can write like you one day! i can't wait to see more stuff from you!</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m really really sorry for how long it took me to answer ahhhhh i hope it’s okay if i start by pointing to an earlier reply — i find it’s just about the only answer i can give in these situations: https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1326521137 <br><br>mostly, i think... there’s always a reason we can’t write, &amp; it’s often more mundane than we want it to be. for me, the biggest troublemakers are distraction, or the words coming but feeling painful and more rigid than normal. it helps me to be in total solitude, but when my thoughts are tangled, for example, i’ve found that starting a voice memo and talking to myself out loud helps me warm up my brain better. but other ~reasons could be “perfectionism” and/or fear of not doing justice to your own ideas: https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1352123604. or maybe there’s a feeling of insurmountableness to the visual of the blank page: https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1332656540. <br><br>or maybe you just expect it to be intuitive, when the truth is often that the less you write, the more painful it might be in the beginning until you find your momentum, and that (in most cases, not all) is even more reason to still keep at it when it’s not going well: https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1327446681 <br><br>if the only viable path in a maze is blocked, your only choices are to go back the way you came and keep not writing, or put your all into pushing however long it takes until you arrive at a different crossway. even if you have to use your own spit to lube up the edges of the block. with writing, most of the time (not always), you’re going to have to be comfortable with pushing on even when you don’t like how it feels. sometimes you’ll have to fake it till you make it. an angel isn’t going to pay us a visit and award us the divine gift of writing, and even if one did, we’ll still have to find a way to best relay the word of god. it’s not a matter of will or lack thereof to become a writing machine overnight. you have to start with baby steps. there’s no shame in that. if you did two lines a day everyday for a month, that’s sixty lines. in a year, that’s 720. none of those numbers are zero. and if all of them are terrible, then that’s 720 more lines than zero to edit, you know? <br><br>in case you might be thinking writing is supposed to feel a certain way (easy, or quick, or efficient) bc that’s how it seems for other people — then i think you’ll find that those kinds of writers are the outlier. even ovens need to be preheated to optimize their baking prowess, &amp; there are recipes that someone has already perfected. craft &amp; process and the end result are the same.<br><br>all i know is — the fact that you’re sitting down to try and write at all is worth more than you might realize. i know this is likely nothing you haven’t heard before, but i hope i haven’t been too harsh. thank you so much so for your kind words, and i’m sorry i couldn’t give a better answer.</div>

 <div class=question>Ahhh I’m so glad you liked the songs! I love recommending songs and sharing them with people so I’m very glad to hear that you appreciate receiving them :) I love Maggie Rogers, she’s one of my all time favs, so I fully support listening through her discography if you so desire lol. But I would also like to humbly offer two more of my favorites for your consideration 🤲:<br>Dog Years - this one feels more like skow than flls, but I think it reflects the way Yuuji and Megumi’s relationship has grown and matured after their reunion in a really lovely way -&gt; “come what may/I’ll still stay/inside your mind/for all of time/singing, ooh/we will be alright”<br>The Knife - this one makes me think of Yuuji confessing to Megumi in ch3 and how he desperately doesn’t want to mess things up but he also desperately needs to tell him how he feels -&gt; “the knife of insight tore its way in me/a brash collision without sympathy” “And I know and I know and I know/that maybe we should take some time/get this out, make this right/maybe when the sun goes down/I’ll come round, tell you all about [it]” (I love how vivid her lyrics are in this one, it always makes me feel so much, like my chest is about to burst open)<br>Anywho, I hope you like these too! Thanks again for letting us share songs with you and for writing such a beautiful story that I know will stay with me for a long, long time 💕💕 I hope all is well!!</div>

 <div class=reply>i hope you can forgive me for taking two whole months to reply to this, holy crap, but your recs had me revisiting the playlist probably for the first time since it was made and it got to a point where i had to sit down and just do a massive clean-up job — which is to say thank you to You and all the others who think of flls music for putting so much thought &amp; care into what goes into that playlist. it makes me want to be even more careful and intentional with what i contribute to it 💗<br><br>i’ll get around to adding these ones to the playlist as soon as i can too! i’m just. very much not a person right now. i already love both songs on a personal level but want to sit down with them as flls/skow-centric songs sometime. i think something interesting about flls is that there’s like. an undercurrent of violence in the way they feel about each other. almost as if i had to rely on jjk canon-typical metaphors and rhetoric to externalize their love even in an au. which is to say that the lyrics in “the knife” really captures that momentum in their relationship that will eventually hurtle towards a car crash. just. the language being full of kinetic energy: the knife of insight *tore* its way *in* me, *hit* me *up*, how it all *pours out* — you know? <br><br>i adore these recs &amp; the ones before !! it’s getting redundant perhaps to keep saying this but thank you for caring about flls !! not just reading it, but caring about it to such degrees. seriously. thank you.</div>

 <div class=reply>i seriously need to get a new personality trait bc i feel like it’s the only book i talk about but... franny and zooey 🙂‍↕️ it’s really a short story + novella usually combined into a “novel” format, though. i’ve got some thoughts from my latest reread if you want to poke fun: https://literal.club/regressor/book/j-d-salingerfranny-and-zooey-2cozm <br><br>salinger in general has a way with characters that i grudgingly appreciate and still at times aspire to — but maybe it’s just the way i’ve grown up with this book and had it change with me. i fell in love through franny during my first read and through zooey in my latest and maybe someday i’ll outgrow how much i feel for both of them but there’s just so much there that i can’t even imagine it depleting to nothing. i can’t think of a book i feel about the exact same way i feel about f&amp;z. it’s almost nauseating. <br><br>there’s adam parrish from the raven cycle as well, but that’s more of a personal feeling and not necessarily wholly of the story. he saved my life more than i wanted to save his (which in a way is saying a lot bc adam’s whole deal is that his friends wanted to love him by saving him, yet it’s not salvation for him if it isn’t of his own making). it’s a mix of both subjective and objective love in this case, intense enough to earn him a tattoo. <br><br>and, though also not strictly a novel, the aeneid…? i was spiralling the other night bc my periodic aeneas thoughts decided to strike out of nowhere. i skulked around some classics blogs bc i Know other people must feel the same, and when someone said “aeneas has been dying for ages and then is finally dead in book 12 even when he's still alive” and pointed to “the slow erasure of aeneas' sense of self over the course of the poem, the increase in violence &amp; decrease in tears &amp; other feelings” — felt like i’ve been shot. it never gets old. aeneas, my honorary regressor... no ancient greek hero comes close to the emotions you taught me i could experience.<br><br>i have so many other characters i feel for, just maybe not to the same degree of lifelong fervency. characters like frances from conversations with friends, natalie from hangsaman, theo from the goldfinch, cyril from the heart’s invisible furies—to name a few. i’m sure i felt so much for all the characters in le petit prince. gatsby, even. camus’ meursault, whose literary persona i can’t help but be protective of. i’m still very attached to hareton from wuthering heights, though he’s not technically a main character. on some level a part of me can’t help but feel a lot for the narrator of any story i do deeply love, since stories like that have only gotten rarer as i have grown up. some mc loves are over sooner, and it only so happens that the ones i named have stood the test of time.</div>

 <div class=question>sha! i have a writing question for you as someone who has been struggling to complete fics for the past year while still having an abundance of ideas but just... not having the discipline to execute them and reach the finish line, or finding the marathon to be a struggle to go through in general even though the prep (outlining) is what i find to be fun... (pain) how much planning goes into your fic writing process? how much do you outline? what's the biggest number of times that you've revised a draft? what does your process look like in general? (that was more than one question, oops.) <br><br>on a completely separate note... have you ever listened to twice's cheer up? because there's an infamous part in that song that goes, "shy shy shy!" but what comes out is "sha sha sha!". and that's what my brain thinks of when i type your name. 🥹 i hope you have a lovely day. 💛</div>

 <div class=reply>i can’t outline at all, actually! i’ve tried, but i just do not have the brain for them. i’m more comfortable (and have more fun) if i get right into a blank doc and do everything as the need arises: editing, research, notes, ideas. often, a story is born bc of a Point B i want to get to, but i don’t necessarily know where that point will be in a story. that’s for the writing to help me figure out. sometimes i even abandon the original trigger altogether. i just find it easier to consider multiple possibilities and choices as i go along, even if i must write whole scenes before realizing they’re useless. at which point they will go to a separate graveyard doc so i don’t think too much about slashing it. <br><br>i’ve found it’s best to start with what’s easiest to write, which for me would be dialogue. i get them out of the way in the roughest form possible as they come to me. here’s an example: <br><br>“There is no pursuit of knowledge that is worth human lives.” <br><br>“What about one life, then?”<br><br>“Oh, Doctor.” / “You can’t possibly think any of this is righteous. You may belong to a tower with windows but it is a tower all the same.”<br><br>this is gibberish. it has no value without context. but it’s something to build a potential scene around, &amp; from here, i’ll add texture with body language &amp; speaker tags, and finally, i’ll get to the plot &amp; introspection, which would be easier bc it’s essentially just commentary on an existing scene. then i can decide what’s worth keeping when i’m editing. (the biggest number of times i’ve reworked a complete draft is around 21, to answer that question… 7 for a single chapter, i think.) <br><br>the idea is to go in the order of what you find easiest, so that by the time you get to the one that demands the most of you, you have as much of the story built as possible to support you. what in your outline is the easiest for you to put down on the page? is it the location? one specific character? then when you have these little scattered bits/flags, fill in the connections between them as best as you can. give them a reason to be all together in the story. if it helps, paraphrase the points in what you have like you’re explaining it to someone from memory. working on small parts is a good thing — it just means you’re building. they’ll add up. so play to your strengths. you have them; overwhelm your “weaknesses” with numbers. you don’t have to do it all in order, nor all at once. if a scene isn’t cooperating, that’s not a judgment of you. there are other kids you have to feed. you can come back later and reassess. <br><br>i’m out of space and painfully aware this isn’t coherent, but i hope there’s smth here that could be helpful. for what it’s worth, as frustrating as it must be, sometimes it’s not a matter of discipline but the simple fact that pursuit of The Process is ever unfolding. it’s okay. you’ll find it.<br><br>and ahhhh that is the cutest little note to end on… i’m honoured to be invoked by the definitive sana part 🥹</div>

 <div class=question>Hello! I’ve been re-reading flls and that combined with the cc you posted a bit ago about the period of time between Yuuji and Megumi’s breakup/reunion has had me listening to some of the songs on my playlist in a new light if that makes sense? They’ve just been on my mind and suddenly these songs make me think of them and get a little emotional lol. I hope it’s okay if I share those songs here? <br>-Maybe You Saved Me by PVRIS &amp; Bad Suns: this one doesn’t really fit the vibes I get from your flls playlist, but the lyrics really reminded me of what you said in the cc, that they had to lose each other in order to grow and learn more about themselves. I keep thinking of the lines “I wanna call you up to say/I wanna hear you found your way/I’m hoping when the seasons change we’re both in better days” 🥲<br>-New Song by Maggie Rogers &amp; Del Water Gap: this one makes me picture the way you described Yuuji &amp; Megumi the night/day after the breakup, it just feels very bittersweet, especially the part that goes “keep me inside of your mind when you’re aching/lord ‘cause for now we’re mistaken/in thinking we fit”<br>-I Still Do by Maggie Rogers: this one gets me every time 😭 it makes me think of the breakup scene, and the whole chorus feels so much like flls Yuuji and reminds me of when he tells Megumi “I really loved you like hell, as best I knew how”<br>I’m sorry this turned into such a long message, I hope it isn’t overwhelming in any way! Thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts/ramblings, even if you choose not to respond in a cc. Hope you’re doing well 🩷</div>

 <div class=reply>it is more than okay to share songs with me are you kidding !! i love getting them !! i love long messages, too, if you couldn’t tell from how i reply. thank you for contributing some life into the flls playlist 🫂<br><br>but also you know that scene in midsommar where all the women are gathered around florence pugh sobbing in pursuit of some kind of ritualistic catharsis? that’s how all of these made me feel. like i want to claw out of my chest. devastating. but at least we are in #community. <br><br>this part in maybe you saved me goes out to all my flls ch4 rereaders out there: <br><br>I watched you crash<br>I watched you burn<br>I helped you pick the pieces up<br>I couldn't give you what you deserved<br>Sometimes my best ain't good enough<br><br>rest assured i’m going to go through all of these and find them their right spot in the playlist order somewhere, but you made me realize that it doesn’t have nearly enough maggie rogers. like — “but [love] is always a reason to risk it all / at least the way that i loved you” ??? “i don't want to leave you even though i have to / i don't want to love you / oh, i still do” ???? a full discography audit might be in order.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha, i’ve been following you as a writer for quite a while and finally got around to reading so it goes and wow, i have so many thoughts about it. i really love the way you’ve portrayed both bachira and rin, but especially, especially rin. they seem so human in it that it kind of makes my heart ache. and god, do i love a second love story. maybe it’s just because i’m just getting over a breakup but this fic really scratched an itch in my head that i didn’t even know was there. i think it might be my favourite piece of yours ever, though i’ll give you something so real is a close second. anyway, ramblings aside, i just wanted to ask about your thought process behind the fic, if that’s okay? i read your posts about flls and your other recent fics on tumblr and i have some of the same questions about sig, like how did it start, was all of it planned out or was it one of those that took you on a journey you never expected? if you don’t want to answer, that’s alright too :) thank you so much for writing and for sharing it. you’re an inspiration to me</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my, oh my… thank you so much. for this message, for reading my writing all this time. i admit i don’t spend as much time bonding with my canonverse fics so it’s always doubly touching to see them receive such warm, sincere kindness. so it goes especially is the one fic that Shocks me every time with the love it receives, so much so that i might have developed a special soft spot for sig readers. thank you for being part of that. <br><br>one of the rnbc wips i had before sig was a time loop fic of the day of isagi’s wedding, inspired by artwork where rin catches bachira staring during isagi’s wedding and (as a callback to the u20 match) tells him, “look only at me from now on.” i was like whoa! rin-chan! but that image amplified thoughts that would form sig: how rin’s life reflects this almost angry begging to be seen, for the effort he puts in to be certified in some way, for someone to hand him a place that he can trust to remain stable bc of how much he can’t help but give to it. yet it’s his misfortune that he asks this of things that already belonged to something else before he came along, and that he has only known love that had to be repossessed. like soccer, like sae. my ideal sophoclean ending for rin will always be early retirement due to smth unforeseen, so i wanted to take that &amp; crank up all his other issues towards one object. if bachira’s arc is about hunger &amp; having to embrace selfishness (and the loneliness of that) to escape scarcity, then how would this catalyze rin’s need to be seen and to have a place that’s his?<br><br>my fics do tend to start with one scene in mind, but the path towards that is unbeknownst to even me until it’s written 😭 for sig, the scene that necessitated 60k words was the guernica moment, then i just tried to gather as many of my bookmarked rnbc art to write scenes around bc more themes kept falling into my lap: rnbc’s shared concept of fate, how rin will only ever be bachira’s soulmate by choice, not destiny, &amp; what a responsibility and privilege that is; starting anew in both love and life for people who thought forever would last a lot longer than it did; the quiet of stability after so long in a storm you learned to live with; imagining an older bachira’s relationship with loneliness, etc. <br><br>i often wish sig was neater, that i spent more time on it, but smth about it also feels uniquely rin. plus it gave me my fav line to write all of last year with “good. that means it was love, too. between me and soccer.” it’s the privilege of writing that i get to leave rnbc being each other’s unequivocal first after a lifetime of wondering — though even i was surprised how... sunlit? the result turned out to be. it’s always so full of light in my mind, so it goes. i’m honoured i get to share it with hearts like yours, so thank you for letting me talk about it a bit as well 💛</div>

 <div class=question>Your approach to writing reminds me of maths in the way that maths is also a language, one of logic and balance. Writing can be as redundant as maths in certain cases and subjects. But ideas around subject over style isn’t what I came here to say. I came here to say you’re the equivalent of those people who can skip all the extra steps in a sum and just write the simplified final answer. And I don’t mean that in the sense that your writing is simple, but to mean that you your words cut to the quick, reach the core of what it is you’re communicating. As imperfect as communicating always is. You just seem to transcend miles of thought to skip way ahead to a single line that floors me every time. You keep me writing.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, this makes my heart ache so terribly — in a good way. in the best way. heart-shattering like a shooting star cutting through the sky out of seemingly nowhere. <br><br>i see writing and language the same way — formulaic, a matter of balancing — and have found it sad here and there that there isn’t really a way to liken it to math without making it seem like i’m clinicalizing or sterilizing it. it is math to me. it is seeing the shape of a sentence and knowing this side of this clause won’t get you the variables you’ll need for the next one. i think that’s part of what makes writing thrilling: the search, the ratios, all these infinite variables you’re holding with each sentence you begin to write, until you reach the moment it all cuts away and you point to the thing you’re looking for. i don’t know if i’m successful more often than i’m not in pursuing that final answer, as you say, but it’s incredibly moving to hear someone say this and understand on such a visceral level what i see in my head. utterly devastating, this entire message. i feel my debt to your way with words in this twinge in my chest. thank you so much.</div>

 <div class=reply>i feel… so much older than being in my 20s, haha. like what do you mean we’re only halfway there! how much more wisdom is there to learn! i feel like i’ve been 30 since i was 3. like i’ve been 40 since i was 4. like i must be hundreds of years old now in spirit. i don’t know. the years go by so quick, ironically. i forget to find anything to hold onto to ground myself. there’s freedom in that, in a way.<br><br>the good part is that i’ve come to embrace my 20s as a period of acceptance. of what and who i am, of the way i think, of what i’m willing to do to preserve this thing i call my self. i’m not especially interested in exploring the unknown anymore, not like i was in my late teens. i think i believed that if i pursued hunger i did not actually feel, that would give my life momentum that belonged solely to me. or maybe i believed the quantity of the unknown made it something worth breaking down. i don’t know if i trust anything to be unknown anymore. i feel like… the world continues on and on, in these cycles that you can see approaching from five years away, and the age number changes but the cycle starts anew when it’s time to. <br><br>i have come to accept as well that i have no love left for the world. there’s a very fine line i’m toeing here before misanthropy hurtles me towards somewhere else, but my lack of love for the world now doesn’t mean i don’t want that for other people, or to have something close to love to share with others. i think i’m transitioning into the idea that i’m not seeking to leave a mark on my life, but i also don’t intend to leave it worse than before i was here. if i can leave it better, that’d be great. i’ve done everything i can, and i’m satisfied to know that my pursuit of perfection has been successful enough to leave me invulnerable — to the injustice of this ever degrading world, to my family’s, to whoever else’s. what i sought to protect me will always protect me. as edgy as that sounds, it’s strange to reach a point where that feels true and stable. i know the choices i made when i needed to, and i intend to live the rest of my life trusting what i know and welcoming what i don’t bc i know it won’t change me. i’m prepared to make the hard choices. i’ve always made them, but i wasn’t prepared at the time. now, i am. <br><br>i guess that really is it. my 20s have been a period of accepting that i’m prepared for whatever living will ask of me, and i won’t be upset if it turns out there’s nothing left to ask. i have no grief about what i did or didn’t do. ofc there’ll always be thoughts of what i’ve lost, but in the end, getting older is just sinking deeper into the warmth of a lake inside me that i always thought i couldn’t swim within. i hope that doesn’t sound melancholy — it’s a gentle thought in my mind. so are my 20s, now. the water is still.</div>

 <div class=reply>the way i’m actually giddy that you’ve caught me in a rare instance of having a single, simple answer to this question omg — i work in editorial! my formal title is editorial specialist, if that means anything. it’s just a fancy-ish title for how there’s a common saying in my team that “if you can’t find a fix, that’s for sha to remix.” <br><br>i just clock in and look at whatever files and cases of the week are on my desk. sometimes it’s policy review for the teachers’ board, sometimes it’s research and archival work for an art gallery’s exhibition book, sometimes it’s interviewing authors for a promotional campaign to hand over to the publicity department. the nature of the work is technically writing and editing based, which is what i thought i was going to be doing all the time, but in practice i’m paid a lot of money to be a hater and find problems in things then figure out how to fix it and make it look like they were never there. the point of me is to make it seem like there was no me, my manager always says. not unlike a mafia goon. could definitely be way worse.</div>

 <div class=reply>literal.club has been the only site to stick with me! it’s not the most varied database yet (there have been so many titles i’ve had to submit myself), but it’s the cleanest interface of the ones i’ve tried. it does everything i need it to, and the elements i don’t need are not in my face. this is my account if you haven’t been before: https://literal.club/regressor 🍓<br><br>i have several issues with goodreads as a site, and while i’d love to use storygraph, it just doesn’t… aesthetically… agree with me. literal’s primary deal maker for me was that they don’t show average ratings of books, but i think it’s also just the nicest middle ground of having a place to log and review some of my books without the extra kerfuffle and cluttered interface of other sites. it looks nice (most of the time), it’s straightforward for me to use and navigate (most of the time), and i am able to use it the way i prefer most social media, where i have just a small space to keep up with what friends are reading/thinking/saying without being overwhelmed. for now, as far as i know, it also has no ties to amazon. this might all change in the future, but right now, i’m pretty comfortable on there and am attached enough that i’d be terribly disappointed if the site were to close down.</div>

 <div class=question>Hi Sha!! I found you on twitter after binging all of your jjk fics. They ripped me to the core. Your prose is so introspective and rich that I find it filtering into the way I think. The surgical precision with which you dissect characters blows me away and I’m astounded at how whole and real they feel. As a 23 old trying to figure out what to do with my life I was wondering what your journey as a writer has been like? What did you study if you did? What do you take inspiration from and what sharpens thoughts?</div>

 <div class=reply>this message is so wonderfully worded... like the perfectly round spoonful of ice cream i had at the park yesterday. still thinking about it, as will i this message. thank you so much for this burst of cool sweetness on a humid day 🙁🤍 <br><br>my journey as a writer hasn’t really been much! i certainly never dreamed to be a capital w writer, and it’s not a priority in my life plans; it more so just happens that writing exists within the toolbox of all the interests i’ve had so far. i wonder often if what people connect with in my writing style is just a natural result of observing my characters like they’re real people. which they are to me, if only for a time. i think of it like this: i’ve loved characters from the moment i realized i could, and the same for language, and that’s how i came to try writing. i haven’t stopped since — only found more characters to love, and more languages, and therefore more writing.<br><br>i did study classics &amp; linguistics in uni, though, to your question. i’d be lying if i say i don’t see their influence on my writing style, but it feels unfair to credit only formal education when i know my writing has gone through so many changes and have had to adapt so many times in all the years i’ve been doing it. i’ve been writing fan &amp; personal fiction since i was a kid, sure, but i did also abandon fiction for a couple of years and just did different kinds of journalism. sometimes i participate in my friends’ songwriting sessions, or write screenplays for their short films. i have learned so much from it all, especially the ones i’m not great at, so it’s maybe more that i’m just always searching for the next writing high, and when i find something, i pull it apart so i can lay out all the parts in front of me. i’m more of an eternal student to the real writers, maybe? <br><br>this is gearing towards very pretentious, but i think that’s what gives me inspiration — the dissection, &amp; the fun i find in it. i love finding stories that i don’t have prior experience deconstructing! it’s a great day when i find something i don’t know much about yet. it’s games right now, but this time two years ago it was acting. on that front, writing’s purpose is to do the learning with me; it helps me in my willingness to try anything to keep thoughts sharp, as you’ve put into perfect words.<br><br>i’m not sure if these answer your questions, but i guess my point to end on would just be that. any life journey is a writing journey. no matter what age or background. writing is a life companion; it has experienced the same things i have, &amp; has its own perspectives to offer to me in return that i wouldn’t have discovered otherwise. i don’t find my writing very groundbreaking, but it’s a writing style (and writing journey) that works With me, and that i benefit from bc of its utility. my writing is my best friend. a thoroughbred horse companion. it can be temperamental, but we’ve done a hundred races together, &amp; will continue until we can’t anymore.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, i’m not sure if eclectic can ever apply to me, haha. but i see what you’re asking, though i’ll have to disappoint and say that when it comes to animanga in particular, i’m more a product of proximity than anything else. it’s the only thing in my media history that predates books, so i always think of it as something given to me more than i ever sought it out. it’s the first language of story the world spoke to me in, as bizarre as that is to say about anime. (the first “novel” i wrote was literally based on an isekai anime that came out in 2004. the first fanfic i wrote was also for a 2004 manga. isn’t that funny?) <br><br>if there’s any accounting for my current tastes, it’s maybe my continued loyalty to older forms &amp; traditions of anime... so. i’d say it’s less eclectic and more just testament to a lifetime of collecting anime the way i have all the books i’ve ever loved. i’ve had time to figure out what i like and don’t like, with anything. that’s really all. it’s just time. shoujo, shounen, seinen, josei, otome or edgy or disgusting or whatever — i’ve had time to sate much of my curiosity, and time to develop a compass for what curiosities no longer need sating, then i do it all over again with other things. if that makes sense.<br><br>i can’t say i’ve ever thought about what goes into curating my media, so i apologize if i’m answering rather indirectly. if i have any advice to give here, i’d say that cultivating a taste compass you can trust is far more sustainable than having a mental checklist of things to go through. be curious, pay attention to what you don’t know (yet), pursue to extremes and specifics. dig and dig. most media i’ve loved, i stumbled upon by accident and simply pursued a feeling i’d be into it. you’ll find that the more of a place you’ve mapped, the more intuitively you’ll find unexplored paths.<br><br>as for general media habits, though, i’m an advocate for digging into the older work of an author who blew up for something. i found my all-time favs that way: urasawa’s best work to me is pluto, not monster. i like pizza delivery man and the gold palace, but my way with you is (i think) upi’s best. yonezawa honobu is known for hyouka, but i found that i love the shoshimin series more. i also recommend looking into studios/directors/authors who made the stuff you like, or finding the translation team behind a manga/manhwa you want more of &amp; reading all the series they’re working on.<br><br>this is. not an organized reply. i am so sorry. ultimately, i don’t think there’s really any “teaching” taste. people with famous favs might think they have niche tastes, but vice versa as well. i always say nothing is niche bc everything is niche to some audience; if you let your tastes run wild anyway, eventually you’ll find there is nothing you haven’t gotten to before some other demographic does. the only constant is you knowing for a fact that you like what you like.</div>

 <div class=reply>i previously answered a half-similar question to the first half of your message if you don’t mind me linking it here! i still stand by the dynamics i mentioned there https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1337473097 <br><br>but now you also got me thinking about the particular potency of siblinghood in the context of sisters… i have neither a sister nor a maternal relationship with my mother (who has So many sisters) though i do have older cousins who have a close yet oddly fraught relationship as a pair of sisters close in age with two separate maternal figures. i definitely see a palpable difference there compared to my experience growing up with a younger brother surrounded by volatile men. my brother’s very vocal about what a huge influence i’ve been on him, but i understand i’m not much of an easy person to be raised by. the resentment goes both ways in my experience of siblinghood, and i guess that has informed my own taste in sibling dynamics. i’m very much shiv roy in the final episode of succession going, “i love you, but i can’t stand you.” <br><br>so i tend to like family dynamics/tropes where it’s all… “you’ve influenced me (or vice versa) in some irreparable way. that is your right. i wouldn’t have it any other way. but sometimes i do wonder if i would have loved you without being tied to you by social contract/blood obligations.” or some degree of parentification and growing apart in order to heal. i can’t see myself ever becoming a sibling to my own brother, in the same way my biological parents will always be like distant much older siblings to me, so it’s extra interesting when narratives explore the tricky ground there in whatever way. there’s a lot that goes into the social and gender dynamics of broken/unstable homes, esp when you have characters like zuko &amp; azula or the succession siblings being actively puppeteered by their relationship with an abusive father. they don’t always lead to the portrayals of trauma in azula or the roys. sometimes it hardens you. sometimes you swear never to let anyone take away your independence again. sometimes you don’t want anyone to understand. but a sibling fucks up all of that, bc they were also there. sometimes, they’re even the cause of hurt that continues. so. i like fraught sibling relationships. i like dynamics with differences in worldviews &amp; life paths despite the softness that remains.<br><br>but anyway! poems about sisters growing apart… i can think of quite a few about losing/growing apart from a brother and/or siblings in general but ones for sisters specifically… the only one that comes to mind is tango by louise gluck. one of those classic melancholy of sisterhood poems, i guess. maybe two sisters, one thinner, one better dressed by beth ann fennelly. but i’m afraid that’s it, &amp; i’m sorry i can’t offer more specifics, but i do have a tag for siblings-related themes if it might be of some use: https://nswers.tumblr.com/tagged/a%20shovel%20for%20a%20brother</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! how are you? super late to the party but am reading the blood chamber by angela carter. it’s my first time reading her and ?! i’m only four pages in but god she’s got me out of my reading slump so effortlessly. reading her makes me think of tartt’s prose, where each sentence has a kind of rhythm to it? i was wondering if you had any other authors that might come to mind—reading has been so hard these days but i’m finding so much want when i read carter, and i want that want to stay. thanks! hope you’re taking care &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>angela carter !!!! oh, that’s some good stuff. i’ve only read her screenplays and short stories, but she has a knack for a particular rhythm that makes it easy to just flow along with her despite the density. when i think about the kind of prose you need to have for magical realism and/or folklore retellings, carter’s style is one of those that come to mind — though ofc that doesn’t necessarily define her work. there’s an illusion of effortlessness to it, and i think part of that is this very clear archaic-ness to the way she writes. it’s a breath of fresh air especially after you’ve been reading contemporary writers for a while. <br><br>to that point, i think carter’s narration, at least in her short story collection, is very reminiscent to me of the go-between by l.p. harley. there’s that same instinct about gathering clauses as part of this bigger whole that would become a sentence. heavy and intent on melody, unafraid to utilize adverbs, kinda in that middle ground between talking to you as a reader but also painting on a landscape canvas. i’ve been slowly getting into stefan zweig this year, and i’d throw any of his works in the running. a bit farther out, but also: the invention of morel by adolfo bioy casares, the kites by romain gary, likely anything by evelyn waugh but brideshead revisited especially, and (more of a staccato tempo in their prose, though still distinctly flowy) the sea the sea by iris murdoch + the music of chance by paul aster. if you’re down for more of a mystery/noir/gillian flynn vibe, dorothy b. hughes also has some underrated titles with some of that vintage penguin classics flow.<br><br>i also hope you’re taking care! makes me so glad when i hear someone has gotten out of their reading slump, so thank you for dropping by and sharing your reads with me 💗</div>

 <div class=reply>i hear you :( i decided 2024 is the year i stop being such a staunch summer hater, so i’ve resolved to try being kinder to both the season and myself during these months… but. it’s a work in progress. i think spring and summer will always be a touch too loaded with personal baggage for me, and i struggle to imagine ever missing the sun, but i Have been reading out on the porch more these days. might even go crazy this week and start going on daily walks. i’ve set myself up with a summer playlist and been trying to do summery things more (i.e. literally just drink juice and eat food i associate with the season). it doesn’t come naturally to me — even my attempts to make peace with it feel like i’m just trying to make the time pass until i no longer have to put up with it, you know? — but it’s been helped a lot by the regular rain we’ve been getting in between the worst of the heat. as they say, the time with pass anyway. might as well colour it in with texture and sensation. <br><br>i think… summer just reaches me the way starlight reaches us on earth. that kind of melancholy awe-awareness over something that took light years for us to witness and may have died a long time ago. stars are bittersweet like that, and in summer it’s like everything around you is reaching out in desperation towards the biggest star in the sky. which technically it is. but it is a collective revival ritual that makes me wish i believed in the god we’re worshipping. instead summer just feels like living inside an echo of something long gone and might no longer be there if we ever trace it to the source. i’m just not sure what the something is. if that makes sense. idk what exactly i mean, either.<br><br>wind breaker is super fun! a friend got me to watch bc they joked that suo is like if you combined the designs of two of my fav characters (murai from blue period &amp; ruan mei from honkai star rail) — but he’s his own character, ofc. i’m predictable and love what little we’ve seen of him, especially how the anime did the “kind, you say? is that the face of a gentleman.” / “he doesn’t even have a shred of kindness.” scene. <br><br>more broadly, i don’t love the plot, but i do enjoy the characters. i don’t think i’m the target audience anymore for the feel-good friend group journey to being a hero thing that stories like wind breaker embody, so i’m not really attached to it as a Story story, but i do look forward to weekends i get to catch up. it’s reliable new age shounen so far, which i value on its own right. cloverworks also just does beautifully with the art for the most part, and you can’t really ever remain immune to the Guy Distrustful of Goodwill Learns What It’s Like To Be Part Of A Community That Looks Out For Each Other tropes. all in all a great spring anime to get me primed for my summer shows, and i’ll be continuing to tune in 😊</div>

 <div class=reply>i hope it’s okay to link an older reply! https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1326638473 <br><br>among those, for a reading slump, i’d like to double underline cold enough for snow by jessica au &amp; the two works by elisa shua dusapin. i think those two authors have the kind of no-nonsense prose that just brings you on a gentle flow without much effort on your end to hold on, while still giving you enough substance in terms of atmosphere and reflection. other shorter books i’ve enjoyed in the last year or so are the hole by hiroko oyamada, the employees by olga ravn, &amp; chess by stefan zweig, but they all have more of a… presence? idk how to describe it. some books, you don’t have to step fully and disappear into to be swept away in it. they need not consume you for you to consume it. but these three books did for me, despite their short length. the books by jessica au and elisa shua dusapin feel more like sketches of a world, as if someone handed you their sketchbook after they returned from an overseas trip. <br><br>i’m looking through my bookshelf and — may i recommend some short story collections as well? shoko’s smile by choi eunyoung, five days in winter by lily king, and either collection by alexander weinstein, were all rather easy reads if i recall correctly. ofc the strength of the author varies from story to story, but i find sometimes that it’s easier to finish a book during a slump when they have clear opportunities for me to take a break. it’s also easier to keep up with changes in what i want to read if i’m just reading from story to story. but anyway. i wish you all the best with getting out of the reading slump, through these recs or elsewhere.</div>

 <div class=reply>this one really made me think a while — i suppose i don’t really conceptualize reading as a separate act? it’s kinda just. a thing i must do. not like a chore or a hobby, or even an actionable survival need like eating, but like breathing, as cliché as that is to say. i don’t consciously think of desiring it and can trust my body to know what feels right or wrong, but if i were to suddenly stop doing it, i’d notice at once and without it i’ll. you know. die. <br><br>ofc it’s indulgence/escapism for some books, &amp; other times it’s a desire to learn more about something, but it’s never like Ah, Now It Is Time To Read. my mother asked me once why i never stuck with other vices, and i was surprised to honestly reply that i’ve never found anything that felt as good as a reading high. i think life will sooner feel like an interruption of time that i could spend reading than vice versa. what i’m reading changes with my moods, by the hour, what language/vibe/locale i miss today, etc. i think maybe it’s more so that i seek a constant flow of words that feel good to witness. sometimes it’s a profile of sofia coppola or other times it’s a light novel in korean — i’ll take anything with a rhythm i can bask in, and the rest depends on my whims. i guess reading is a way for me to feel close to words and/or stories. it’s like prayer in that. which sounds pompous. i know. but.<br><br>all this said, i struggle to find anything you should feel guilty for? i find that when people start reading when they were younger, what they develop is the physical habit of it; they’re motivated by the availability and novelty of books as a kid, and maybe that translates to love, but not necessarily lifelong Reading. it’s easier for people who have always read to just start and get into it, logistics-wise, but even people who were young readers yet haven’t graduated from middle grade reading will be outside of their comfort zone their first time reading a new kind of book. i also think engagement with the material — and thirst for knowledge like yours — are a completely separate thing you must hone in its own right. and your 20s is a great time! i’ve loved books as a kid/teen that i loved for completely different reasons in my 20s once i reread them. books i hated before, i love now. there are readers in their 30s stuck in the reading habits of their high school selves, and there are elementary school kids with the reading habits of boomers. <br><br>people talk a lot about books bringing us to different worlds, but i think it’s equally true that we take books with us to our worlds. sometimes you have to be in a midlife crisis to access the tenderness only possible with certain stories at that age. reading is a mental exercise much like anything else, and if you ask me, it’d never be something to feel guilty for any more than you would if you were winded after a jog compared to someone who’s been in competitive track and field since they were 9.</div>

 <div class=question>not sure if you've been asked this before (sorry if you have been) but do you have any thoughts on madeline miller's 'the song of achilles'? i found it derivative and childish personally but there are some bits of prose i actually enjoyed (chiron's tangent on nations being the most foolish of inventions; achilles killing the snake; the constant invocation of fate; patroclus comparing himself to a raven; achilles' battle between wanting to maintain power vs. wanting to love patroclus; the anti-blue eyes line; "you can use a spear as a walking stick but that will not change its nature").</div>

 <div class=reply>i hope you don’t mind if i quote someone else bc i think filmnoirsbian on tmblr worded it best: <br><br>“i used to extend it quite a bit of grace for various reasons but at this point conversations about classics/myth retellings/etc have become so oversaturated with undue praise for what is a shallow ya romance at best [...] inspiring a wave of retellings in pop lit which do nothing to interact with or expand on the source in any meaningful way which renders them essentially meaningless, empty husks of what the original stories once were, that now I find all of it annoying. <br><br>tags: #i will never begrudge Igbt people who found tsoa at a vulnerable time in their lives and felt seen and reflected by it #but otherwise it is simply not good. imo.”<br><br>there’s also an older rant i posted bc of this classics account that i followed closely in uni: https://x.com/sleeptowns/status/1537300512349081600?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw that’s more about the contemporary wave of ~progressive classics retellings than tsoa specifically, but i doubt you can have that conversation without centering tsoa and the generation of readers who revere it. <br><br>the thing is, as far as i’ve seen and been part of, classics spaces do not think kindly of tsoa. madeline miller’s books are a joke that gets a giggle and a sneer, which you can argue is partly due to embedded elitism about — like you said, and i agree — an obviously childish piece of work + an antiquated expectation that classics must remain serious and inaccessible. it’s a bizarre comparison to mary renault’s works, for example, which for all their fictionalizing remains properly engaged with by historians and classicists. <br><br>with all that in mind, i can’t help but receive tsoa as bad fanfiction written by someone who only watched the movie instead of also reading the book it was based on. it tried to be homeric, in those examples you mentioned and in the mythologizing it thought it was doing well, but i think it’s always quite palpable when the work is biting off more than it can chew by trying to participate in practices and conversations older than they can fathom. there was an attempt. it wasn’t enough to salvage the book, on its own right or with the classics tag attached to it. <br><br>all of this is fine. it’s whatever. my only real problem with tsoa is that it’s badly written on top of the broader criticism. shallow characterization, hollow prose, juvenile structuring. pick a struggle. it’s disappointing bc the iliad is Such a resonant narrative, with characters many love and can talk about in all their complexity. there’s also just a pervading atmosphere that bleeds through, and even in spinning it as a coming-of-age romance, you should have been able to capture at least some of that by default. there’s a sense reading tsoa that it was a pick-and-choose situation; the result, i feel, is a book more interested in the bells and whistles than in being of any substance. i prefer to forget it exists.</div>

 <div class=question>Hi! You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to, but I was curious if you like to listen to anything while you write? Or do you find noise distracting? I personally prefer writing in silence, or if my surroundings are loud, I put my headphones on and listen to brown noise (slightly less harsh to me, compared to white noise), because I find lyrics/music too distracting while I’m working on something</div>

 <div class=reply>it depends… silence is preferable most of the time, but it also need not be absolute? with writing specifically, i can usually tune out anything that isn’t at max volume right by my ear as long as i find my momentum. i’ve even found here and there that white/brown noise can be more distracting for me than whatever ambient sounds are available around. i’m with you completely on the no lyrics thing, though! that’s where i’d also draw the line in terms of distraction. <br><br>i do keep a playlist for reading/writing music, but it’s more for when there’s something specific i need to drown out: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7lD5mDMUEWabj4Ss9WXrhk?si=c0c4294cf26b4a96 in cases where my focus won’t stay on task and i really need to wrestle it into line, however, i find only math rock works magic on my brain: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0F9N9EdxOZp68B0iF6qWYN?si=7a4b702a597b4fe4 <br><br>if i just need to search my brain and not necessarily write, i’ve convinced myself that the sound of running water jumpstarts neuron firing. sometimes i listen to waterfall sounds, sounds of the ocean, etc. but they’re for a specific use, &amp; nothing beats “getting ideas organically” (alleged) while in the shower or washing dishes 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, this is hard 🙁 my thoughts, mainly, are that it’s better in theory than in practice. on paper, it’s everything i should love — multimedia, an unreliable narrative, a story that makes you work for it, all under the hands of a writer clearly and proudly in conversation with bachelard’s poetics of space. there’s nothing here for me to hate from the outset, and having engaged with the book several times now in an effort to cement my relationship with it, there’s Still nothing, technically, that i so much as dislike. i’ve never felt more like the encyclopedia volume obsessed kid i was than flipping this book and turning it this way and that in the middle of the night, and i do think that for better or for worse, nothing will be able to easily displace it in conversation around its specific niche of horror. <br><br>nonetheless, i wonder if it’s the most popular within that niche exactly bc it explores yet not doesn’t really contribute to what it emulates/portrays as much as it could be. this isn’t to say that it doesn’t do it at all, but once you strip away everything that might appear novel about it, it is very much a piece of media, evaluated in full, that is defined by its lack more than what it brought to the table. it’s not the first nor will it be the last book that has had multiple narratives layered on top of each other, nor is it particularly special in what readers claim to love about it — that it burrows into your mind and alters your perception of your own reality, that it makes you question things you didn’t before. i can’t say i didn’t find house of leaves fascinating. i still do. but it’s more akin to that one film they put on during a blizzard day at school and everyone else slept through it except for you and two other classmates who were weirdly riveted by this random 80s movie with bad visual effects. the novelty is the strength of its appeal, but the novelty is not substance enough, especially when the questions the book purports to have raised weighs less than a feather. <br><br>i’ll always love the idea of “found” media and its adjacent counterparts, may it be blair witch project or mystery flesh pit national park, and i’m admittedly weak to books like trust by hernan diaz or biography of x by catherine lacey that begin to lean into unreliability through metafiction. i feel some guilt that i can’t bring that same enthusiasm to house of leaves. i do carry attachment to it, and often i entertain the way some readers like to say that the book will be far more interesting if it was only the navidson record part — but i disagree. it’s better for being what it is. it’s just not enough.</div>

 <div class=question>Hey sha! ( I hope it’s fine to ask) I wonder what song Yuuji and Megumi were slaying to in the kitchen ( in Skow), and on the night they broke up, what song they were dancing to? If it is a group of songs, what are they in order? Thank you in advance!</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s no problem at all! i don’t know if i was necessarily thinking of one specific song for the night they broke up, but i do want to point you to we’ll be fine by luz, to whom a lovely person here on cc introduced me while flls was still ongoing. the mahogany sessions version is in the fic playlist around the section for their breakup, but now that i’m rereading my description of the piano that night, the music i’m hearing in my head isn’t anything in particular — i was likely envisioning more of quiet background playing, typical wedding reception fare, that then segues into we’ll be fine. <br><br>in the coda, they’re dancing to harvest moon by neil young. i have the lord huron cover in the playlist bc that’s what i listened to while blocking that kitchen scene in my head and this version has more swing and brass to it, but i like to think they would have actually been listening to the original neil young song (since megumi does wonder if yuuji listens to this kind of music bc it reminds him of his grandpa).</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my goodness, i can’t even imagine reading through the whole collection. it means a lot to know anyone would want to do that, it’s truly no small feat 😭 though i feel like i should say — please don’t feel obligated to go the whole way through, especially since the reads are bound to get rougher the farther back in time you get. i’m grateful and touched enough that you’d read multiple works in some of the tags that i wrote literal hundreds of thousands of words for. above all, i sincerely hope you find something to enjoy in the fics you do give a shot :(<br><br>regarding fics in progress… there are two fics i want to properly sit down to write for honkai: star rail sometime soon, especially now that i’ve already written and banished several other drafts/wips and can tell when i actually want to see a thing through for this world instead of just messing around and seeing what sticks. but it’s more unclear than reliable right now, i’m afraid. certainly enough not to hold out hope for, nor to play through over a year’s worth of gacha game content. <br><br>all i can say rn is if i write anything sometime soon, it will definitely be for h:sr, so please take it easy and read only what you’d like! that means a lot to me as it is, and i’m overjoyed to hear that the jjk and blp works have resonated in some way. i think the blue period fics in particular were some of the most… emotionally involved? introspective? povs? i’ve written. they really challenged me to try a headspace that felt so outside of my comfort zone, haha. so it’s always wonderful to see someone spending time in those small universes. <br><br>thank You for your wonderfully kind words, i also hope you’re taking care, and i really am sorry my ao3 bookmarks aren’t more available/organized !!</div>

 <div class=reply>if only i could give you half an idea how moving it is to know there are people who’d love to walk them down the aisle (in its own way) as much as i do… thank you :( i don’t think i’ll ever write a pairing to such an absolute ending, but at the same time i have full confidence that whatever ship there is to dock has been headed straight for harbour the moment i let the flls boys go. it’s a strange limbo; it’s closure enough for me at the same time. but i’ll miss them forever, and it means more than there are words in the world to know there are readers still keeping this universe alive 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no please by all means honkai-ify my inbox! it’s the only thing that makes me feel light these days and it truly brings me joy to talk about it 🫶🏼<br><br>i… didn’t think i’ll be spending my birthday weeping over a scene where one character talks like mickey mouse but the final cutscene with misha got me far more than i ever could have anticipated. it’s wild bc i didn’t really cry for aventurine’s arc no matter how much it ruined me; that felt sombre and bittersweet, and i was so focused on the meat of the story itself that the sadness of it all didn’t hit me until i was returning to the same locations later on. but the misha &amp; clockie scene all the way to us unlocking the harmony path — enough tears to soak my pillow. then it happened again during the final fight. i’m still flabbergasted. part of it is my weakness for cyclicality in stories or whatever (which — the beautiful irony of clocks and compasses being the motifs of that plot line, only for us to learn that the person and legacy we’re looking for brings us on a perfect loop), but i also just think hsr is pretty economic with the Hero Saves The Day tropes, so when they finally land, they hit me pretty hard. the robin hillsong era track didn’t hurt as well. <br><br>i already forgot whatever i said on twt about the themes of free will and freedom in penacony, but those are probably the obvious ones anyway. i really just enjoy how we find out again and again, whether the topaz arc for belobog or the ghost hunting event, that the path of trailblaze isn’t about being The savior — it’s about giving someone the choice, and standing up for your own definition of what it means to live and survive. 2.2 really dug its claws into that, sometimes a little too outright — firefly &amp; blade’s convo, gallagher’s involvement, the whole debate about whether to cage or leave the bird to live its natural life — but it was lovely to see all the themes they’ve been cooking since the ruan mei-ratio quest finally come together like this. that even a life lived in failure is a life that has triumphed exactly bc it has been lived — and yet, if we could ensure that no one would have to fail at all, wouldn’t we choose the cage? would it be a cage at all?<br><br>if you told me pre-penacony that i’d end it with sunday bypassing everyone else as the character i’m most likely to write about, i would have struggled to imagine that bc his arc seemed the most straightforward to me before we even got to know him. it’s not that he’s more complex than i thought he would be, more so that the execution of his arc came as a pleasant surprise despite its predictability. it’s a shame discussions around him seem to either skew towards He’s Bad Despite The Good vs. He’s Good Despite The Bad. offence or defence. it’s all very stale for such an interesting character. but that’s a separate ramble waiting to happen.<br><br>i just had a fun time! as always! felt like i was chopped up and poured into a blender until i was purée! also as always!</div>

 <div class=reply>as in do i have fics in progress for either of these series? none at all at the moment, i’m sorry to say 🙁 fics in general are highly unlikely for jjk, if maybe not entirely a never… i’ll always have affection for the characters/fics i did write in that world, but i have negative amounts of goodwill to spare that series and truthfully can’t see myself sitting down to write a whole fic for it. i don’t mind talking about jjk or hashing out thoughts/hcs about its characters, but the series ran its course with me. it had its time. <br><br>for blue period, i’m less sure. i wouldn’t be surprised if i dusted off some of the docs i’ve been revisiting in spurts over the last couple of years, yet there’s no real desire there either. i have thoughts and feelings i’d like to write out, but not to the scale of the usual fics i allow to be published, i think. <br><br>i’m sincerely sorry if this is a disappointing answer to receive. fic-writing for me tends to reflect an amount of nagging dissatisfaction with a piece of media and/or a desire to explore what the source material never might, and that usually means that once i get it out of my system, it’s out for good. the chances are never zero that something in an older phase gives me new things to write, but they are quite slim.</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s like. whatever. i don’t find her interesting at all, and i think her choices in both prose and poetry demand a kind of benefit of the doubt from me as a reader that i don’t really enjoy. whatever goodwill i can spare to the nature and tragedy of her life does not extend to her work, and sometimes the boringness of her language even makes me apathetic to whatever inspired them. my feelings toward her were already digging at full speed before her genuinely problematic stances even become the final nail on the coffin. so. you can say it was just never gonna work out between us. <br><br>however, i do also have a notable distaste towards authors/poets whose entire claim to art and craft is their personal lore, and as biased as it is, that gets worse and worse when the same artist has a penchant for self-centrism in their work. idk how else to explain it, but it leads to juvenile art more often than not, and a lot of the time bc the writer gets stuck in this ironic cycle of being infantilized by the disconnect between the depth of their own emotions and the art itself. the result is the bell jar being a young adult novel the same way catcher in the rye is one, but the punchline just happens to be more apparent in one. i think plath would be right at home with the contemporary white woman authors we have now, like sally rooney and emma cline, both of whom i’d even argue have a more potent if not necessarily better voice than plath. this reframes for me both what’s good and what’s lacking in plath’s writing; it’s not bad, if this is the wider canon we’re looking at, but what talent and beauty might be there for me to mine is also deeply, Deeply dull and will never have the chance to blossom. <br><br>there’s a tangent here somewhere about how she has become entrenched in the modern era’s attachment to eternal girlhood for a reason, i.e. i’m just a girl incapable of any adult thoughts, overconsumption defines my feminity, etc. the bell jar encapsulates how there’s a point where all of this begins to ring as a refusal to grow up, and a refusal to think any more critically about your own otherwise valid emotions and mental health. i understand the circumstances that led plath to writing how and what she did based off her personal life, and i know the limits of her work must have been the limits of her worldview, but it remains that, as a writer, there are moments her way of writing about emotion and personal lives comes across as borderline fetishistic. at which point i’d rather just stick with dull. maybe i’m just cold-hearted. <br><br>i’m sure this answer could have been put more delicately if i wasn’t typing it at 5am, and ofc there are people that she speaks to. i acknowledge much of my complaints in fact sustain the appeal of her art. there Are a few lines in some of her poems that i can appreciate objectively, and my feelings against her do not get in the way of that. but you know. give me something here to work with, bc i’m grasping at straws.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh hm. hmmm. so… this isn’t really worth reading but lately i’ve been writing a character who’s never really had anyone to call their own. that in itself should be an archetype i have experience in, but in this particular case it’s gotten very easy for lines to get crossed and for the character to kind of just. see possession/dependence as the only form love can take. <br><br>that should be straightforward enough, but i find that what i’m struggling with is how to make tangible the desire to possess another person out of love. i can see well enough that the reason i struggle to take initiative in my friendships is bc i see my reaching out as an automatic intrusion on their privacy and selfhood, which i’d never want to compromise; i can’t help but think how it would feel in their place, if someone were to intrude upon the carefully delineated marks i’ve drawn between me and the world, and i can’t imagine that being anything except a violent wrong. i know it’s not functional to be so averse to anything that might attack my independence / self-sufficiency / agency / solitude / whatever and potentially take these away after i’ve fought so hard for them, but it’s hard to shake off even when i know friends want me to ease up. it’s even harder to imagine, for the sake of this current project, how it is to love someone enough that you’d (dysfunctionally) want to be their only. for the boundaries against the world to be drawn around you both instead of just you, for example. <br><br>idk if this is making sense. my only point is that between loving someone to such intense degrees AND seeing (mistaking) possession/consumption as love, it’s two things i just. don’t have the brain to understand by nature. that’s what makes it fun to write, something so unknown, and i know it will click eventually, but i just think it’s funny that even a character i’m building from scratch is requiring me to do some mental gymnastics. <br><br>man i kinda feel like... i fell for a trap here. and that i was just supposed to say hi, i hope you have a lovely day, and that may has treated you well. which i would also like to say. this was very sweet of you — thank you for letting me articulate some things that i didn’t think needed unknotting until now, and sorry for actually taking advantage of it to ramble a bit 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh i feel like i’ll be cornered into speculative fiction titles just for the utility of answering these, but i’ll try my best to be more holistic!<br><br>for plot/plot twist, sea of tranquility by emily st. john mandel and piranesi by susanna clarke come to mind. neither are especially intricate/unpredictable “twists” (a term i already use very loosely here), but i think there’s something to be said about seemingly low-stakes sff making those low stakes work for it. i love when sff comes with a little… jolt? i feel like it’s the only genre that knows truly what it means to grab the mirror inside the story and turn it to you, the reader, in a way that makes you think oh! ofc! i’m complicit in the making of all these layers of story buffeted by The Human Condition! i think that’s what a good twist is. not murder of roger ackroyd or the seven husbands of evelyn hugo, but that sense of the story holding its breath and then winking when you help it finally exhale. <br><br>a novel that made me fall in love with a place… i enjoy any kind of location in fiction, even if it’s just hollywood/l.a. in something new under the sun by alexandra kleeman or the seoul we see in kim young-ha’s i hear your voice. but the goldfinch by donna tartt put amsterdam specifically during christmas on a bucket list i didn’t realize i had. i think an underrated part of tartt’s writing are her settings, which at times vastly outperform her capacity to build characters. though this is also the book that gave me boris pavlikovsky, who was an eye opener for me in lots of ways about how even a character that’s mostly archetype — which tartt’s main characters are always guilty of reducing the people around them to — can basically take over a story the way a location can. so. there’s a thought here i can’t connect right now, about the distance that both places and people are relegated to when you have an unreliable narrator.<br><br>top pick for worldbuilding… maybe the dispossessed? i’ve never seen worldbuilding quite like how le guin does it here. not in the details of it — of which there are glossier examples in her short stories/other book series — but the specific… mechanism of how she divulges details and builds the world and people here? there’s like. idk. an ambiguity and cyclicality that i find refreshing. i think sci-fi gets often caught up with being clear and stable with the science part that it forgets the universe is your oyster and you can pull off essentially what magical realism is to hard fantasy (which is fine. i also enjoy liu cixin’s world-building.) but the dispossessed is a world of impossible ideas in conflict, and there’s a sense that all these questions at play can only settle for like. schrodinger’s answer. but how to depict that? le guin somehow manages to do it here. it feels like a magic trick i can’t figure out. <br><br>i am probably forgetting 98% of other books i’ve read, but these are the impulsive answers my brain decided to churn out today 🤲🏼</div>

 <div class=reply>omg the au that spiralled out of a corduroy jacket !! that’s a deep cut whoa… thank you for even thinking to scroll back that far 😭<br><br>but okay! are we talking flls megumi’s wardrobe or canon megumi... bc i think all the canon characters have had some atrocious sartorial choices and refuse to comment on that. flls megumi — and therefore probably architect major au megumi — fares a little bit better bc he’s not trapped in shounen world, and also bc gojo Expensive Dress Shirt satoru would probably normalize for megumi very early that there’s no shame in paying a lot for fashion essentials. which is all that megumi wears anyway. <br><br>i think the coat gojo is mentioned wearing in flls chapter five is valentino lmaooo it was like a little inside joke with myself bc flls megumi probably has a bunch of “designer” clothing items that were a gift from stsg or just. things he thought were normal to get bc for all that gojo and toji are like That, they also have expensive tastes. it kinda horrifies yuuji, who buys his t-shirts in bulk for cheap even after he goes pro.<br><br>i can’t remember what exactly i said about megumi’s jacket collection but i imagine he has:<br><br>— a corduroy jacket with a removable fleece collar<br>— a leather jacket in both black and brown (nobara has stolen each of these for an outfit without him noticing bc he’s gotten teased every time he wears these around friends/nanako &amp; mimiko and has sworn off wearing them again)<br>— a varsity jacket (if strictly flls universe, then i’m sure he’ll eventually have one with yuuji’s jersey number on it, relationship privacy be damned)<br>— a genuine &amp; expensive sukajan that was a gift but that he’s too embarrassed to wear outside (it’s mostly used by this universe’s yuuji)<br>— a classic denim jacket that always makes him second guess what he’s wearing just before he’s out the door, but actually led to him and yuuji wearing accidental matching outfits the one time he didn’t take it off<br>— a black puffer jacket that he only wears twice a season bc it doesn’t ever really get the kind of cold that warrants it<br>— some kind of waterproof barbour jacket?<br>— a navy full-length wool coat that probably costs a month’s rent for an average tokyo dweller, but is the one he uses the most bc it’s just easy and good for all occasions. <br><br>under these are a rotation of cream/beige/navy sweaters, cardigans, turtlenecks and thermal wear. in my mind, he just looks permanently “put together” even when he isn’t bc he uses lint rollers like they’re meant to be used and does actually iron his clothes. you can argue it’s a kind of armor in itself, though he won’t see it that way, but i envision megumi’s wardrobe as just one of those things he maintains through what he feels is the bare minimum purely so it will be one less thing to be out of place. the result is him looking like he cares more about what he wears than he says he does.</div>

 <div class=reply>at fanon…? of political texts? :o i hope i’m not misinterpreting some necessary context here, but please don’t hesitate to send me another message if this isn’t what you’re looking for!<br><br>i suppose it depends on whether you’d like to start with what’s closer to you (maybe you hope to have your own home someday and want to read more about gentrification and the landlord class) or things that you didn’t even realize was happening (the big businesses behind the opioid crisis, maybe, or the jakarta method). i wonder if it might help to start with publishers/publications whose directive is exactly to invite people to explore more? n+1 (https://www.nplusonemag.com/) comes to mind, as well as verso books (https://www.versobooks.com). if you go to verso’s books section, you will find their catalogue divided into subjects, at which point you can decide what you’re willing to explore first. if you look up “reading list” on their site, it should also turn up blog posts that compile reading recommendations depending on what you’re looking for, such as:<br><br>— on palestine’s ongoing struggle for palestinian liberation (there’s a collection of essays here that you can get for free!) https://www.versobooks.com/en-ca/blogs/news/5078-palestinian-solidarity-reading-list <br>— philosophy for when you feel like the world ending https://www.versobooks.com/en-ca/blogs/news/verso-philosophy<br>— reimagining architecture and cities https://www.versobooks.com/en-ca/blogs/news/2478-reimagining-architecture-and-cities-a-reading-list?_pos=2&amp;_sid=21735b094&amp;_ss=r <br><br>(some of verso standouts in recent memory are: females by andrea long chu, the emancipated spectator by jacques rancière, &amp; traces of history by patrick wolfe.) <br><br>in the end — and i know this sounds pedantic — i think nearly all of nonfiction is political, like jenny odell’s how to do nothing or mark fisher’s ghosts of my life or carmen maria machado’s in the dream house. also, as much as academics lead information and discourse, there will always be an added layer involved in learning, and dangers of seeking information from what is essentially an ivory tower. nonfiction isn’t the only way the political seeps into lives — there are podcasts, fiction, and graphic novels that i have learned about politics from as much as i have “proper” texts, and the key here, i think, is to understand that every breath we take is political. academics observe &amp; study, but we all live and exist in a network made possible by the chain of chemical reactions that happen from the history of your own country to your social media platforms. some people will have their eyes opened by books, but listening directly to lived experiences is not insignificant. it’s important to know your political history, and just as important to see the ways it trickles down to the present. <br><br>this is becoming a tangent ahhh i hope this was an okay answer and again i am happy to share non-formal text recs, like specific articles or memoirs, etc.</div>

 <div class=reply>i do want the songs to give more glimpses into flls! 😊 it’s funny, the more time passes, the more i get confused about which parts of that universe i actually did write into flls/skow and which ones are kinda just. there in my head. for background purposes. or maybe i’d hear a song and a part of the flls world i didn’t think about that much before will suddenly gain clarity. the playlist keeps the universe alive in some way, but i guess it also allows certain perspectives that i didn’t have space for during the story itself, like yuuji’s thoughts preceding the breakup, or megumi’s thoughts during the second person pov section of chapter 5. <br><br>as for your questions, though: there Should be a brief mention in the first scene of skow of megumi eating ice cream out on nobara’s balcony after the breakup/tsumiki’s wedding, and i always saw that as being in contrast to how i imagine yuuji, usually surrounded by people, going straight home after the wedding and just. staring into space. he doesn’t cry again, he doesn’t go to nanami, he doesn’t talk to anyone. he just sits there until sunrise. at which point he goes about his normal routine. his morning run, feeding sukuna, his job. the irony of it for me is that it’s yuuji who chooses to weather his heartbreak silently and alone, &amp; him who allegedly returns to a semblance of “normalcy” quicker. he at least knows heartbreak when he sees it, while megumi spends a full month not being able to concentrate and just wanting to tear apart all of his emotions into pieces that make more sense until tsumiki returns from her honeymoon and talks some sense into him. but yuuji just. turns off. maybe bc in some ways the grief of losing someone is familiar. or maybe bc he’ll always feel the responsibility of making megumi say the words the night of their breakup and thinks that this heartbreak is the least he can do for a decision he made. you know. typical flls yuuji thoughts. his compartmentalization/acceptance is as self-destructive as megumi’s frustration.<br><br>another irony (and an echo of their love for each other, at least narratively) is that in those moments they missed each other most after the breakup, they acted more like the other. it’s megumi who learns to throw himself at jobs, at opportunities to be out of the house, while it’s yuuji who learns to distinguish solitude from loneliness. in a way, his post-breakup heartbreak gave him a new threshold for the kind of crappiness he would feel some days anyway, and this time, he knows he can’t in fact weather a hookup or a social event for the sake of it. it’s sad that the breakup was the catalyst to them learning new things about how they cope and feel, bc it meant losing each other was also necessary. <br><br>i am running out of space but. as much as the playlist is keeping the flls universe alive, so are readers like you, and i’m eternally grateful to receive such generosity for this little fictional world ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>cha… is so so sooo cute… like tea 🥹❣️ <br><br>hmmm the cherry blossoms in my city usually bloom the same week as my birthday, and that has done much in the last few years to help me embrace being born in spring. it’s a weird season for me — though aren’t they all? — with something about the general quiet hopefulness of the season and just my natural disposition as a person leading to a lot of internal conflict. or something. but i like the flowers very, very much. i like the way they bloom almost in defiance after heavy rain. spring rain gets really bad in my city… almost angry. so it’s like the flowers are even angrier about their vitality in return. it’s just a very transient season, spring. maybe that’s my favourite thing about it. the transience. the cherry blossoms are only in bloom for a week here. just long enough for me to turn a year older and watch the branches go bare again in its wake. it’s like a little twinge in my chest that reminds me i’m alive, and time has not forgotten.<br><br>tldr: i like that april showers bring may flowers, and that the may flowers are cherry blossoms! i also like the lily of the valleys and bluebells. and thanks to an eternally dear friend, i’m paying closer attention to hellebores this year, too. so. if i can spend the season just drinking tea and reading in a greenhouse (it’s only spring that i try to pick seasonal books to suit the weather best), that would be so lovely.. but a trip to the park to read under the cherry blossoms does the trick just as well 🌸</div>

 <div class=question>hey hello! i don't want to use your askbox as a writing advice slot machine but—how do you feel confident in your dialogue? whenever i write it i always second-guess myself. like, i'm always asking myself, "would i say that in a conversation with someone? would i ever *allow* myself to say this?" and, like, i am never that good on finding an answer. so, like, this is just me wondering if you have any advice / commiseration to offer? i hope you're doing well :,)</div>

 <div class=reply>that’s okay! i can’t promise good answers, is the only catch, but thank you for the courtesy, and i also hope you’re doing well 💌<br><br>with dialogue… well, it’s not about whether You would say it, but whether the character speaking would, right? i know that’s probably obvious, and you might have just phrased the question like that rhetorically, but i think it’s important to bear in mind that everyone speaks differently, and that’s why i’m always wary of using yourself as a frame of reference for your characters. sometimes authors get too much into using dialogue as a mouthpiece, or moving the story along, or fleshing out characters through their words, that the dialogue forgets to be good enough to stand for itself. <br><br>it’s also not often the content itself but the How that matters. anyone can say anything in any given situation, but some people might be more shy about it, or others might exaggerate with words like “super” or “totally.” some characters say things they don’t mean, and That’s how they end up saying what you want them to say — through the lie or the omission or whatever. if you feel a character might not say something but still needs that thing conveyed, you can translate it somewhere else — an expression, a pause, a word choice, body language. if they can’t say something, what’s an analogy they Would make? what are some pop culture references/allusions true to them? with the right pacing, someone fumbling through a confession, just as an example, can be even more earnest and romantic than a direct i love you. dialogue is just one tool in your arsenal, even if its primary directive is to shine a spotlight on interpersonal dynamics. if that spotlight is best sustained by characters failing to say something, then that’s the best choice for dialogue. if that makes sense. <br><br>maybe the question isn’t whether they’d say it or not but whether they would say it Like This — and it’s the job of a writer to sell the reader on why the answer is yes. i’m just yapping now, though. i’m not sure if any of this counts as advice and can only hope at least one thing is coherent, but !! all the best of luck with your writing endeavours !!</div>

 <div class=question>Hi! I hope you’re well &lt;3 Recently I’ve been trying to get back into writing because I used to enjoy it a lot, and I have a lot of fanfic ideas I’ve half-written and thought about that I really want to do something with, but I keep getting stuck in this fear that I won’t be able to do them justice? Like, I know it’s just fanfic but I want the story to be good and satisfying and I feel like I’m just so out of practice that I get frustrated before I even start and it hasn’t gotten me anywhere. I know it’s probably just my perfectionist tendencies getting the better of me, but it has me pendulum swinging between “you won’t know until you try” and “maybe this means I’m just not cut out to be a writer” and idk, it’s just making me feel weird and self-conscious about my skills and creativity :/ have you ever felt like this before? I’m curious to hear your thoughts and any advice you might have, if that’s okay. If you feel so inclined to share, thank you! If not, that’s okay too. I hope your projects are going well &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhh…. i think it’s important to separate perfectionism from fear, first off. i know it must seem like pure semantics, but i like to remind myself that we only get the privilege to be perfectionistic when there’s something To perfect. it’s not perfectionism when you haven’t done anything yet; it’s just fear, which is much easier to push past but far harder to notice. one helps the writing; the other does not. <br><br>there’s nothing wrong at all with being scared, but at the same time, fear shouldn’t be mutually exclusive from writing. if you must, write scared. write disgusted. write insecure. write a first draft you hate then tear it apart once it’s done. i laugh at the stuff i write as i’m writing them bc i can’t believe the garbage i’m typing, then i laugh some more as i edit bc i can’t believe the garbage i’m keeping. it’s the best. that perpetual state of disbelief is what writing is to me — that at the end of the day there is enough for me to hack off during the editing stage to make something that looks as if it has looked like this from the beginning. writing is an art form that reveals itself only through failure. oil painters add and subtract, songwriters restructure and replace, but writing above all needs to know what it shouldn’t be before it can truly embrace what it should be. you haven’t even given your writing what it shouldn’t be, my friend. <br><br>it’s normal to feel like you’re not cut out for writing. it’s like an exhausting vow you have to renew every time you finish and restart. you don’t need to Not doubt to be a writer, but you can also do the doubting another time. write things you feel like crap about, then ask yourself why you feel crap about it — there’s merit in that. it teaches you what not to do. until the first drafts gets cleaner and cleaner, until you can open a doc and just start writing bc you’ve done this so many times and failed and hacked away at a first draft just as many times. even failure is a valuable resource — why turn it down? if writing is that big of a deal to you, if perfection is really what it’s about, why not endure mistakes and potential failure for its sake? <br><br>at least that’s how i like to think of it, but i know i can be extreme. i also really hope i don’t sound too harsh. i mean this all with as much tenderness as i can muster. i understand the impulse here; i’ve heard it a lot, and know for a fact you’re not alone. i know even better that imagining a good and satisfying ending is much easier to do when there are things to move around and poke at. do you look at a pile of puzzle pieces berating yourself for not being able to pick them out in clockwise order? i hope not. the more pieces you lay out in random corners, the clearer the sum of these parts appears. writing is no different. let yourself collect pieces that frustrate and confound you. they’re kind of necessary to the end result. <br><br>i’m sorry if this just ended up more burdensome than helpful, but i do hope things work out for the best.</div>

 <div class=reply>no, no, i empathize here so much… it feels like the whole world is having trouble with memory, and i wonder often if we’re living in such an unprecedented era of constant floods of information that the collective memory impairment of the earliest pandemic years has just. fried our neurons past the point of no return.<br><br>i think of remembering as handing a certain experience or piece of info to my little brain librarian, who commands an army of archivists in keeping memories safe until i drop by and ask for something. the problem now is that our memories don’t even reach the library—they’re not encoded. our little brain librarians are hanging around listless and jobless, bc we’ve fired all the postal workers that deliver the memories. unfortunately &amp; truthfully, i don’t know how to fix that old system. but i’ve found there are ways to drive memories over more manually, so to speak. encoding is the key part in memory, and what we struggle with when we do or don’t remember things; we don’t forget that which has already survived encoding, even if it might slip our mind. lists and timed calendar reminders are especially useful for me, as well as anchoring bullet points in my mind to physical objects around me as a trigger for the remembering. kinda like moving into the next room, forgetting what you came to get, and being able to retrace my steps and re-trigger the thought when i see this plant. that logic is just applied more widely. the brain is very susceptible to tactile/physical/external things like that. <br><br>for traditional learning, blunt repetition is the method that has worked the best for me. i keep a notebook where i scrawl paradigms and charts or even the same word over and over again. there’s science somewhere supporting that if you take your body through handwriting motions as you’re trying to remember something, even if you’re not aware of what you’re writing — it can even just be circles — your brain will take that as a sign to encode it. it will be handy to know your learning style and to remember that the key to consolidating memory is to (re)consolidate it until you can’t anymore, to batter yourself over the head with an image, a word, an audio until it sticks. <br><br>ultimately, though, memories have never been fixed, permanent, or even consistently true. that fact hasn’t changed just bc it’s even harder to access memory now. hell, i don’t even think the state of the world is solely responsible for My own gaps in memory and difficulty remembering things. to quote sebald, “the older you get, in a sense, the more you forget. vast tracts of your life sort of vanish in oblivion.” it’s kinda just. what we live with. and it’s frustrating that it’s even worse for our generations, but when you do try to brute-force your body to remember, “that which survives in your mind acquires a very considerable degree of density.” i think that makes it worth the effort, though i am very sorry i can’t offer more applicable advice.</div>

 <div class=reply>you’re entirely justified for that though 🙂‍↕️ i mean. dead poets society… is a movie i enjoyed watching. sure. i may not have generous things to say about its quality as a film, but i think it’s pretty and heartfelt — though not always successfully — and baby ethan hawke doing the sweaty-toothed madman moment was an early lesson for me in managing the energy of a scene. however. it’s everything that dark academia is not, and you can even argue that’s why its central thesis fails to argue for itself. it’s closer in spirit to the holdovers and maybe foster dade explores the cosmos than tsh. that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. <br><br>people need to learn the difference between dark academia and just a piece of media that could have been set in any new england high school. or any campus built before 1990. what are we doing here. is the mise en scene the definer of a genre now. synecdoche new york and frances ha are both set in nyc and they can’t be more different. i went to an ontario uni scrawling latin inside buildings that overlooked deer crossing snow-covered meadows, and it still wasn’t tsh-y any more than dead poets society is. let’s get a grip here, people.<br><br>maybe we’re all just in a massive tartt withdrawal stage. what is taking so long, donna. please. respectfully.</div>

 <div class=reply>just between you and me, i was guilty of the exact same thing when i was writing flls 😓 itafushikugi’s voice actors had this... podcast? radio show? and i would listen to it while getting into The Mood of writing dialogue, to kinda nail down descriptions of their voices without getting distracted by their linguistic mannerisms and tonal preferences when they’re in character. then it started feeling weird bc enoki junya especially sounds so much like yuuji sometimes even outside of a role — but anyway. not the point of this message. thank you sincerely for sharing this with me. it’s really, really moving and surreal to hear flls can have a lasting after-image like this for someone else, and that those characters felt as (briefly) alive for you as they did for me writing it — though i also hope it has released you by now! i know uchida yuuma especially is in quite a few other fun shows! that’s a lot to miss out on for me as well!</div>

 <div class=question>omg im the one that asked abt ohshc AND I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY… it’s one of my comfort shows and aghhh! you’re so rigjt about the anime itself holding so much… so much—?! there’s so much care in each character and it’s one of those shows where i miss so entirely but am thankful that there’s no s2 or anything. i feel like that’d only ruin its impact. the sound tracks always pull something aching and gentle in me. and the ending being “we’ll see you in music room 3” really broke my heart in such a kind way. idk. i know it hasnt aged well like u said but it still holds such a special place in my heart. it’s so nice knowing others share that feeling too :)<br>also, while i’m here, how do you feel about tamaki and haruhi being endgame? the author originally intended foe haruhi to end up with mori, and i see people upset abt them not happening, but i personally like how tamaki and haruhi balance each other out. i think they complement each other well.. what do u think? &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m thankful there’s no s2 as well 🧎🏽 i feel like both the manga and the anime are stronger as they are like this, even and especially in the points where they diverge. there’s just something about the anime that feels like a time capsule — it’s a snapshot of one year with the host club, across which we got to know them a little bit and saw glimpses into their lives and fears and insecurities and complexities, but at the end of the day, it’s also a chaotic friend group with unbreakable ties getting into capital s Shenanigans and tugging at the knots that connect them to each other even when it looks like they might pull taut or strain. <br><br>that line from the raven cycle that’s like, “in that moment, blue was a little in love with all of them. their magic, their quest, their awfulness and strangeness. her raven boys.” is the ohshc anime in a nutshell exactly bc it didn’t have to choose or narrow down its focus in the same way the manga did. if that makes sense. it’s heartfelt exactly bc it didn’t have room to be more. it’s more a found family story, and the love possible between chosen loved ones, than a traditional one-on-one romance. that alone makes it timeless. <br><br>believing that, i don’t really have strong feelings about who haruhi ended up with? i was so surprised to hear from someone online that mori was the original endgame. i’ve always kinda felt like what haruhi actually fell in love with (at least at first) was the host club as a whole, and the beating heart of the host club, the personification that everyone else was also in love with in their own ways, was tamaki. haruhi/tamaki made sense from a thematic standpoint, but i can’t say i’m super into their romantic chemistry. i’m not against it at all, either. it’s kinda just. the endgame that you always knew was inevitable. it brings me the same joy-sadness as the ending of the anime. or like — you know the halloween episode where kaoru’s watching hikaru &amp; haruhi wall away and he muses that ah, this is it. this is the beginning of the moment where the carriage turns back into a pumpkin. this is where the magic that enveloped all of us, together, will have to choose two people above all. you don’t resent that for happening bc of course it will happen, but there’s a bittersweetness to how right it is. i do agree that tamaki &amp; haruhi balance each other out, but more than anything, they were the two who loved the club and were loved by them in turn the hardest — not the best, just the hardest — and the love that circulated throughout all of them would have no other finish line to settle on that them two ending up with each other. like that quote from mike flanagan’s haunting of hill house: “i loved you completely. and you loved me the same. that’s all. the rest is confetti.” that’s it. that’s ouran the series, and i feel like it’s just embodied in tamaki &amp; haruhi.</div>

 <div class=reply>as in skylar/cirrus lost in the cloud? if so, then yes, i have. i’ve read the first two seasons, and some raws of a couple chapters in season three. it’s… well. it’s alright. i’m not enthusiastic about it, though not necessarily out of dislike. it’s more that i’m ambivalent to the story as a whole, and that ambivalence is what surprises me...? you’ve got characters that appear to be morally complex, a healthy mix of relatable elements and genuine explorations of middle school &amp; family trauma, a relationship that has to fight their way into even ground — the parts are all there, and on paper, i should love it. yet i don’t really care one way or the other about what happens to anyone; i’m just reading and going with the flow. <br><br>maybe it’s partly bc the art and pacing veer a bit into a level of melodramatic-izing that edges on rough sometimes, even as i acknowledge and appreciate how the topics and trauma it explores try to remain realistic and grounded. it makes sense, i see the vision, the artist is enormously talented, and i loved the art for the story outside of the manhwa itself, but it just doesn’t work for me alongside the narrative. <br><br>as far as all the elements go, it was a lot of gold pieces that didn’t mesh well altogether, imo. lots of potentially interesting stuff, but a bunch of fancy jewelry won’t necessarily look perfect by default layered on top of each other. i think cirrus is a character that the story intends to portray well and with nuance; it just didn’t stick the landing for me. even in objectively heartbreaking backstory explorations and arguably complex but relatable interpersonal choices, my general feeling was just like “........okay.” which isn’t really fair. it’s just a surprising amount of disconnect with plotlines and characters that i would find compelling otherwise, which probably reflects more on me than the story, but cheers to the people that find something in it to love.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, my friend, i am a serial non-finisher of things myself 🤕<br><br>i do think it depends on the reason, though! sometimes my attention span just doesn’t wanna work with me, and that’s not really a good thing when the desire to finish it is there otherwise; for me, that means i have to switch my approach, whether through reading in smaller chunks or finding something else to read as like… a reward book, almost. as much as it feels really great to experience media that feels uniquely and seamlessly made for you, that just won’t be true for most of them. you have to be open to something as much as it should meet you halfway, and often that’s not really possible for whatever reason. if the incompatibility feels insurmountable at the moment, then i don’t think there’s any shame at all in just putting the book down for now. there will likely come a point when that won’t be true anymore. the book isn’t gonna go anywhere. the best books i’ve read, i only read once i let myself revisit it at a later time knowing the first (or second, or tenth) go-around wasn’t the best time for it. <br><br>all this said, i’m just a firm believer that there is a right moment for certain media, may that be books or films or whatever, and that there’s no use forcing it if right now doesn’t feel like that right moment. my moods and interests are so mutable, and i change my mind and engineer new thoughts about so many areas that if anything, i just take it for granted that there Will be a right time for every possible thing, even the books that i feel like i’ll never ever read. so. life IS too short, but life is also in constant flow. that means there’s never a good enough reason not to reach (or search) for a book that calls to you, even if it means abandoning the one that doesn’t.</div>

 <div class=reply>i promise i’m saying this with the proper amount of gravitas &amp; self-awareness, but it’s the only anime i can probably quote by heart, for better or for worse, and i can’t even tell you why. i have no idea. it’s the only anime i’ve watched more than ten times. singlehandedly taught me that one mozart sonata as a kid, resolved all my gender conflict before they could even arise, probably even aided the development of my class consciousness for all i know. also the only anime i’ve watched enough times in sub and dub that the characters are both vas at the same time in my mind. none of this is an exaggeration. i wish at least one thing was 😭 <br><br>you can argue it went to the glee school of weirdly progressive but did not age well, but it just hasn’t budged as that one anime that grows more and more heartwrenching to me the older i get with each rewatch. this isn’t even a quality that the manga possesses; it’s about the anime alone, specifically, and it’s not shared by anything else from that era of shoujo. makes me wanna yank my heart out so i can study why it’s doing what it is. sickening. whatever That vibe is, only ohshc has been able to deliver it to me. the greatest friendships of my life replenish their nostalgia fuel partly thanks to inside jokes about fancy tuna and instant coffee. also — fujioka haruhi, beloved of all beloveds until the end of time. <br><br>you didn’t ask but my fav episodes are the flashback ones (the door the twins opened + and so kyoya met him) and kyoya’s reluctant day out. i have specific all-time fav scenes from each. but i usually do just rewatch in entire batches. the ones i Have watched more than others aside from those three eps are probably the newspaper club episode and the twins fight, for no particular reason other than 5 and 14 are easy numbers to pick when choosing at random.</div>

 <div class=question>hellooo do you have any fanfic reccs? i’ll read almost everything but i’m currently suffering from hsr rot so if you have any fics in that category i’ll appreciate it very much 😓<br><br>been very hard for me recently to find something that makes me sort of. not sure of the right word for it but i guess this feeling where it stays with you for a while even days after you’ve completed it. whether that be a positive or a negative thing is up to fate, i suppose! but anyway. i really do mean anything. ❣️</div>

 <div class=reply>say no more ✋🏽 i cannot promise they’ll scratch the itch for you, but these certainly did for me: <br><br>— this blade fic (https://ao3.org/works/49867900) is a heartwrenching study in what it means to truly live/be alive, to pay for sins when there’s no one left to collect them &amp; what that means for those you wronged, to find a family in the ashes of the one that fell apart — among other luofu themes. i enjoy what this did with the stellaron hunters, especially kafblade’s dynamic, and the brief interactions we get with the astral express. quiet, contemplative, yet fittingly raw like an open wound that will never heal.<br><br>— the ratio &amp; aventurine tag has understandably gone through several identity crises and is still figuring out the dynamic to settle on after everything in like. the last three patches. but while this ratio &amp; aventurine study (https://ao3.org/works/54111646) is not nearly as easy to slot into the canon timeline/history after 2.1, it’s still an interesting and refreshingly nuanced deep dive into ratio’s complex idealism vs. aventurine’s complex cynicism. also features my fav opening scene of any fic, probably. this, on the other hand, is closer to the softer, more vulnerable aventurine of 2.1: https://ao3.org/works/53708335. different facets of the same character explored, and through different perspectives altogether. <br><br>— then here’s a yx df jy fic that made me laugh out loud but also take several breaks to regain my composure once the hcq feelings caught up: https://ao3.org/works/50417113. it purports to be about xingyue figuring out their sex life, but it’s just a wonderful, perfect, heartbreaking chronicle of the many dynamics within the hcq, including explorations of dan feng’s longing for freedom, how it must have felt to witness yingxing &amp; jing yuan growing older, the mortal-immortal quandary of xingyue, even the quieter love and innate understanding between jingliu &amp; dan feng. so much love between five people, and yes, it wasn’t enough. there’s merit in the fics that explore how not enough it was. but god, was there so much love.<br><br>i’ll refrain from mentioning some rtrn / acheswan / hcq fics that might have some super intense content warnings, but i do want to add that i just enjoy izabellwit’s other genfics for hsr; they make me love this game even more than i already do. anything is a study when you write a character right, and that’s doubly true with hsr. <br><br>lastly, here are some au fics where you don’t need to have read the source material, bc i think they comprise their own fully realized world all on their own merit:<br><br>— a suburban neighbourhood slice of life story, for jjba https://ao3.org/works/5490503<br>— a fake dating high school story with so light a heart it floats, for les mis: https://ao3.org/works/2306315<br>— this (https://ao3.org/works/8498344) and this (https://ao3.org/works/9675044) by my fav vld author. two universes i still sometimes think about to this day, even when i don’t the au they were for. mwah.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha 🤩!! i have gone down the rabbit hole and read so many of your answers...🙈 anyway i had no idea that you were working on a manuscript!! that is so amazing, and i am definitely going to follow-up with that and read anything you write bc honestly it's been awhile since i've been so moved by someone's prose and the way you manipulate words to bend to your will (you're like a word-bender! if they existed in a:tla 😂). i found you through so it goes (bc my heart is with rnbc ♥️) but i was fortunate enough to discover hairpin turns, which made me fall in love with the bcrnis dynamic as a trio, which i think is so difficult to balance and fully explore in a meaningful way, but you somehow managed to do!! ugh i have to really sit down and write a long comment for both fics to fully express my thoughts for them--truly one of the seven wonders of the world 😭. (ps: also absolutely obsessed with ur characterization of sae...i have a really hard time grasping his character and sometimes i read fics that lean toward the "itachi-sasuke" dynamic and others that make sae a lot more ruthless...) <br>my question for you is: i'm so curious about your thoughts on the specific rs for each of the triangle of bcrnis, and why you feel so drawn to rnbc in particular as a stand-alone rs compared to the other two? i'm so curious to understand your thoughts on the dynamic, and why you chose to write so it goes after hairpin turns!! also would love to hear your reflections on so it goes (your round-ups on tumblr-style) HAHA!!! you're spectacular 🤩</div>

 <div class=reply>you are so, so sweet, thank you so much for reading my work and for responding with so much enthusiasm :( oh man. i didn’t expect this round of cc replies to have anything related to writing so this is. a wonderful surprise. thank you very much. <br><br>hehe i do think sae is ruthless, but mostly i feel like he just doesn’t give a fuck 😭 people seem to interpret him taking pleasure in being a cold asshole, but i’ve always felt that he’s simpler in his themes &amp; motivations, in the same way rin is a straightforward character exactly bc it’s so batshit insane that he’s the way he is. if anything, what’s so fun in the itoshis’ dynamic is rin’s volatility and his justified sense of abandonment. they’re a classic case of “am i my brother’s keeper?” no, sae says. yet rin pursues soccer bc of him, yet he’s a shadow that looms over the places that rin’s meant to learn to fill out himself. rin so badly wants to be sae bc he believes the only person sae loves most is himself; he doesn’t realize that even sae thinks that’s not something he should want at all. <br><br>that said, idk if it was so much that i’m necessarily drawn to rnbc over rnbcis, though i love them both intensely, or just the fact that rin just had more for me to dig into than isagi or bachira. there’s a level you reach in rnis that just feels like straining against good/interesting characterization, while bcis isn’t the kind of pairing you write for bc they are what they are, in canon and beyond. isagi is also an especially relational character — everything is prompted in him through external means, and he is in motion the most around and with other characters — while bachira is one of the only bllk characters with a complete arc. there’s room to adapt new avenues of exploration in an au like hairpin turns, but in the canon universe, i thought rnbc specifically had a vision i could follow clearly from current canon to the far future. once i thought to myself that bachira would see rin in guernica, it felt like i Had to try that scene. that just ended up taking 60k+ words sdjsks<br> <br>i can’t take much credit at all for my canonverse fics honestly !! they’re like following a branching path that might not show up on a gps app, yet it leads you down a well-traveled road anyway. the so it goes premise is luckily just my ideal ending for rin; it would be my choice in addressing all his themes and dynamics in one fell swoop. everything i needed, rnbc already had, from their parallels to their individual relationships with isagi to how their weaknesses are made starker by how it’s a strength on the other. i just put it into words, and embellished it with dynamics i wanted to see more of, like sae &amp; bachira’s and rin &amp; karasu’s. it was so much fun, so i’m always beyond touched to hear there are people like you who also enjoyed the fic 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oh! my fav rtrn thing right now is how well they actually work together? it makes sense to know now that penacony was far from their first mission together; if we’re to assume the final victor light cone was their first ever partnership, &amp; that ratio had been aventurine’s partner of choice for a variety of other missions since, then yeah, ofc they know how the other operates and were well within their rights to berate the other for potentially jeopardizing the mission. (e.g. ratio disapproving of aventurine actively endangering himself in leaving the cornerstone vulnerable, &amp; aventurine telling ratio off for following him when sunday could still be watching. ofc ratio knows that aventurine is too ready to use himself as a bargaining chip, and ofc aventurine knows ratio is too observant — and too kind — to not throw away the plan should aventurine so wish.) <br><br>their history also explains the way aventurine seems to adore ratio with this kind of boyish wonder while openly relying on him as well. (in case you missed the quest step descriptions like i did: https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1bwadzy/if_you_didnt_read_the_quest_step_descriptions_in/) i wish we had more of their pre-penacony missions &amp; relationship. aventurine seems to feel safe around ratio both as a person and as a coworker, and they don’t need to show us what led to the amount of knowing that allowed the mind games they were playing With each other in 2.1, but. it intrigues me. esp the conversations they must have had knowing aventurine will have to die for this operation (that ratio is in charge of) to be successful. <br><br>i know aventurine + food is a common topic of exploration in rtrn fics; i do believe he has at least the roman roy habit of ordering indulgent food/drinks, taking a few bites/sips, then passing it over to ratio (which has been Kinda supported by some of the anniversary art). it was nice in 2.1 to see ratio being ordered around, and i can see a latent tendency to spoil aventurine, but i imagine he has some bad habits of his own, like refusing to “indulge in unhealthy food” or staying up late to mark papers despite lecturing about the importance of sleep. <br><br>i thought once that the number of explicit fics in the rtrn tag belies how many are studies on sex after trauma and/or an awful history with intimacy — but i think that applies to nearly everything in rtrn. ratio’s older and has a far kinder worldview, but he’s also often naive &amp; stubborn about his routines. aventurine is flexible to a fault, has trouble conceiving of things as his own, &amp; has a million habits that allowed him to survive but aren’t self preserving in any capacity beyond that. the fun of rtrn is that against all odds and attempts otherwise, the other makes them care and shows them what it means To care. there’s a looooot there to explore with their respective backgrounds in mind. <br><br>i am. out of space. but i am saluting your rtrn endeavours !!</div>

 <div class=reply>i wish i had an answer for this one, sweet stranger, but unfortunately i’m on the same boat and might genuinely go cliff-jumping this month just to see if that will do anything to the ennui. <br><br>as for more “practical” stuff, though… i have notifications disabled, and have screen time locks on nearly all my apps. if it’s “important” stuff like emails or messages, i have them on time summary notif bundles. i leave space for urgent calls by adjusting my do not disturb settings accordingly. but basically just. anything to ensure my phone is as unusable as possible. it doesn’t have to be so drastic 24/7; it’s the first few weeks of a routine that are crucial, bc my body needs the reminder that no, it’s actually not okay to have the attention span and memory of a goldfish. there’s something deeply, deeply wrong if i remain this way, and i can be bored and unmotivated but i can’t be incompetent at the basic requirements of being a person. i refuse to. no matter how painful it is otherwise, i think it would really kill me if someone were able to say that i’m too afflicted with internet brainrot to be a functional person. like that’s it. i’m done. the idea alone is enough to motivate me into actually inventing things to be productive about. <br><br>but it’s also a routine that has been tailored to me and my own inner workings, and i don’t think… it can really help anyone. i don’t even think it’s helping me. it’s just that the more unreachable i am, the more i feel like a person, and the more i feel like a person, the readier i am to do things For that person. for myself. it’s probably pretty fucked to have to imagine yourself as a person you work for, and it doesn’t directly get rid of the boredom or lack of motivation, but it gives me things to do that can amount to some semblance of living. i find hobbies i’m not really all that good at, ones that i won’t be tempted into making into a job. like a mobile game or building mechanical keyboards. i give myself stern scoldings when i feel i need it, bc i feel like if i don’t, no one else will. people tend to say that there’s never been anyone harder on me than i am on myself, and i know it’s not always healthy, but it’s the reason i’m alive. sometimes inventing things to do is the only reason i even experience a day at all. you have to scavenge for the parts to build your life with.<br><br>idk. nothing is a bad thing to do as long as you’re not doing it mindlessly. whether it’s watching movies or scrolling through videos, mindlessness is a default setting that will grow to be a virus in your system. it’s easy, it chooses you more than you choose it, but it will leave you rotting from the inside out to be mindless about anything except love. everything deserves to have you fully present, and especially your life. but i also know that’s easier said than done. i know it is for me. i’m truly sorry i can’t offer more coherent and actionable advice.</div>

 <div class=reply>hmm… listen. i’m also not very forgiving to myself when i’ve been emotionally intense; it’s rare that i let my outbursts get the best of me, so when it happens, it’s something i want to brutally beat myself up over. i see it as a vulnerability. kinda like. don’t let them have emotions so alive, so intense, so singular, bc who knows how that can warp how people see you and what they’re willing to do to or around you. it’s kind of a point of shame for me, to not retain some composure. it’s embarrassing when i lose it even a little. all of which i only bring up bc i have to assume why you’re asking, and it’s bc of this that i do genuinely want to say… there’s nothing wrong with intense emotions? <br><br>or rather, i think there’s a difference between intense emotions &amp; intense reactions. intense emotions are their own kind of logic/rationale; you feel them for a reason, even (or especially) when the intensity is ramped up by — whatever. hormones. brain chemicals. it sucks to feel it, but i consider emotions like any other physiological phenomenon. you will feel sadness or joy in the way you might feel cold, or hungry, or tired. why try to downplay them when they’re a sign your body needs to return to some sort of equilibrium? whether it’s finding the right kind of socializing to counteract any intense loneliness, or troubleshooting for why you’re always quick to anger around a specific person — emotions are not an issue that’s addressed by just cutting down the quantity. even if you stop feeling the thing so intensely, you’ll still keep feeling it somehow, until they pile up, until it’s a big emotion once again, and you’re back at square one.<br><br>that said, i understand intense Reactions can make certain relationships tricky. with those, i personally just. like to cool off. the things i’m capable of doing and saying when i’m angry are often things that wouldn’t be productive were i to act on them. physical activity has been the easiest and surest way. that sounds silly. but. there’s only so long a body can retain an “emotion” that’s actually a reaction (i think 45mins is the human body’s usual max?), and if you can walk/scream at nothing/punch your pillow it out within that time frame, you’ll have a higher chance of finding your way back to a clearer mind.<br><br>in absolute fairness, i don’t know the context of your question, and can only say so much from my own perspective, but my main thoughts are just that intense emotions are a person by person thing. beyond learning to figure out if it’s an emotion or a reaction, there’s only so much someone can do to “not feel” certain things intensely. we’re all better off finding a way to work with how we work than to stamp it down. that’s how people end up blowing things up, literally and metaphorically. journaling doesn’t work for everyone; neither does walking. but you gotta give the right things the right kind of attention. there’s no shortcut out of whatever that means for you. i think.</div>

 <div class=reply>my thoughts are that i need to be shut down and restarted so that my system can stop overheating every time i think about what just happened. i think i answered smth a couple months ago talking about my interest in aventurine after the topaz quest, and it’s kinda hilarious how much more bravado i had then compared to how being in the dewlight pavilion like normal now feels like having my insides broiled 🧎🏻<br><br>here’s a similar answer on the quest / aventurine if you’d be interested in other thoughts https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1349617296<br><br>i was honestly a bit wary about this quest going into it bc it was so easy… to make it… too much? not excessively sad or excessively tragic, bc that shouldn’t be possible, but there was a readily available way for them to be ineffectively heavy-handed about his background, motivations &amp; relationships if they just pressed a little too hard on any part of him. it could have easily been a narrative more interested in indulging the tragedy of his life, or a narrative that goes so hard on the nooo don’t kys without earning it that it circles back around and flattens aventurine into a caricature of who he could have been. but it wasn’t either of that. i do think right now that it was all well-done: his mix of anger and resignation at his fate, his resentment of the world clashing with his inward self-hatred, his defiance of fate and yet his reliance on fate being a higher power in a life that has never truly been his. there’s also some genuine work done on the portrayal of trauma, i felt. it was like. ah. i see you know what you’re doing. my bad for being too apprehensive.<br><br>but whatever here’s someone who has already articulated it better than i am trying to here: https://x.com/venti_later/status/1773364129308225937?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw <br><br>also i think i seriously Was prepared for the worst to come, and to honour whatever decisions he/we will have to make, but what hit me out of left field was having to play in his pov and doing the whole mission with ratio before any of the plot-heavy stuff happened. just seeing/hearing him at work, having normal conversations about whether it’s a nightingale or an eagle, yelling and telling ratio to hurry up, his honest hurt after all of that. i played the quest in english bc i trusted his en voice actor specifically, and i’m glad i did. it feels like the story understood what it had to do for us to be in aventurine’s shoes, truly, and for someone to be equipped with the tools to understand him even if you still somehow don’t give a shit about him after this. i was worried he’ll be written as an easy, half-hearted sympathy check, but there’s a sincere relationship formed between the story and the player in this story, and it was almost heartbreakingly nice. i loved how… quiet? it all was? fragile, but quiet. and real. so i need to suffocate myself with fifty pillows.</div>

 <div class=reply>sarah dessen !! she has been my go-to guilty pleasure / cheesy break author since i was like twelve and the crown has not so much as slid a millimetre off her head. all her characters are a white teenage girl with an interesting name and a difficult family history, living in idyllic locales as they process falling in love and coming of age with their respective emotional baggage. everything is neatly addressed, the formula is always the exact same, archetypes cycle in and out, but it’s also to do dessen a disservice for me to deny that she’s basically on par with salinger in the kind of stories that teenage me thought they’d be writing forever. <br><br>i should say that some of her books are technically “heavy” as well: just listen deals with sa, dreamland features an abusive relationship, lock and key has a romantic interest with an abusive family and a story that features the dichotomy of life in poverty and addiction vs. the utopia of wealthy suburbia. just to name a couple. but the books don’t really seem all that interested in engaging with them with any real depth? it’s like this odd middle ground of unapologetically realistic about the many lives teenagers can lead, but unable to come at it from any lens except the same one that practically all the heroines return to… which is just. a light-hearted, hopeful, all’s well that ends well life where they’re safe, loved by an interesting boyfriend, and no longer haunted by their overarching problems. for the most part. <br><br>i do genuinely love these books, though. like unironically. i kinda admire her ability to use the exact same formula every time yet somehow invent two characters that feel distinct to the book they lead. my personal favourites are along for the ride and the truth about forever; auden and macy are my two fav dessen heroines, and i enjoy the settings and motifs of each book. one added bonus of her work is also that there are easter eggs 😭 you often run into characters/couples from her other books, sometimes even items like the key necklace and social media website from lock and key, and there’s a recurring joke across all the books of hating a band called spinnerbait. it’s the cheesiest goddamn thing. and therefore so so So reliable when you need exactly what the brain-hum neutrality of these stories offer.</div>

 <div class=reply>i feel like the medieval torture feel would feel pretty good right now. like. i need to be stretched out so i stop feeling this cold hard lump inside the core of my being or whatever. that’s how i’m feeling. <br><br>i seriously thought i’d be at least semi-alright. i was like. okay. we have an idea of what to expect from aventurine’s story, i know ratio, sunday, gallagher &amp; acheron will all surprise me one way or another, i know i’ll come out of this quest feeling all out of sorts. i had hopes about how things will end, and certain expectations about how all of it will go down. but you know how people say spoilers don’t matter if a story is confidently told? even when you know what will happen, the execution of it, when done right, takes you by the neck in a way you can’t parry against, and it holds on until you’re out of breath. that’s literally what the anniversary patch did to me. it still has a boot on the back of my neck. gravel is digging into my cheek. i would like to get up.<br><br>i didn’t need 2.1 to exceed my expectations — i would have probably been chill with anything bc i mean look at me i’m a luofu enjoyer — so i’m just partly in shock that they did. there’s so many complex characters in hsr in terms of motivations and backstory and desires, and even lovers of certain characters can’t resist the impulse to flatten and over-moralize. which. come on. nearly everyone in the game has been called insane by another character; they kill, abandon, make morally unjustifiable choices, fail, reject, prioritize themselves, deny their own feelings and others’. i love that aventurine is all the most compelling parts of the cast in one character, and that they went all in on his story in a way we can only do in fragments for other characters with their own complicated histories and motivations. <br><br>i’ve also… felt that fandom portrayals of aventurine don’t often do justice to how scrappy and defiant he is on top of the self-hatred and lack of self-preservation. he hates himself, yes (the one mission description where his thought process about himself was just “failure discarded selfish useless pointless coward murderer gambler blessed discarded loser chosen-one mother goddess’s beloved crazy murderer” over and over again… jesus), but he also takes some pride in challenging the “luck” that has allowed him to survive. the choice to keep living has never truly been his, or at least he has forsaken his right/privilege to decide in multiple ways, and i don’t think he realized whether it’s life or death he’d truly prefer until this mission. until ratio’s letter and the final conversation with the young kakavasha, even. <br><br>he’s just. such a clearly drawn character in a nicely established arc of the story. much more than i ever expected. i’m sure i’ll find feel some way or another about how it was handled once i can look at the whole arc objectively, but for now, i really need that torture wheel.</div>

 <div class=reply>ahh…. while this is a mystery that can be easily solved with a little clicking around, far be it from me to discourage any ideas you might prefer about how i appear, haha. i will say that the only shock people have seemed to encounter when meeting me face to face for the first time after primarily virtual interactions is my height; i guess there’s never any way to prepare people for someone quite a bit below where their usual sight line is. which has nothing to do with my writing or even your mind’s concept of me. so. all this to say i hope your version of me, different as i am sure they must be, is more up to par than i suspect the real me is 🚶🏻</div>

 <div class=reply>i do! i’m not sure how you want to define coming of age, but for novels, i usually consider it within the realm of the first few milestones of adulthood. with that in mind, some books i like are franny and zooey by j.d. salinger, the idiot by elif batuman (which also has a sequel), the adult by bronwyn fischer, demian by hermann hesse, conversations with friends by sally rooney, and real life by brandon taylor. which are like. uni age / older young adult gripes. i also like a few novels that aren’t quite about coming of age, but do feature it as a plot element in a story that follows generations and decades in the same life; this includes the goldfinch by donna tartt (personally my fav bildungsroman), the book of goose by yiyun li, the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne (this author is generally one hell of a can of worms, though, if you’d prefer to avoid that), kite runner and a thousand splendid suns by khaled hosseini, and the neapolitan novels by elena ferrante. <br><br>for anime/manga/manhwa, i love our dreams at dusk, skip and loafer, sakamichi to apollon, k-on, heesu in class 2, solanin, and insomniacs after school. as for films, where the coming-of-age aspect is a bit more varied in form, the first few titles to come to mind are whisper of the heart, lady bird, aftersun, paper moon, y tu mamá también, moonlight, boy (the taika waititi one), rebel without a cause, stand by me, city of god, monster (the koreeda one), the case of hana &amp; alice (both shunji iwai’s live action and animated films), 20th century women, and — though not Particularly about coming of age — hunt for the wilderpeople, ferris bueller’s day off, pan’s labyrinth, thoroughbreds, and tokyo godfathers… wherein no one really comes of age, yet somehow i consider it tied to my own growing up.<br><br>just… to name… a few. i’m sure i’m forgetting so many, as i always do, and i want to emphasize that the majority of these are evaluated more for my personal connection to them than how prominent coming of age themes are in the media itself... in case that is a dealbreaker. a good few of them also don’t end on a happy/light-hearted note. but i find coming of age media are often the most heartbreaking of our whole lives anyway.</div>

 <div class=reply>i’ve watched and shown others the rondo short so many times that i probably have memorized the tango itself but did you see the light cone too. did you See the light cone. bc the light cone was my final straw. i felt like that infinity pool scene where mia goth is just firing shots all over the room and screaming. the flavour oh my god the spice the kick the flair i’m beside myself ohhhhhhh they’re taking it<br><br>literally the same evening the rondo short came out a friend was like hey isn’t it funny that they paired the guy sentenced to inevitable death with the doctor who believes every life is worth seeing through and i sent a dm back like hey wouldn’t it be funny if they also properly paired up the lady who deals and specializes in collecting memories with the pseudo-amnesiac with so many horrors worth both forgetting and remembering. then they did it in the most intense, unignorable way possible. i need to stop being gagged by every trailer/short we’ve gotten since like. ichor of two dragons. bc it’s getting ridiculous. but the acheswan short was just. so far beyond. what my tiny brain could have anticipated. like what the hell do they want from me now.<br><br>i was looking forward to black swan for so long mostly out of interest in the factions following fuli, but pairing a memokeeper who handles memories like they’re candy with the unexpected amount of lore we’ve received on acheron when we’ve Just started penacony is crazy of them. Crazy. i think the yummiest thing about their dynamic is this almost perverse interest that black swan has in people’s memories; she speaks of them like they’re delicacies to be enjoyed, in the same way that ifrit talks about wreaking havoc despite the low likelihood nanook will gaze upon them. for her to be faced with memories that for once consume Her, for these particular memories to be out of her control and her enjoyment, and for her interest to change shape accordingly while acheron is out here literally as a vessel for the inevitable, all-consuming pull of nihility — why’d they cook so hard here. sexual tension and power dynamics via memories is a wonderfully deranged elevator pitch for a pair of characters, and i really, really hope we keep getting more. <br><br>something i find so wonderful about hsr is how the universe is so huge and its most powerful entities truly, truly omnipotent that it’s hard to imagine what can pull characters to each other. yet they surprise me every single time with the dynamics they manage to form in so many different ways, and for so many layers in each to be available in ways specific only to that one dynamic. like who came up with Hey What If We Did A Sexually Charged Tango Between A Follower of The Remembrance and A [redacted in case of spoilers] And It Devolves Into The Brutal Memories Waiting In The Shadows. the sequence where only their shadows are dancing and black swan is getting dragged around like prey being disemboweled is actual cinema.</div>

 <div class=reply>no but deadass 😭 i once told a non-canadian mutual (who suggested it about more tasteful things like cronenberg and schitt’s creek) that for better or worse canadian-made films/shows and even online content just have a vibe to it that you can pick out even when you don’t know yet that the creator is canadian. then you find out and it’s like oh! obviously! idk what it is. it’s palpable in even youtubers. but for all we know i’m just hearing a subtle torontonian accent and it has nothing to do with content lmaooo</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha! i hope the weather's cool how you like it where you are. it's early autumn for me and yet the days have still been exceedingly hot, but thankfully the week ahead is bringing a nice chill along. <br><br>i'm a first-year university student (4 weeks in) and went into it pretty optimistic, but i've found myself feeling quite lonely. i'm trying to take care not to bog myself down into irrational absolute truths like "i'm shit at making friends" or "i'm never going to find My People", because i know those are at best unhelpful and at worst straight harmful. but fuck is university lonely. do you have any advice? i'm sorry, i know that's a pretty big ask.<br><br>thank you always. &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, i know… i can taste that loneliness even now. it’s horrible. even people with friends feel the loneliness that uni brings in some part. you’re all in a new place where the Majority are people you don’t know, and that never really stops being true. it’s easy to be isolated, bc everyone has their own lives to figure out and no interest in everyone else’s loneliness. <br><br>whether you really are “shit” at making friends or the most extroverted busybody known to man, the truth remains that making friends means shooting at something you can’t see. extroverts just don’t care that that’s what it is. i think... the main concern in making friends should be the question of putting yourself in positions to meet people. not the meeting / process of making friends itself, but the literal place. whatever your interests are, how can you meet people with it? do you have to get a literal part-time job just to have something in common with one other person? is there one other person in your group project that you kinda talked more with than the others? can you find them on social media? can you fake a scenario to use where you can talk to them? you can work your way up infinitely between “how did you do on that __ midterm?” or “want to share notes?” to the Big Question of asking if they wanna hang out. <br><br>if it’s too daunting to hang out with someone for the first time, go see a movie/something related to a subject you have in common. you can spend hours not worrying about the conversation, and have something to talk about after (ideally) over food. don’t be afraid to ask questions that sound stupid. don’t make self-deprecation the majority of the conversation, but don’t be afraid to laugh at yourself and your mistakes. leave questions open-ended, to give them a way to reply with something that isn’t yes or no. the best part about talking to people you don’t know that well yet is that there’s an infinite amount of things to ask. anything is a conversation starter, and anything that feels “silly” in the moment is an inside joke in the future. <br><br>god, i’m seeing myself type and i know none of this is remotely helpful to your very personal situation. i hate for the advice to be to Just Put Yourself Out There, bc yeah sha no shit. but most people are going to be desperate for friendship either way; the time will pass anyway, and it will ache to know the desperation could have gone into at least an attempt. you’re only in uni for a few years. some of these people you will completely forget ever existed in a few years’ time, others you will remember forever. you’ll never know which one until you have candidates. i understand it’s not easy to hear that you have to literally insert yourself into places where it’s easy to feel unwanted, but. sometimes the only way to go through is to get there and stop thinking. <br><br>i’m sorry i can’t be of more help. i’m sending you all the companionship i can bottle in this one message.</div>

 <div class=question>Hi, Sha. I hope you're good.<br>I've been reading Some kind of we lately and since English is not my first language I struggled somehow with the timeline of the story, if you don't mind, if you really don't mind ( please feel free to) I'd like you - kindly- to arrange for me the events. Does The Okinawa take place before the beginning of the story ? and the final scene where Megumi asks Yuuji to move with him; does it take place before or after Okinawa? <br>and the kitchen lovely so lovely dancing scene too?<br>I hope I'm not bothering you with this.<br> much much thanks to you &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>no no don’t worry, i’m sure you aren’t alone in this !! <br><br>the trick to it is that the scenes go back-and-forth from past and present. let’s call the main story of some kind of we “present time,” which should be a year after the events of flls chapter 7, with both of them now living in chiba. “present time” includes all scenes in some kind of we from megumi at the grocery store &gt; him coming home to yuuji sleeping &gt; them cooking dinner and dancing &gt; sitting out in the fire escape &gt; going out on the bicycle. <br><br>everything else is a flashback, meaning it all happened Before “present time”: megumi telling gojo he’s leaving tokyo &gt; the okinawa trip &gt; megumi getting sick &gt; visiting yuuji’s grandpa’s grave. <br><br>with the quotes below pertaining to the specific scenes in some kind of we, it should look something like this arranged in chronological time: <br><br>1. the main events of flls chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 <br>2. first half of flls chapter 6 (the morning of tsumiki’s wedding day)<br>2. flls chapter 1 (the afternoon of tsumiki’s wedding day)<br>3. flls chapter 6 (the evening of tsumiki’s wedding day)<br>4. “Three years ago, Megumi had tracked Ieiri Shoko to the backyard of the Gojo-Geto home and, looking at her through the wisps of smoke between them, asked if she knew any veterinary clinics that would let him work for school credit.” (some kind of we)<br>5. flls chapter 7, yuuji moving to chiba and finding out megumi lives here now<br>6. “Their first ever June together, Megumi had spent an entire day convincing a stubborn Yuuji to come along to Okinawa.” (some kind of we)<br>7. the actual okinawa trip, which begins with “But in the end, Yuuji hadn’t needed Megumi by his side.” and ends with “Megumi, you’re the best thing in my whole, entire world.” (some kind of we) <br>8. “A month after Okinawa, they had stood hand in hand in front of Itadori Wasuke’s grave, the cemetery cool around them in the tree-lined shade and a crawling kind of hot in the sun.” (some kind of we)<br>9. “When summer had drifted into fall last September, Megumi found himself walking to class with a stuffy nose and a throbbing headache, and, by the end of that two-hour lecture, the beginnings of a fever.” (some kind of we)<br>10. present time in some kind of we<br><br>that still looks too confusing, huh. a quick tip would be that anything in past tense in some kind of we is in the past; anything in present tense is in the present. also: if a scene in some kind of we has the left facing moon before it begins (☽) then it’s a flashback/past scene. if a scene has the right facing moon moon before it begins (☾) then it’s the present time, with megumi and yuuji’s current evening in their apartment. <br><br>i hope… this makes sense. happy to clarify a bit more if not 😓</div>

 <div class=reply>a housemate once described my diet as being exclusively “pastries, hors d'oeuvres and an infinite line of different beverages” which in some respects i always think was a slight (and deserved) dig at my laziness about cooking, so you can imagine how little i like to do it. i’m Probably not terrible at it — my cooking is apparently commendable enough to get unwanted Your Future Spouse Is So Lucky comments from my mother to my coworkers — but there’s a joke amongst my friends and even family members that the greatest invention mankind has given me is the air fryer, and they would be entirely correct. so. a slight disclaimer about what cooking entails if it’s me we’re talking about 😭 <br><br>i’m almost never sitting down to eat unless i’m out with friends to do it, so if i can’t eat it from a bowl on the go, and if it’s an unnecessary struggle to eat while reading/typing, i don’t often cook it. this unfortunately rules out soup and porridge-type dishes, which i do love but never make myself, and anything that requires multiple steps over more than a half hour max. that leaves my cooking roster with a series of homemade veggie meatballs, perogies, buns (like baozi and siopao), dumplings, pre-made dips for crackers, etc. <br><br>mushrooms are my everlasting best friend, though! i try to put it in anything, from pasta to pairing it with salmon, which i usually bake after tossing it a bit in teriyaki sauce and aioli if i can afford it that month. i like crisp greens, like bokchoy and leeks and spring onions, especially when paired with something textured like a creamy sauce or a well-grilled eel over soft rice. i often default to pasta when i just don’t wanna think about meals, partly bc they have amazing shelf life and make for good discounted bulk-buying and partly bc there’s so many ways to use them. my favs to cook are a rotation of red sauces and the occasional aglio e olio, both with spaghetti. but again. that can get messy to eat / prepare / heat up, so i just make them when i absolutely must.</div>

 <div class=question>Hello, dear Sha.<br>It is an honour for me to be here. I am happy for whatever reason has brought me to you here so far. Your kind replies and your generous person have made me not hesitate to send this message now. I was really eager after reading the ask "itafushi during the holiday season" and I felt a thirst for your opinion on another matter that has been on my mind since I finished reading Flls and every time I reread it. Even now, please, if you feel any sense of discomfort, you can do what your heart dictates about this, I apologise in advance for any uncomfortable feeling I bring by this from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>Lately I've been obsessed with the reels of grooms crying as soon as they see their brides. I couldn't help but think of Megumi. I think he would have cried too. He would have cried like he'd never cried before.<br>It is as if I see him crying and moving the hearts around him until everyone around him breaks down in tears.<br>It is a sweet feeling, words do not seem appropriate to describe it, perhaps it is the feeling of a win at that time, over obstacles and over oneself, perhaps a feeling of fortune, perhaps of responsibility, though Megumi was always worthy of the responsibility of Yuuji's heart. I knew love through his actions, I knew love through his tenderness, and I knew that Yuuji was the only one who deserved all that from him.<br><br>So a moment like this, a moment so poetic like this, is like a dream, a burst of sweet wishes, the best ending for everyone who carries the same love, who shares the same story and ; and language fails me so much right now, I can't find the right description for my feelings right now. Flls has always been deeper than what can be put into flowery letters. so, thank you for making me feel this way.<br>Thank you for creating something that we knos will stay in our minds, a story whose characters we take with us wherever we go, looking at things and situations from their perspective and wishing them all our true, living feelings and happiness.<br><br>you're amazing, you're a blessing for everyone who passess across Flls. <br>thank you. thank you.</div>

 <div class=reply>sometimes, someone’s kindness burrows its way to somewhere deeper than i usually feel it and it makes me feel so much that my stomach hurts… this is one of those messages. thank you, thank you, thank you, for the incredible amount of care and thought you’ve put into this message and towards flls. i think there’s something wonderfully cyclical about how much love people allow into their hearts over a story about love.<br><br>but speaking of things that trigger intense emotion !! there’s an early draft of the flls coda where megumi visits nanami in malaysia with yuuji and haibara many years after the events of flls. i thought hey, this is the perfect chance to give megumi a parallel to his conversation with nanami in flls, which kinda reduced him to his youth and his inexperience at what it truly means to love someone. i envisioned a scene where megumi basically asks for nanami’s blessing before proposing to yuuji, and i imagine nanami would try to say something neutral about how yuuji isn’t some object to give away, but he’s touched enough to need to be quiet for a few minutes too long. i figured — all the ways that megumi feels in the flls convo with nanami, about feeling small and helpless and unsure, will also be how he feels when he goes to nanami for his blessing as yuuji’s de facto guardian, but this time it will be for only good reasons. maybe megumi won’t be able to help tears welling up bc i’m sure the depth and seriousness of how this moment has been a long time coming won’t be lost on him or nanami. as you said, megumi was always worthy of the responsibility of yuuji’s heart. nanami knows that. he’s just been waiting for megumi to not only know it, but believe it and commit to it. giving his blessing is as much belief and commitment as nanami and megumi will ever need about megumi and yuuji’s relationship. <br><br>unfortunately it felt too far into the future for what i wanted to do in skow, but in my mind it remains a thing that happens in that universe. so. all this to say that i can definitely see megumi being the kind of groom who cries. yuuji will keep joking that he’s the one who’ll start crying before their little ceremony even starts, but he doesn’t actually cry until the morning after, when all of it catches up and suddenly he’s standing in the kitchen waiting for the coffeemaker (is it the same one megumi had in yuuji’s apartment? probably not. that’s a little much. but it’s a nice thought.) and his ring catches a ray of sunlight and the tears hit him so full force that megumi is mildly alarmed when he sleepily walks into the kitchen.<br><br>it’s crazy, truly, how fully fledged these two are in my minds. characters always feel this way, but i think with the flls boys, i’m indebted to how much readers like you keep them alive by believing in their love for each other. which is even crazier if you ask me. thank You endlessly for being a blessing ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>you know what i haven’t thought even Once about any romantic pairings in this series so this question is leaving my head completely blank… but. i did make a joke once about how the idea of shin and seba (natsuki) dating makes shin and mafuyu’s grudging in-laws dynamic even better than it already is. <br><br>now that i’m thinking about it more seriously though i do enjoy how far their dynamic has come in the series and feel like shin and natsuki would be incredibly fun to see together. idk. maybe shin just has this vibe where anyone he synergizes with automatically makes it seem like you can imagine an eight-year relationship between them, where they’re comfortable enough to finish each other’s sentences and shove each other off the couch. i think it’d be kinda sweet to envision a college au with established relationship shin/natsuki, except they’ve been in college for like eight years bc shin’s trying to get a full psychotherapist license and natsuki is on year god knows what of his hellish mechanical engineering degree. they’re like. old people in young adult bodies. they’d be 21 and complaining about all their aching joints and giving each other violent “massages” that they complain about leaving bruises. shin’s the type to fall asleep and drool on natsuki’s shoulder on the subway ride home; natsuki doesn’t notice bc he’s on his phone going over the blueprint he started working on in a manic haze the night before. nothing else happens in this hypothetical story except their day-to-day trying to keep each other alive and fed. mafuyu drops by and complains about everything being dirty. the sakamotos drop by and help with everything. xiaotang and akira drop by and prove to be somewhere in between those two ends of the spectrum.<br><br>you literally didn’t ask for an au idea i’m sorry anyway no i’m not really attached to any pairings romantically But while i can’t prove it i fully believe sakamoto, nagumo and rion all did it with each other at least once. tried, at least. was it successful? we have no way of knowing.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have not caught up in ages, my god, but i love it a lot! it’s an all-time fav for me, and definitely one i feel i can always rely on for the best of the shounen formula. it’s so fun, the dynamics deliver even in bite sized arcs, the art is sick, the characters are cool as hell and as thematically interesting as they can be in a simple and straightforward story. i feel sometimes that me not being able to pick a favourite in a story is a sign of a well-rounded cast; if there’s no one single character i feel passionate about, then 6 times out of 10 it’s probably just that the author has a deft hand working through a really dynamic cast. that feels extra true for sakadays. <br><br>i do have my individual favs (gaku &amp; nagumo, among others, so you can imagine the urgency people ran to me with when That fight started) but it’s not so much above all the rest that i’ll be writing essays about anyone the way i would for my fav characters in other stories. i’m happy to spend time with most sakadays characters, and there hasn’t been an arc that felt like a drag. it’s not perfect the way i think of, say, mp100 and fma:b as perfect, but it’s a series i trust with my enjoyment? i can put it on a pedestal and leave it alone for years and it will still be here when i come back, no dust or rust collected. <br><br>idk if you wanted specific thoughts about specific dynamics, which i’m sure i have even if none come to mind immediately right now… but speaking generally, it’s just a really lively story. it’s confident in its own zip-and-zap momentum, and without forgetting heart and charm. i do think it’s too hesitant sometimes with huge thematic holes about the nature of being an assassin, and whether that’s a life you can truly consent to and opt out of. in some respects, it’s still only shounen in the end, and there’s only so much it can try to advance about ideological differences between shin, sakamoto, the other association assassins, slur and his group. these are characters who have wronged and been wronged in this world to irredeemable degrees, yet the story is forced to choose a side in moralizing who gets to be the hero. which is a disappointment. but sakadays never purports to be more than what it provides, and on that, to be fair, it’s done a perfect job. so many balls juggled into the air and not one dropped. no sweat on the juggler’s face, either. effortless, strong at its core, level and balanced. and very very fun to witness 😊 <br><br>so no, i haven’t thought about writing for it, nor can i imagine anything i would want to? no notes here from me at all, shockingly. it can keep doing its thing and i’ll be a happy, satisfied viewer with my bag of sweet potato chips.</div>

 <div class=reply>no seriously it’s kinda amazing how fictional dreamscapes have a distinct visual language of their own even across stories and mediums. there’s just a specific wrongness we associate with dreams that make their way into everything from alice in wonderland to labyrinth to tim burton to inception. i think a child’s dream &amp; the dreamscape hotel are the penacony areas so far that i’ve explored the most and i just find myself really loving their flavour of eerieness. the abandoned food station, the toys from someone’s bygone childhood, the music box ost… i love how they play with size, tea party decor, the mirrors, etc. in a way you’d see in most alice in wonderland visualizations. it’s a nice route to opt for over embracing a darker, more overtly “scary” aesthetic, especially in this form of a child’s whimsical / fantastical dream-nightmare. there’s a very clear visualizing of what an interrupted / aborted childhood looks like, which i would argue is present in alice in wonderland as well and allows the visual elements to shine the way i like to see them best — slightly wrong, slightly familiar, slightly foreign. <br><br>as far as outright parallels go: definitely misha as the rabbit, huh. i’ve seen a few people try to finalize which references are whose, and the most frequent connections appear to be misha as the rabbit and aventurine as the queen of hearts. but i also wanna raise clockie as something along the lines of how time is its own character in alice in wonderland, and i wonder if it might make more sense if sunday &amp; robin were instead two queens, and aventurine was a mad hatter type…? maybe? i’m not too attached to any of those and might feel differently after 2.1, but i suspect aventurine will have a (failed?) execution in his near future. i also wouldn’t be surprised if we get a jabberwock reference in a later boss fight, if the something unto death creature isn’t literally already it.<br><br>if you can indulge me for a bit longer, i think… trauma + losing the light of childhood idyll / what makes life worth living are such big components of the penacony quests, down to the npc missions, and it has me thinking about a paper by rachel telfer on how alice in wonderland has no overt traumatic event yet unfolds exactly along the de/reconstructive process of trauma. part of what i love about penacony and the ways it has surprised me so far is how much it commits to “carroll’s emphasis on disorder and chaos [...] not only does carroll push the boundaries of reality, he provides a guide to regaining a sense of self, language, and world through wonderland’s many conversations.” which is just a pretentious way for me to say i love the fracturing of the psyche represented by the fracturing of the dreamscape, &amp; how it’s captured via how alice in wonderland does the same.<br><br>suffice to say i am both excited and scared for 2.1 and will be on the lookout for more alice 🫡 i’d also love to hear your list if you’d ever be willing to share !!!</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha!! hope you're having a good weekend! i first fell in love with your writing through so it goes (which subsequently got me into bllk) and when i finished i was reminded of this essay by summer farah titled "Wanting to Want: Romance and Sports Anime" <br>i am currently going through a nebulous phase of Burnt Out and so it goes!rin's emotions spoke to a very specific part of my brain as well as the concubine line in chapter 3 b/w rin and isagi in the art gallery + ik this is an older work but yuuri's relationship with piano in dear true love also stuck with me a lot. i was wondering if you have any thoughts/could talk a little bit about this? i'm still trying to find the words for this phenomenon but like. the theme of falling in (and out, especially interesting in cases where it's the same difference) love with something you've done your whole life while also grappling with the oftentimes suddenly defined presence of Everything outside of it? if that makes any sense sjdjd. ty for reading if you do i'm so so grateful to have been able to experience your writing</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you so much for engaging with my work to this extent and depth, whoa. i always say that rnbc / bllk readers have been so singularly kind to me but it really is not a joke at all 🤍<br><br>(and let me open a tab on “wanting to want”… such a good headline for the appeal of sports animanga… something about the secondhand hunger and the devotion that arises when you put multiple characters with different relationships to wanting what’s meant to be a shared goal and/or takeaway from this one collective endeavour.)<br><br>ahhh i love the so it goes museum scenes so much too !! i continue to be wonderfully mystified by how much warmth so it goes has received but seeing the connection to dear true love is like. ah! a love story between a character so afraid to let the outside world in that instead of purifying their rs with their craft it calcified it until they’re left alone to reckon with what has always existed outside of that. i like visualizing romantic love on the same level as love for one’s passion, so it made sense to parallel bachira’s first love and rin’s love for soccer, and for isagi &amp; yumi’s rs to be what it was. but if so it goes and dtl have a shared sub-sub-theme, it’s that living your life does and should not take away from that which you love. letting the Outside World into what you love does not subtract the love already there. loving is no excuse to forgo living, bc there isn’t one without the other. when we feel burnt out from one, it’s often bc we’re not doing enough of the other. <br><br>blue lock (the project) always makes me think... to give so much to this one thing and only this, what will be left once all of it is gone? and how do you hold onto love without a vessel? how do you keep what was still real despite the ephemerality of this container that made you part of a collective history? and when you find that the love that has had one direction to go this whole time suddenly meets only a wall, how do you stop that love from bouncing off and hurting you instead?<br><br>sometimes i wonder if falling out of love would hurt as much if it isn’t nearly always a reminder that no matter what, we will always be left in the aftermath alone and only ourselves. love lost is to feel abandoned by the love, even if we abandon it first. that’s the best and worst part of experiencing anything, let alone something (or someone) you loved: that you will always still be you after all is said and done. the search in the aftermath is only ever ours alone. maybe that’s part of what makes it so weird to have to find a way to redirect love somewhere else and to suddenly live a life not dictated by what was once the Important Thing in it. with how irrevocable both living and loving are, though, i do think it also goes to say we need only live to eventually find love again. but this likely isn’t what you sought from a reply, &amp; i can feel the start of an unrelated tangent coming, so i’m gonna zip it.</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t think i would, no. or rather... there’s an impulse to say it depends on where you draw the line between belief and practicality/practice. which. i know how it sounds to answer this particular question with that, but despite my primarily anti-government, anti-institution, anti-authority beliefs in everything from healthcare to academia, i also can’t say i wholeheartedly believe that society can survive without some kind of overarching governing body. <br><br>what i’m certain of is that with the world being as it currently is, the only ideals i can see myself subscribing to is violent resistance and abolition of all coercive governments and their enablers. especially of the kind we see in late stage capitalism, where even prisons and hospitals are sources of labour central to maintaining the hierarchical status quo. i find that when people argue for a need to keep the governments and systems we currently have bc “it maintains order,” this just reflects to me a naivety about the responsibilities that governments and systems are most definitely Not attending to. my view is that nothing about the current state of things is working: not our code of laws and rights, the ridiculous legal system and “free market,” not the constitution, not the free healthcare, all of which i acknowledge i also benefit from as a canadian citizen. if we could accomplish decentralization and the banishment of permanent authority, that’d be my ideal society, but therein is an element of utopianism and idealism, too, and i don’t necessarily believe we’re capable of reaping the strengths of true anarchy as we are right now.<br><br>(also. i realize i’m answering this question in good faith that we have the same definition of being an anarchist. i Am cognizant of how much colonialism and overall political powers have done to paint anarchism as synonymous to chaos and complete devolvement into an unstructured society. we’re a society trained to associate anarchist leanings with lawlessness and disorderliness. i know that this kind of propaganda is designed so that we do not question the “necessity” of authority in managing a complex society. i want to be clear that this isn’t how i view it myself.) <br><br>the bottomline is i would love a world that has done away with hierarchical decision-making bodies and has embraced the importance of smaller, more local lifestyles over the global profit-and-status-driven collective. but that’s an argument that people have tried to advance for marxism and other adjacent / left-libertarian ideologies as well. in the end, in what i want / can envision for society as a whole, i still believe there are forms of government and communal care that are more seamlessly put in place and more sustainable for all in the long run than anarchism. even if i do consider myself an anarchist in ideals to some degree, i also don’t believe in it in any way as an actionable end goal plan for society as a whole. if any of this makes sense.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha, how do you feel abt all the parallels in jjk? i know you havent kept up with it but i skipped a few chapters just to see how gojo’s death played out. theres a fighting scene afterwards between sakuna and another sorcerer that asks him “did you become the strongest sorcerer, or were you born that way?” ofc this obviously recalls stsg but like. why. lmaoo idk maybr im just completely illiterate but these parallels feel useless to me? like why cant characters be their own character? same with maki paralleling toji too. idk. just wanted to see what u think… also while im here, how do u feel sbt gojo’s death and how it was brought about? hope ur taking care &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>honestly there’s probably nothing jjk can do right now that won’t make me go ok lmao 🕴🏼<br><br>but also. in the interest of objectivity. there is... still... consistency… in how the jjk world is trapped in these cycles that rely on being preserved. it’s what sets apart characters like sukuna and yuuji and i’d say geto, whose existence deviates from the mold that perpetuates those cycles. there’s an in-canon “natural” order that jjk makes a point of maintaining vs. challenging (kenjaku, mahito, etc); everyone in the series gets assigned accordingly and removed when they try to challenge easy categorizing (nanami, mechamaru, mai, etc).<br><br>the whole tragedy of jjk is its world’s misled belief that everything has already been written and to resist its flow is futile; it’s what geto rebels against, what megumi’s entire philosophy &amp; desire to save yuuji stems from, what ends up being toji’s undoing, what allows maki to be her “own person.” the problem is no one ever told gojo specifically that he can deviate, which is personally how i interpret the “are you strong bc…” stsg quote. as far as ability is concerned, gojo Can change the jujutsu world, yet he’s cornered into a position that renders him an idea, a concept, more than he is a person, such that he himself eventually bought into being literally untouchable. but gojo IS the system. he’s the compass with which we can examine other characters. there is still a core point in how gojo was crowned by the heavens, by divine law; sukuna crowned himself; toji (and geto) sought to create their own laws to live by. as far as parallels go, they exist in order to highlight the characters who do deviate from the whole... master plan of existence everyone’s trying to hijack. <br><br>my thoughts on gojo’s death is that i hope it sticks. i don’t have any particular complaints about how it happened, surprisingly. what i want for gojo is escape from the story — literal and metaphorical — that caged him. it’d be pretty horrible for him to return from death for the umpteenth time to continue fighting for a cause he doesn’t even believe in and hasn’t for a long time. him seeing everyone in the afterlife or whatever the hell was lame, but it held true to his character. i think gojo the person stayed 17, and the only thing that would sadden me about his death is if he had even that taken away from him.<br><br>idk if any of this is making sense ahhh i think the parallels are very much there and necessary bc jjk at the bare minimum needs them for momentum. i’d be surprised if gege even realizes how quickly they like to give the story back ups for the roles it needs filled (todo &amp; hakari, nanami &amp; higuruma, etc.) BUT it’s like. whatever. it’s just such a crowded, over-saturated story that those strengths don’t get to shine and the characters don’t get to be truly themselves. you’re definitely right. it’s a shame. there’s a way to do it well, but the story just doesn’t want to make it available. it’s pretty ironic.</div>

 <div class=question>completely unserious question — and definitely not trying to get too personal — but have you ever been victim of the ‘ao3 curse’? i find stories like that to be so hilarious in that they seem so exaggerated or cartoonish, but it’s also why a lot of people joke that they wouldn’t become an ao3 writer 😭 hope you’re doing well, all jokes aside, and that nights are much less colder for you than they are for me lol 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i had zero idea what it was until this had me looking it up but that’s so funny omg ?? i’m not sure if you’d count this, but i guess i technically wrote flls, hairpin turns &amp; the voltron fic through some rock bottom periods of my 20s so far. i have memories of exactly which scenes i wrote while bed-ridden / catatonic / had everything in my life imploding in ways i didn’t think possible / whatever you wanna call it, which is the sort of dramatics you have to find hilarious when looking back at it all. hairpin turns should have been written while working through a death in the family, and igyssr through a loved one going into a coma. my bnha fics were written in libraries during a summer i was running away from someone i lived with. so if anything, i feel like things have happened enough that the connection has to be circumstantial. and clearly none got in the way of finishing fics 😭 <br><br>maybe i just jinxed it and sent out an invitation to the universe to prove me wrong, but i also doubt these things wouldn’t have happened if i’d only not written. it’s such a funny little thought, though, huh. i had no idea it was so widespread as to be a phenomenon.</div>

 <div class=question>Hi there! I hope you’re doing well! I read the cc from awhile back where you said you’re okay with people making personal physical copies of your fics, so I hope it’s okay if I do that too? I want to make myself a copy of flls and I was wondering if you would be okay with me including your “autopsy report” + reflections of the second half in it too? I really enjoyed reading them and you mentioned it felt like writing a blu-ray special commentary feature so I thought it might be fun to include it, like how some books have a q&amp;a with the author at the end? I also wanted to make a personal copy of skow, so I was wondering if it would be okay for me to include your reflections on that one as well? But if you aren’t comfortable with that I completely understand! I just thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask 😅 thank you for sharing your writing and allowing us to be a part of this little universe you created ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>you know usually someone says this about their fav character and i’m like no actually i don’t think your sports anime guy would even touch anne carson but weirdly enough i think rin specifically would rock so hard with her tragedies... it’s in line with his interests and hobbies outside of soccer, and i do think both of the itoshis have a natural inclination towards weird shit even if rin will deny it. they both like a little freak, partly bc they are borderline little freaks as well (affectionate). <br><br>all this to say that i think rin is a great match for euripides. the vision is surprisingly clear. i imagine the trajectory of it being that he watches some horror-adjacent movie that turns out to be a retelling of a greek tragedy (like killing of a sacred deer, maybe), then he gets curious and starts reading wikipedia entries, before working his way through awkward translations and eventually discovering anne carson’s euripides collection and having a “wait. is this fucking play about us?” maddy euphoria moment. i can identify a lot in him that reflects some of hercules after his twelve labors, and i think anne carson’s h of h would suit him nicely as well.</div>

 <div class=reply>i think it’s so natural to be scared! i am as well, though i’ve also developed a bit of a distaste for this sentiment — which is not on you at all, to be clear. it’s more the overarching narrative of how the rise of ai art &amp; writing, as in the frequency of this practice, indicates a parallel trajectory in quality. idk if i agree with that.<br><br>i saw someone say once that the reason the “good” writing chatgpt churns out is so mediocre &amp; sterile to anyone with a discerning eye might be that the vast majority of english writing/speakers are just… not very good writers. the more people use ai &amp; the more it learns what counts as good writing for the people who use it, the more universal the mediocrity becomes. i find that disheartening, but the worry has never been that ai will write like me. i can’t even write like me. i think what i truly fear is a world of people who cannot write, and a world that only asks this much of its writers. a world complacent about producing and receiving language. if non-writers believe that the writing ai gives them is good, and if even writers believe their writing can only go as far as to be inevitably replaceable by ai, then it’s hard for me not to feel doomed. being confronted with your exact question as an inevitability is what i fear, i guess. again, that’s not on you. it’s bleak out there. i understand.<br><br>sometimes i think... there are over 171k words in english. an average sentence is about 15 words. if i’m not totally inept at using a calculator, that means there are around two unvigintillion ways to articulate a feeling. your writing “voice” are the variations you choose. chatgpt is trained by humans, &amp; unless every single one of those trainers is the height of modern writing innovation, most ai language learning models — and i emphasize language here, i’m sure it’s a different issue for visual ai theft — are designed to write like the average person’s understanding of articulate writing across time and all walks of life. it will always be neutral &amp; soulless not bc it’s a machine, but bc there are no governing rules of language learning that teaches a unique writing voice. even the prompt process of ai alone is reliant on a referential, universal language. there may be grammar rules and buzzwords to integrate, but complex words &amp; sentence structures do not equate automatically to good writing. beautiful sentences don’t exist in a vacuum. in a machine, there is only the vacuum.<br><br>i am not an optimistic guy, and i don’t mean to be obtuse about your question. but i think, so far, ai art has inadvertently cultivated in people a demand for human, innovative media. i think the moral argument about ai will always fall on deaf ears; we as a depraved society are way past that. but i still do find that people have an intrinsic sense of what art that matters must feel like, and that’s something that will only grow more desirable the more you withhold it. maybe. i can only pray there will still be artists then.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh man. you know how people say the barbie movie’s “impact” is reliant on how it’s essentially Yay! Baby’s First Feminism! in the same way that everything everywhere all at once is a boba liberal’s idea of a good narrative? that... is how i feel about rayne fisher-quann. <br><br>i find her writing forgettable and the scope of her culture commentary limited to neatly addressed points even as she tries to cover more supposedly nuanced matters related to womanhood &amp; the internet, two of the most interesting pools of culture criticism in the digital era. you Can argue her attempts at these are better &amp; more self-aware than having only performative talking points, but i think even she has been vocal about the inherent performance of her role as a pop culture critic in a tiktok age. it’s a tough line to be constantly toeing, and i imagine it’s gotten harder as mainstream media has given her opportunities that are the equivalent of a big pop star giving the opening act of their tour to an artist with a strong indie following but will otherwise never threaten their existing place in the industry. <br><br>all that said: there’s this wave of Hot Girl culture critics with self awareness to “balance out” surface privileges and expectations — which i think reflects that there are demographics to whom rayne fisher-quann’s presence and insight is valuable, even outright crucial. knowing she exists and is given a platform is a refreshing deviation from this over-saturated sea of content creators turned culture critics sharing the equivalent of a university course’s introduction reading list in newsletters and fashion magazine features — but she remains nonetheless a part of that group.<br><br>i see why she gains traction amongst readers younger than both her &amp; myself who might not be able to form these thoughts and this lens on culture on their own and have to be led to it in accessible forms. i am finding that that’s… a Lot of people, especially on the platform that fisher-quann came to prominence on, and hey, if people need someone to prompt the criticism in their brains to even be conscious of it, then this is someone who does it on a regular basis and does acknowledge nuance (if not nearly always complexity) wherever she is able. kids and teenagers who learn from her are in decent hands, at least right now.<br><br>there are worse options in this cultural climate, really. i think internet princess is a fitting title, and i sympathize with having to be an objective critic of the same culture that championed you, but i also think rayne fisher-quann’s appeal is for a specific kind of demographic and self-identified (and maybe misdiagnosed) “critics” &amp; internet media literati. <br><br>but also!! who am i to talk!! at the end of the day i’m a borderline illiterate reader of things who also happens to be protective of my canadian/torontonian culture critics, rayne fisher-quann included.</div>

 <div class=question>hello!!! lol sorry i might've accidentally sent an empty confession earlier because i am dumb...but anyway i just wanted to pop by and say i'm from the blue lock fandom and i pretty much exclusively dove into the rnbc deep-end by accident just headfirst with no end in sight 😂 i actually was just digging around and have no idea how i found myself over here but can i just say: it's a rarepair already with very few people writing anything for their wonderful dynamic, but i feel so incredibly fortunate to be able to read the works of someone who is clearly given a gift from God in writing?? an ability from the heavens, and you choose to write this diamond for such a small community; it's truly a blessing. "so it goes" is a story i go back to extremely often, and i don't even rly understand how to capture what you made me feel with that story, like i cannot even express the fullness in my heart that tingles its way up into my limbs and into the fresh air??? you have an incredible gift, thank you, really. and you've probably heard this a thousand times so this is barely special, but i just wanted to come all the way over to say, thank you. thank you for touching my soul so tenderly and making me open up my perspectives and reflections in so many ways, and overall just being a source of comfort in a lonely world. i will continue to return to it over and over again, but i just wanted to thank you at least once. thank you. also really random question: have you ever considered writing for haikyuu? i think there are some incredible dynamics there (always sports anime somehow killing it in heart-wrenching dynamics) so i was just curious 😂 anyway, hope you have a wonderful day!</div>

 <div class=reply>no no you’re good !! no empty messages on my end! but ahhhh thank you for reading so it goes and going as far as to write to me, first of all. it’s such a small, specific fic that i wish i tried more for, and it continues to astound me that more than two people read it bc yeah, you’re right, rnbc is such a rarepair for something with what felt to me was a goldmine of readily available stuff ?? i remember when i first published so it goes and someone sent me a thread about how bachira is so easy to “invent” dynamics for — and it was very much a lighthearted joking tone, but i had a mini crisis after like oh no does it seem like i’ve done something delusional and people are just indulging it out of kindness… do people think i pulled rnbc out of literally nothing 😭 rnbc made so much sense to me, as did the “ending” i gave rin in so it goes. the fic wrote itself exactly bc there was So much canon material, i thought. it’s wild to be on the other end of a whole fic and find that the room on this side is not what i thought it was going to be, but ultimately, i’m just glad to be here with good company. <br><br>all this to say — thank you for seeing the vision, and for being so eloquent and tender in writing to me. i don’t often expect anyone to follow me into whatever seemingly out of left field pairing/fandom i’ve tunneled down into now, so it’s always the nicest surprise to find people present and actively engaging. so it goes is by far the fic to shock me the most in the reception it has received; if i’d anticipated that at all, i would have done so much differently. like maybe edited it a bit more. proofread harder. i don’t know. thank you for loving the fic in all its rawness and imperfection. <br><br>i most definitely have not done anything to deserve the exceedingly high praise here, oh my goodness, but i am very, very grateful for it all the same. my heart broke a little — in all the right aches — upon reading “a source of comfort in a lonely world.” but you know, i always think that my writing wouldn’t move people if they didn’t approach it open to being moved in the first place, so in many ways, i have my thanks to toss back at you and the loving community that has formed around so it goes. it never fails to warm my heart. thank you, truly. <br><br>re: writing for haikyuu, here are two recent cc replies:<br>https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1339864741 <br>https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1340102761 <br><br>the tl;dr is that while i do agree there are so many incredible dynamics there, it just doesn’t feel like something i’ll write for as i currently am. i’ll always have an immense love for the series, but i doubt it will ever invite me to write… i’m sorry to disappoint, though i am very touched you’d think to ask me about it !! i hope you have a wonderful week ahead, wherever you may be.</div>

 <div class=reply>i adooooooore this question... it’s maybe less museum and more cultural centre, but i’d love to devote a space to the showcase and preservation of literature in translation? its history, milestones &amp; controversies; the role of interpreters &amp; translators everywhere, from the role of the arts in early trading to today’s trials at the hague, both of which already present complexities for a curator to navigate; banned books across languages; the deliberate use of translated literature as propaganda, from hobbes being the first to translate thucydides to the harm a single book like mein kampf propagated; or even these really great reconstructions of bronze age music &amp; oral storytelling. <br><br>tangentially related but the other day i felt like looking into whether anyone has translated marcus aurelius’ meditations into latin, which interestingly should have been his native language… it led me to a curiosity spiral about all the source texts that has undergone a similar kind of homecoming-displacement. we know that the epic of gilgamesh and the tale of genshi are two notable and indisputable firsts in the history of storytelling, but when were they made “available” in other languages? or... there are museum projects in taiwan &amp; korea working on translation to preserve texts, and i find this fascinating bc what is cultural preservation in the context of the innate disassociation and/or reconstruction that the art of translation demands? i also recently attended an event dedicated to palestinian art and poetry, and was talking to someone about how the destruction has targeted schools, libraries, archives for a reason — a fundamental attack on culture, on records that can immortalize. there is just So much.<br><br>i also think… you know, museums are inherently colonial. there’s violence in the act of removing artifacts from the context of the place to which they belong, literal &amp; metaphorical; i remember sitting in this park about three blocks away from the colosseum, fixating on the ridiculous privilege of an ancient civilization that had, however much, secured its right to coexist with its descendants, all while so many countries are calling for the british museum to return items rightfully theirs. whether artwork or ancient relics, there is just no removing an object from the environment it is local to and moving it to an institution for “safekeeping” and “preservation” that isn’t willful displacement, even outside of colonial contexts.<br><br>this landmine is unavoidable with museums, yet you can argue all of it, interestingly, about translation as well. both deal with the imperfect and incomplete and inherently violent; both purport to preserve and circulate yet will always remain only a mimetic mirror copy of the original. i think it’d be really cool to present the art of translation somehow in a museum, which you can argue is an institution that matches its energy perfectly. there’s a synergy there that i can’t help hungering to see.</div>

 <div class=reply>you don’t have to read it, but i answered a similar question not too long ago (https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1344674638)! the tl;dr really is just that i love hsr, but unfortunately just didn’t like genshin at all.<br><br>i only made it to AR 50-something? which i realize isn’t very impressive, but i feel like... i did try... to give it an earnest shot... and devote myself to it in that time. granted, i played genshin for 2-3 months fairly recently vs. half a year of enjoying hsr even though the latter has been around for less time and technically has less content than an open world game that’s been out for years. the time frame very well could have played a huge part in my preferences, &amp; i wonder if my game experience would have been different if i stuck with genshin for the same seasonal content that everyone is used to doing and/or interacted with the community to make more out of the canon material. <br><br>from a beginner/casual player perspective, a lot of the redeeming genshin elements people wanted to sell to me just seemed to be different ways of. idk. trying to make what’s actually there just work somehow. i absolutely understand wanting the media you love to be more than what it is (i mean, really, what is any media interaction except meeting a thing halfway) and who knows, maybe i would have liked certain things more if i was fed the same level of community activity most players i know seem to be. in the end, i just felt like genshin gave me nothing to work with, nothing to be invested in, and nothing worth staying around for.<br><br>you don’t have to read this part onwards but — while i found myself scratching my head at what people find appealing about genshin, that could also very well be how genshin players feel about hsr. i know some people who mainly play genshin seem to struggle with finding momentum with hsr content, and it just makes sense for that to be true vice versa for me. i don’t think it’s ultimately fair to compare the games bc we’re working with entirely different worlds, narratives, writing teams &amp; game mechanics altogether. hsr is also given a variety of unprecedented privileges and resources, from its writers to the integration of player feedback, and the in-game quality of life is understandably much different. i am aware there’s a substantial amount of luxuries i get to enjoy that allows me to “prefer” hsr.<br><br>that said, even if you take away the player care, i think i also just happen to enjoy hsr’s gameplay and storytelling more, including the parts of it that are flawed! i don’t have a high threshold for sticking with things i don’t enjoy fully, &amp; i admit i lack the patience to be immersed in a game that i felt was neither challenging/stimulating enough nor especially rewarding. it’s a shame genshin fell in that category for me, bc it truly is a visually beautiful game. there’s a slim chance i drop back in for chiori or playable columbina purely out of love for their designs, but otherwise… i’m sorry, genshin.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, i miss it every single day. sometimes i open a page for some masters program bc the missing got to me.<br><br>i do think it’s an experience better missed than lived, though; for better or for worse, i’m glad that’s the university life i got to have, that i forced myself into those interactions even though i still know in my heart i could have done better — but i also wouldn’t necessarily relive or redo it, you know? there’s always this sense in the back of my mind that hey, i am now a more well-medicated and mature version of the me that was attending all those classes with students older and smarter than me, so “ah, i wish this is the version of me that university got to have.” i wish i was this well-adjusted when i went to school. i wish i’d been able to absorb more, engage more, apply myself more, than how i was able to back then, &amp; that i know i’m better able to now. but i think that’s true for just about anything in life, not just school. there will always be relationships and dynamics and environments that a different version of you will be the better fit for, and that’s how you know that version was only possible bc of that thing it was once incompatible for. that subconscious awareness tends to fuel the part of you that misses and yearns.<br><br>i guess what i mean to say is that yes, i do miss it so badly most days, but the missing usually shows up synonymous to the mourning on behalf of university era me. if that makes sense. i imagine it would feel even stranger for you, since literature courses benefited the most from discussion and that’s not really a dynamic you can self-engineer once you’re out of a school setting. i won’t tell you to enjoy it now while you still you can — god knows i’d just be rearing to get out in your place — but i do hope you are able to form tangible mementos of this particular experience somehow! it’s a shame how quickly memories leave us, but i hope there will be simple things to remember in the future. in my last few months, the things i held closest to heart were the inside jokes and shared exam season delirium.<br><br>i was in an especially terrible headspace for my last two years in uni, but no matter what, i also never want to be the kind of person who makes light of and acts with bitter pettiness about the education i received. i might about the institution of university &amp; academia, yes, but i think both educators and students have their own things to be accountable to in this dynamic, especially at the uni level. i know i didn’t do enough on that front, but what my educators did for me, even the ones that other students talked shit about it but i could clearly feel were trying — i do want to honour them as i would any experience. part of that is allowing myself to miss or mourn the part of my life they belonged to.<br><br>but i’m just yapping now haha congratulations on making it to graduation !! i hope the rest of your school year passes smoothly, and that you get to celebrate such a wonderful milestone ✨</div>

 <div class=reply>i suppose it is! though i genuinely don’t know when i would have discovered the song… it’s too popular not to just be one of those songs you’ve been hearing all your life, you know? like je ne regrette rien or fly me to the moon or clair de lune or twinkle twinkle little star. it’s like you’re born knowing the song just bc it’s everywhere before you even knew what songs were. maybe breakfast at tiffany’s was my first encounter with it? but even that already feels too late. i’m honestly not sure, i’m sorry. i do know i chose the title for the substack partly bc of the line in moon river and partly bc of the mark twain connection. huckleberry finn is my fav twain character, so it just lends that line from the song a little bit of heartache.</div>

 <div class=reply>ohhhh :( i never know if it’s a good thing when people relate to either of the flls boys in the sense that that experience is not something i’d wish upon myself or anyone, but what fascinates me is how there’s this feeling of… wistfulness? almost? in how people describe this level of love. it makes me think oh wow there really is a kind of love that we as human beings give to one another without needing it returned to be real to us — the love will be there either way, and it will be immense and totalizing. <br><br>in any case i. don’t think you need to hear love advice from someone who doesn’t know what they’re talking about. but i do want to say thank you for trusting me with putting your feelings in writing. i hope things work out between you and her, in whatever form that might take. i think it’s an immense privilege to be able to say “so, so much” about any emotion, and for that emotion to be love, and towards one person whom you can also call a best friend — i’m rooting for you and your heart. thank you for sparing my story even a sliver of the love you give to others 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>have you ever played oxenfree? i really like the mc because even though it’s a story game where the player picks her responses, she still has a personality imo. nothing wrong with self insert mcs i just prefer this and her voice acting gives her a lot of personality. i would recommend it. it has a really interesting time loop plot too!</div>

 <div class=reply>i have not but you had me at time loop 🤭 oh and it has analog/90s horror elements too? i can’t believe i’ve never thought to check it out before despite hearing news about it; it sounds perfectly like something i’d love. (and i hear you on preferring mcs with their own notable personality.) consider it ready to go on my switch once i finish my current game — thank you for thinking to bring it to my attention!</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! was reading your cc before i go to bed and caught something interesting: non human humans being brought up with magical girls... I couldn't help but check your anilist to see if you've watched Madoka Magica, in which it's a very important thieme - to my surprise it isn't completed! i cannot say too much without spoiling, just in case, but im curious if you have plans to check it out (it's a classic, and i think would fit your tastes) and which other magical girls series happen to share this theme?</div>

 <div class=reply>my anilist is so disorganized my god but to be fair i might as well have never seen pmmm with how long it’s been since i did 😢 but i have seen it and was likely thinking of it at some point in the context of non-human humans! magical girl media is an interesting variation on it bc it’s almost… an advanced form of human? rather than a reduced form of humanity? i see the same element of longing i love, though in this case it’s to be equipped with a form/power that will ostensibly address the vulnerability of being without it. <br><br>pmmm’s version of the magical girl narrative is such a specific example of non-human humans bc it posits elevation of the self to the point that you give up humanhood. or at least paying your humanhood as the literal cost of the safety of something that goes beyond just the human/individual level. i Would argue pmmm is about being ultimately human, neither reduced nor elevated from that. whether it’s homura’s motivations or sayaka’s arc or how each of the girls embody grief in different ways, it’s bc they’re so human that the events of the story unfold (again and again) and that they’re used as pawns in a grander scheme of creation. their fatal flaws lie in how they long to be more Than human rather than long to be more human, which you can argue is the same but i also think pmmm explores the question of how... can you really be more than human, bodily, and still be human, emotionally? <br><br>i might have mentioned pmmm very briefly in a newsletter thing about blue lock, but like bllk, it’s just a nice example of how some media so subvert the genre they descend from that in doing so, they signal the death of those classic tropes as we know it. pmmm did so for the magical girl era, but in the context of the non-human humans business, this post is always somewhere in the back of my mind: https://x.com/curewiki/status/1180163641070346240?s=20<br><br>i think both mecha and magical girl stories benefit a lot from body horror, if not outright require it; mecha tends to be almost clinical with it, while magical girl media can’t help themselves from being picturesque, but there’s a blood cost to being a mecha pilot and a magical girl, both literal and metaphorical. so i always love when people treat pmmm as a horror story; there’s nothing quite as horrific as being trapped in this eternal universal time loop where you are compelled to protect something that cannot quite protect you in return. <br><br>idk if i have any similar titles in mind other than revolutionary girl utena is, which — i mean. is probably the only other super popular “magical girl” media “subversion” to be just as singular as madoka. but both pmmm and rgu do have two of the most memorable instances of the dehumanized saviour archetype to me. there’s just something so sophoclean about like. pursuing an ultimate ideal in the name of humane empathy and the cost of that pursuit being exactly that empathy. it’s such an ancient, primordial irony. i love it.</div>

 <div class=question>i discovered you years ago thru a tiktok suggesting your flls on ao3, and i’ve always seem to circle back to it whenever i consume a piece of literature or think too hard about whether i’m good enough— or believe in myself hard enough, i should say— to become a lit major. i’m rereading that fanfic again now, and i wonder how long it took for you to develop your style of writing? did you practice your words or do they flow naturally through you? i deeply appreciate your writing and always catch myself trying to imitate it— sorry, but i’d never publish any of it— did you experience something similar? to end this i just want to say that your writing inspire me to pursue english in the near future.</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhh this is always the hardest writing question for me to answer bc i’ve also been trying for years now to figure out what my writing style even is… it’s something that comes up a lot when people talk to me about my writing, but i guess the answer to your question is that no, ofc i didn’t practice the style itself. or at least not consciously.<br><br>i think… i know what feels good to write bc i know what interests me to write in fiction, but stylistically speaking, if i had to describe what i want my style to be doing at its best, it will probably just be what one of my personality typologies describes as “an interesting and layered argument where concepts form together in a pleasing way.” or maybe something that “covers more ground in reasoning, leading to longer arguments: the reason for this is they want to make it easy for the other person to change their mind internally.” i find i like to prioritize clarity and/or coherence of thought, which to be fair doesn’t exactly leave much room for beauty. some stats you have to choose to buff over others in a way, and a pretty/poetic style was never at the top of my list bc too much of it can get in the way of presenting my “arguments,” for lack of a better word. whatever strengths my writing has, i can prob credit to how i’ve tried writing in so many different areas. as a playwright, in a legal setting, as a journalist, film critic, columnist, a podcast scriptwriter, blah, blah, blah. other languages have also likely done a lot in changing my style! especially latin. i guess i’ve had to argue for some kind of point in so many capacities, and i wouldn’t be surprised if all that has taught me a thing or two about how to approach my writing “style” 😓<br><br>it’s beyond flattering to think you’d want to imitate my style at all, but a point i do want to end on is just that — i’d say my writing really isn’t very special, let alone beautiful. i’m like if a math theorist was a writer, and i think that’s reflected a lot in my writing. i like working from an infinite amount of variables to make something orderly and self sustained.<br><br>i’m not sure how to turn that into proper advice, but the main takeaway would likely be to try a bunch of things! writing isn’t just english literature &amp; poetry. there are so many parts of the formula to balance, and there’s something to learn from every genre: bare bones clarity from news journalism, dialogue from movie scripts, using verbs economically from this or that language. the wider your arsenal is, the more comfortable you’ll be intuitively pulling from what’s necessary to serve your point across the best. if that makes sense.</div>

 <div class=reply>i think there are stories out there that are made for you and your specific tastes, and hsr is one for me. it is by no means a perfect game; there are moments it holds back when it shouldn’t and ends up a little too subtle, and other times where it just straight up doesn’t commit to The Thing even with the full buffet right there. i understand this must feel unsatisfying to a particular kind of player, especially ones that only care about one region or a handful of characters, but i have had a blast. i have a little note where i write down every theme, device, motif and trope i love that it has hit and i think we were at 51 the last time i added to it? i feel like every mission, big or small, takes me by surprise even when i actively try to feel nothing for it so i can get it done. it’s not always deep emotion, but everything — and i do truly mean Everything — is interesting to me. i just find it a solidly interrogated collection of characters and stories; it’s not often i am pleasantly surprised by the route a story takes even when the boring archetypal trope would have been neater and easier. the game as a whole is just very dear to my space fantasy loving heart, but then you throw in doomed characters and relationships, very cool divinity lore, stories about everyday citizens, found families, torn found families, beautiful stunning breathtaking architecture — and there was no way i wouldn’t give it my whole heart. <br><br>i love the lore integrated into game mechanics, the visuals, the endgame content. i also feel… taken care of? as a player? i’ve never agonized over gacha pulling, building characters is both fun and demanding and has dopamine-producing payoff. nothing feels impossible or miserable, and there are so many complex backgrounds in the story to keep my brain very happy and never bored. i thought i’d be using the autoplay option a lot more bc that’s what a friend recommended hsr to me for, since i’m not much of a battle game player, but surprisingly i’ve never wanted to? i love the strategizing &amp; the higher ranked fights. i did wish we had more puzzles, but it seems like penacony is leaning into all of that with dreamspace mechanics and the murder mysteries. it’s So fun.<br><br>i did give genshin a shot quite recently! a former coworker hooked me with the wriothesley &amp; kunikuzushi backstories, i gave in and played for a couple months, made it to fontaine, but unfortunately… i fell asleep while playing on more than one occasion. it was that dull for me. which is terrible, and it wasn’t that i liked nothing, but the interesting bits were small, few and far between. mainly sumeru. i found it a low-effort game, not just on the devs’ part but mine as well. even when i tried to meet it halfway and just enjoy the ride, there was no challenge, no stimulation. they’re not trying, i don’t have to try — why are we here, you know? but it could also very well have just been a matter of incompatibility, and i do think it’s a truly visually stunning game.</div>

 <div class=reply>this is the first time i’ve been asked actually! not an especially fun story, though: it was just the name of a band i was writing in a haikyuu au at the time, with the lazy reference to the tokyo teams being called city boys by the story. it was just. too much of a hassle to spend time and energy on a usernames. and since the pseud i was using right before i made cityboys had also been inspired by an actual real life band name that i thought was cool, i just defaulted to the same logic when it was time to create a new one 😓</div>

 <div class=question>i’ve never seen a love story that lasted until the very end. people would stay together for a decade but they’d break it off because of unfaithfulness or just… boredom. i think I’m trying to say that i’m so afraid of commitment because I know for a fact that despite my obsession with the person, the moment I will say yes to being a partner in whatever capacity is the very moment I lose interest. is this the case for everyone? i’m not sure of the existence of love which stretches through time. i’m sure all cases bleed into familiarity and getting used to having them beside you, at best.</div>

 <div class=reply>hmm… if i may, and i promise i point this out without any ill intentions, i think the concept of people not being able to stay together universally is its own separate issue, as is you losing interest the moment it’s official and/or committed between you and another person? i think i’m just struggling to find what the connection is — the way it’s worded here implies that you lose interest the moment you say yes to being someone’s partner. i read that a few times to make sure i’m not misunderstanding, but i really do apologize if i’ve misinterpreted your words. <br><br>i’m not sure how to put this gently, but i feel like this is less poetic or sentimental in nature and more just. a related matter of some variation on an avoidant-dismissive insecure attachment style. not to clinicalize it, of course, but it sounds — and i could totally be putting words in your mouth — like you go through cycles of being obsessed with people and romanticizing what you could have with them, then feeling bored/scared the moment it becomes Too attached. whether or not you feel this way bc you know most people eventually break it off or get bored is, to me, a moot point. yes, it’s unfortunate, and yes, i am also a cynic about relationships, but i do softly have to draw the line at speaking of potential partners like they’re objects you need around bc of loneliness or societal pressure or whatnot, let alone objects you have to get used to having around. <br><br>maybe it’s my naivete or my lack of firsthand knowledge of requited romantic dynamics speaking here, but i do feel like people who haven’t figured themselves out bring volatility to any relationship that they expect to do the work for them. that’s not a bad thing in itself, some people might argue that’s what relationships are for — and yet i just don’t think the onus should be on any future partner of yours to prove you wrong if you yourself are aware of your tendency to lose interest and/or think jadedly about the longevity of the relationship. i think long-term relationships are a choice, for better or for worse. if even one party among those involved aren’t capable of making the choice for the betterment and compromise of both, then ofc the relationship is already doomed. but i think you already know you’re the reason your relationships fail.<br><br>i think staying together bc of some overarching powerful force is a myth. on that, i’m on your side — but i also think that means you have more choice than you realize in relationships, always. being robbed of the choice, whether by your own doing or your own history with attachment, means being robbed of relationships as relationships should be before any of them even begin. i think that’s very sad — but again, it’s not my intention to attack you, or to be needlessly cruel. that’s all i wanted to say, really, though i know you weren’t necessarily looking for a response: that it’s sad, and on that much, i understand what a dead end you might be feeling cornered to.</div>

 <div class=reply>ohhh i empathize so much… i have my fav animanga listed on my anilist if you want an easy way to click and see the summaries: https://anilist.co/user/173cm/ but few (if any) are fixation-worthy, honestly. you know how people say that men need a little ugly to be truly, truly hot instead of just nice to look at? i think that often about media. perfect media don’t invite fanaticism to the point of insane and delusional love. people want to believe it does, that what they’re going crazy over is just That good, but — idk. maybe it’s just me, but perfect stuff has a sense of settled, in-control-of-yourself contentment. but things that are good yet have that one small thing that’s subconsciously off, or just outright terrible media — those make us crazy.<br><br>that was tangential, though. sorry. but hmm… maybe it’s time to look a little bit to the left of animanga? like webtoons/manhwa, or danmei, or donghua. if you haven’t watched link click, it has two seasons and i find it’s a good universal recommendation, especially to anyone looking for something new without straying too far from the familiar. maybe a super long novel turned manhwa? like orv? you might have already ventured into both of these, actually. i’m sorry if you have, or if none of these sound like they’re up your alley… i hope you find something to relight the spark :(</div>

 <div class=reply>i have been drinking so much tea lately. like. so much. three teapots worth a day at minimum. this milk oolong i bought in bulk is so good. idk how i’m doing mentally or emotionally bc it’s definitely low enough for me to be better off ignoring it, but my headspace itself is just. Tea. i want a cup of oolong or a london fog the moment i wake up and the moment right before i pass out. i want it in between meals. in between any movement. that’s the only important part of how i’m doing. <br><br>my daily media consumption has mostly been split between my weekly animes of the season and my silly little mobile game. which is how it was last fall. and last summer. i feel like i haven’t really had the time for anything at all recently, and i’ve just been trying to keep up with what i have on my plate. which i promise is nowhere near as saddened/bitter as it sounds. as for work… last week, i had my final day at a job i’ve wanted to quit from literally day one, and it’s both a load off my shoulders and a constant but bizarre reminder of the habits it planted in me that will take a while to unlearn. at least i get to sleep in and focus on only one job for now. and drink a lot of tea without being stuck in three-hour meetings 🍵<br><br>i’ve also really come to terms in the last few months with sci-fi being my most favoured speculative fiction genre, so i’ve enjoyed exploring/rediscovering short stories from liu cixin, ursula k. le guin, ken liu, etc. for music, i’ve teetered from songs that put me in the body of a high school senior in an after-school band with the closest and unlikeliest friends one will make in a lifetime (liberators by magic of life, time of our life by day6, ryusei by meychan… i have a whole playlist. it was my first one of the year. it was just that kind of january.) to classic wintertime music (the japanese house’s cover of super trouper, my fav abba song; vienna by the army, the navy; riverside by ann annie, the new searows drops) <br><br>writing-wise, i’ve been scribbling out some original manuscript fragments, a little bit of hsr stuff... but i haven’t really written anything properly in months, tbh. they’ve been more like. half-scenes drafted in the notes app/untitled docs. it’s very strange for me to go through winter without writing more than 10k words, but maybe it’s not such a bad sign. i do need to wet the ink sometime soon and find momentum again. <br><br>in any case i am sending you all the love and warmth in return !! thank you so much for checking in, and i hope 2024 has been kind to you so far 🩷</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha !!! i hope the new year has been treating you warmly. has snow stayed on the ground for you yet ? it has finally come to my city, though it is probably less than an inch. but !!! other than that, i wanted to ask your opinion on lapslock and lack of quotation (maybe use of punctuation in general) i used to avoid all works that used either choices, out of personal ease, but i have recently read something that included both ! and it was kind of like. wow. that was the right choice. the usage felt appropriate. but i also wonder if the same mood would have been created without it. i have tried out the style myself since then, and uncomfortably, i did enjoy it ! here is a part of me that clings onto propriety, but also finding it freeing from both a reader's and writer's perspective. i dont feel bound to answers but also inside my brain is like. come on. do you need this to convey what you're trying to say ? why should it feel different if it's the same words ? deep down i know during the writing process it may not be such a problem, especially if it gets me to put something in words, yet i still find myself wanting to leave it in the state that it was created. im sorry this doesn't make sense at all !!! i think im just really saying: is it lazy ? do you believe it should be used ?</div>

 <div class=reply>around the time you sent in this cc, funnily enough, i think my city was in the middle of a snowstorm… the biting cold hasn’t lasted long enough… it’s february and it already feels like spring is around the corner ahhh<br><br>but hello!! this is an interesting question! i wouldn’t really say i’m much of a purist about the basics, actually. i’m of the opinion that any rule, from grammar to genre requirements, can be broken to serve your purpose. i think there’s always a place for Any writing choice — or rather, there’s a choice that will always be, if not the best one, then better than all the others. that can be first person pov, or deliberately messy tenses, or no quotation marks in dialogue, or how trust by hernan diaz was told in four different narrative “formats.” i agree completely that sometimes a mood can only be created with a particular choice. that also goes for certain themes, certain sentiments, certain perspectives. it’s part of the fun in writing prose to go for the unforeseeable. from my experience, it’s when i stray from the original path that i have run into the answers i need.<br><br>i also think “good writing” is helped by hijacking the voice inside someone’s head, or (in the case of someone who doesn’t have that naturally) inventing one altogether for them. that generally requires doing away with propriety altogether, not to mention the demands of english are so arbitrary and specific only to itself that any rules there are to play by are not truly codified. it’s kinda like being a knight sworn to the crown: you’re bound by loyalty and duty to whoever is on that throne, and you must serve and guide them, but if that monarch’s interests were to go against the interests of the kingdom, then it’s also within your duty as a knight to do something about that. idk why that’s the analogy i went for — but you know what i mean.<br><br>by-the-book writing is often vulnerable to being sterile writing, unfortunately. you can’t be the fixer of something you’re not willing to witness broken, &amp; writing comes down to maintaining the illusion that the words on the page are so raw they emerged exactly as the reader is seeing them. <br><br>anyway !! all this to say that ever since sally rooney came into fame, more and more contemporary authors Have stopped using quotation marks and it’s become something of a trend — at which point it’s no longer an authorial choice, and when that’s the case, it shows. it’s a bit unfortunate, though sometimes that or lapslock really is the only choice. either way and regardless, i’m willing to give reading and/or writing anything a shot at least once. <br><br>in the end, you serve the story no matter what. that means being down to do anything it asks for. there’s no reason formatting or style or punctuation should be excluded from that. if that makes sense. so if you ask me, it actually makes a writer the opposite of lazy to seek and settle on whatever that right choice might be.</div>

 <div class=reply>i answered another cc right before penacony but i stand by it after 2.0 😊 https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1341950496 <br><br>can’t promise anything, and a significant part of me would rather not dip into anything that brings me closer to the rot at the heart of that particular corner of hyv online communities, but the temptation is very much there, and especially now that i have so much canon info and interactions to work with. yet hsr is also my sacred little thinking space and idk if i want to taint that with my own writing, etc. we shall see, but thank you for asking.</div>

 <div class=reply>a belated happy new year! i have some mixed feelings about a certain group of… newsletter influencers? pop culture commentary people who have been afforded authority despite generally unoriginal content. so i refrain from indulging in substack-famous ones too much, but would definitely still recommend lists of popular ones on the site. <br><br>that said, i have a few substacks named here, if it’s okay for me to link back: https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1327590591 <br><br>i quite enjoy the tone of the musician flatsound’s personal newsletter, too: https://www.flatsound.org/blog. and i have been obsessed with zoe suen since the impressionable age of twelve and have been following her around since: https://floss.substack.com/</div>

 <div class=reply>happy 2024! oooh that’s a tricky one… maybe not overtly christmas-y, but i spent most of the christmases of my childhood between my grandparents and a school/group home run by nuns, so it was a lot of 4am masses and scalding oregano tea to wake me up and reruns of prince of egypt, which was the only film i was allowed to watch that was. idk. catholic enough? <br><br>i really enjoy the yuletide season in teenage/young adult life, though! many perfectly bittersweet memories of bonding with people in the cold and bookstore hopping trips and conversations that last until the streetcars are no longer running. otherwise, i usually just sleep through christmas and nye these days at my biological mother’s place. she always works on christmas and nye and i get to have a house all to myself. the days around it are often busy enough to sustain the celebratory energy: my friends do an annual powerpoint night, i get to visit schoolmates that moved to another province, lots of hot chocolate and fancy black tea and shortbread cookies. it’s a naturally quiet time for a naturally quiet disposition to thrive, so anything within this time period is celebration enough.</div>

 <div class=reply>a very late happy new year right back to you !!! i am months late to the greeting, but i am also wishing you love and comfort in turn 💗<br><br>i honestly just go with the flow, though! i don’t keep track of my firsts and lasts, new year or otherwise. too much going on in my life at any given moment, i think, but i’m probably just not very sentimental about naturally ephemeral things. i’ve tried to be aware of my first read of the year in the past, but it felt a little too much like being more bound to something than choosing it by intuitive attachment so i just. abandoned the endeavour entirely. i do try to listen to up the wolves by the mountain goats at some point at the start of the year, like a little hype song, but not to the degree that i need it as my first song. there are also poems and fragments that come to mind as the year is ending, but i find that my heart is steadier when it lets the natural passage of time act as time does rather than anchor it to equally transient landmarks.</div>

 <div class=reply>hmm… mostly bc i highly doubt it will ever happen, i think it’s not so much disgust as it is a simpler aversion? of course i would be flattered, and i’m sure i’m not immune to feeling validated and/or gratified by it, but i’d very likely just find a way to make sure i never stumble upon any pages/reviews/press about me even by accident. having the necessary words muted online and only looking at comments when i’m logged in is its own level of emotional labour as it is; i struggle to imagine having to manage that at a much bigger scale. i’m thankful enough right now as a fic writer to know there are conversations about my work that can exist outside of my own experience and accrue dedicated followings of their own via word of mouth, and it’s exactly bc of this that it’s the kind of gratitude best preserved and honoured with distance. that will remain true even if i were to become a “professional” writer. if that makes sense.<br><br>i also just don’t like the bureaucracy of having to be a person, let alone a person tied to writing. i don’t like being expected to champion my own writing, or to take pride in it on principle, or to use it in service of some overarching agenda, whether it’s pr/marketing or talking to press or having my info pieced together in a wikipedia page based off all the things i said in other places. being a famous/wikipedia-official writer implies much of that has had to take place, you know what i mean? <br><br>i guess i prefer to keep my relationship to craft untouchable — though not out of any sense of purity! or bc i consider myself especially talented, which i don’t, but bc i work best as myself, with myself. i prefer pursuing what i want exactly as i want within my current ability. anything that can intrude on that is unwanted. plus if one hinges their art and/or motivation on finite resources like public goodwill or attention or a self-brand, then the art and motivation itself will be finite, and thereby unreliable. there is only room for two heart-sized entities in a two-person dynamic, and that goes for a relationship with writing as well.<br><br>fame — by which people really mean increased visibility — isn’t the sort of thing you should let poison your objectivity and sense of self. if it befalls me, i’ll be grateful and will act according to duty, but it should change nothing with writing itself, nor should being witnessed be motivation if there is no truth in the performance. i’ll take great pains to ensure that, even if it means running off to some underwater cave to write 😓<br><br>sorry if this is pretentious omg i’m also gagging</div>

 <div class=question>hi, dear sha!<br><br>there are still some hours left until me and fellow contrymen greet the new year, but i can already hear some fireworks popping in the sky so close yet so far away and i feel like i could at least be a little bit self indulgent at the end of an year that wasn’t the kindest to me.<br><br>so (and by all means please don’t feel obliged to reply to this if you do not wish to think about them at the moment!) i would like to ask you if you ever thought about your flls itafushi during the holiday season. i have been thinking a lot about them lately and, after a december marked by heartbreak when the two of them were only 19 and so very young, there is something in me that believes they try their hardest to make all of their future holidays to be at least a little more gentle for themselves—as in something they owe their younger selves, you know? so i’d like to know if you ever thought about how itafushi would celebrate christmas and the greeting of a new year at 21 and onwards. do they spend it at the gojo-geto house? do they travel to a different city in japan or in another country? do they celebrate it with their friends at a bar (normal people style)? do they simply cook something for each other at their home, easing into the new year wine drunk, watching a movie while keeping an attentive eye on the clock only to make sure neither of them miss the second the clock turns midnight and they turn to each other to wish one another a happy new year with a kiss?<br><br>i just love them so, so much, sha. they mean the whole world to me and being at the threshold of a new and hopefully more gentle year, i feel it deep in my heart the need to thank you for creating that universe and for giving me something to hold onto in my hardest days. thank you, thank you, thank you. there’s so much gratitude in me and i hope sending an anon message through an online platform is able to convey at least 5% of that gratitude.<br><br>happy 2024 for you, my dearest sha, and for your itafushi. i hope this next year brings you happiness and kindness and pockets of warmth and love and peace.🌟🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>the word limit doesn’t leave me nearly enough space for all the love, gratitude &amp; apology i want to convey, but thank you, thank you, thank you—for minding my boundaries, for the well wishes, for caring about the flls world so deeply, and i am so sorry for taking so long to reply to such a heartfelt message. this means the universe to me. thank you.<br><br>i’m not immune myself to thinking about them during the holidays, funnily enough! flls yuuji played off having to spend the holidays with his friends, but i imagine there’s no shrugging off being the plus one, no matter how warm junpei’s mother or nobara’s grandmother might be. the warmth will always be an extension of someone else’s holiday ritual. i think... there’s a feeling of wholeness that comes naturally with ownership. it’s not like yuuji’s asking to be made complete by someone else’s family; the loss of his family will always be an unfillable blank. but having a ritual at all to call your own goes a long way with the flls boys, and as bittersweet as it must be for him to be fully integrated into megumi’s massive family, it’s also the closest he’s had in years to a stable home. that’s why the okinawa trip was so crucial, and why yuuji responded in kind by bringing megumi to his grandpa’s grave; megumi needed to show yuuji that he was wanted &amp; needed by his family, yes, but that this family is also yuuji’s bc it was megumi’s. <br><br>megumi &amp; gojo’s birthdays got buried by the wedding chaos in flls, but i like to think it’s a yearly Thing any other december, especially once all the youngest members of the family are living in different prefectures and tsumiki has a whole husband and kid. so the gojo-geto household will probably be bustling for days during the one week everyone can coordinate for time off, with one big christmas party on the 24th that geto &amp; megumi have to emotionally brace for each year. (there’s a blink in flls of maki &amp; yuuta generally hiding from the chaos by chilling in one of the rooms.) megumi &amp; nanako are bickering over tsumiki’s baby, gojo’s eating more than he is helping geto &amp; yuuji cook six dishes for 50+ guests, mimiko’s the only one free to answer the doorbell. the last guest (shoko) leaves at like 4am, at which point itfs are both warm from eggnog drinks, the company &amp; endless food. they get their best sleep of the year before driving back to chiba the next day drowsy &amp; full.<br> <br>i believe christmas day is more for romance than family in japan (part of megumi’s issue in their flls argument), and it’s probably hard to avoid being reminded of that one fight every year, but that’s also more reason for it to be Their day. they stay at home and heat up something from the mountain of tupperwares they brought back from the gojo-geto home and laze around peeling oranges for each other under the kotatsu. lazy kisses. quiet music. yuuji must have a list of christmas movies he makes megumi watch. which is to say yes, i think you have it dead-on with that final description ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>oh! i’ve never considered writing for hsr, now that you mention it. hsr is very, very good to me. every narrative train of thought and/or dynamic i could have turned to fic to pursue, they already pursued for me, even if in fragments. the existing fics in the tag are also surprisingly fulfilling for a primarily genfic reader like me, the fanart is great, the lore is more interesting than i could have ever produced from my tiny little brain. i’ve been having so much fun as it is, and penacony will probably give me even more food. <br><br>that said ☝️ i know myself and the lengths i will go to write a non-romantic dynamic i love into an au less monotonous for me than a short and simple study, so if i have to write aventio to put ratio, ruan mei, herta &amp; screwllum in the same room — you know i will. everyone has written all the high cloud quintet i could want. i have a playlist that i tear up to nightly. that’s all well and done. the nerds, though… and aventurine’s potential backstory based on what we know about how topaz joined the ipc and his tattoo… i think i’ll have a lot of fun with that. sometimes you hear a character speak for the first time and you snap your fingers and go — yep. you. you and my writing will get along swimmingly. that’s me with aventurine. i think i literally went “ohhhh you and i could have so much fun together” when we were introduced to him. i have a gut feeling about what vibes are waiting there, and i admit i’m itching to write something i haven’t done before.<br><br>i mean, i’d love nothing more than to write the slice of life au where everyone is alive and sane and dan heng is just rich ceo imbibitor lunae’s younger brother who’s in college and rooming with march, stelle and caelus — but i also know myself and the stuff that will interest current me to write. it’s really only aventio i can see fulfilling that prerequisite, i fear. do i like them like that? not quite yet. but with their lightcone and the temptation of a chronic gambler with a survival complex and a well-intentioned but temperamental professor having this loaded, complicated relationship — the fic’s basically written. it’s there. when i say fics emerge fully formed, this is what i mean. there’s fake marriage and guns and terrible nightmares and the difficulty of intimacy when you treat life as something to win and something to teach and be taught, respectively. i am also watching the new mr. and mrs. smith right now.<br><br>the tl;dr is: if i ever do write for hsr, it will probably be aventurine-ratio related. with a complicated genius society + ratio friendship. but it could very well be that hsr will have written the story for me by the time we’re done with 2.0. <br><br>(also: i liked the hunger games as a kid and still do. many thoughts; none original.)</div>

 <div class=reply>i am a shameless pirate-r of books haha (zlib, anna’s archive, vk, you know the usual sites), though partly bc i’m also a shameless buyer and borrower. something about it all balancing out in the economic system. which could or could not be true. lately, i’ve been trying out audiobooks as well thanks to spotify offering some free ones. still not a preferred format for me, personally, but the accessibility helps. <br><br>is it libby that you use to borrow from your local library? some people have also recommended hoopla, i believe… i’m sorry that i can’t offer more resources for legal access :(</div>

 <div class=question>Helloo Sha, maybe this is an awkward question so no worries if you can't answer. I can't recall from where but I remember reading that you found out you're someone who has to have a lot of alone time or something along those lines. something about living with people right? so sorry for my forgetfulness, it's alright if you can link me where you talked about this if it's no trouble. I recently moved to a different country for my studies and moved in with a friend. For the past 6 months, I kept thinking that maybe I would feel better living alone. I don't know. It's not a housemate problem directly, there are some points where we clash but nothing that drives me towards moving out. But I do want to. But then there's also the fact that I come from a place where living with your family is the norm even as adults, and its recommended because living prices are devastating. While I think that's lovely for some, I just don't think I've ever been someone who could handle that in my adult life. Everyone says I'm too influenced by the western world, but I just genuinely think me as a person, from my childhood to my identity, I'm just not someone who can live with religious family members. So I'm wondering, do I let myself have these 4ish years of living alone and then deal with the mourning of moving back with my family? I guess the main question is, do I let myself have something while fully knowing my time with it is limited? I don't know, my solitude means so much to me. I truly don't know the state of the economy my country will be in by then and if I can afford to move out maybe something will work out, but looking at current events i just don't have hope for it. But anyway, if it's alright I'd like your thoughts on it, thank you for your time Sha, hope your holidays are fun and comfy &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no no, you have nothing to apologize for. i must say things like that a lot. yesterday, i opened a fortune cookie that was like, “you have a basic need for solitude.” and i was like. well yes! basic need was a surprisingly perfect way of putting it. i just can’t stand having to be with people in the same way i can’t stand being hungry. i live with quite a few, but my room is in a basement that’s basically a separate unit, and everyone kind of understands that i’ll just never be the kind of housemate that seeks out company. whether it’s going to the movies, concerts, plays, the amusement park — i’ve always had more fun going to things by myself. so in some regard, i might be a more extreme case. <br><br>my point is that i fully empathize with where you’re coming from, and let me tell you that — even if you love your family and have a healthy relationship with them — if you have the opportunity to try living by yourself, i would take it. especially knowing you might never get this chance again. it isn’t even a question to me. i absolutely would take it, in your shoes. you ask a really great question, about letting yourself have a taste of something good if a taste is all it will be, but i personally live life seeing everything as limited. there’s always a finite amount of things. the lack of infinity is in itself infinite. to me, that means it’s never reason enough to not pursue something. sure, there will be moments where you have to quit something before it’s even begun bc the end will come too soon, like relationships and career paths, but that’s a matter of resources that might be best preserved if you decline something that would deplete it. in this case, staying with your family when you have the chance to not IS depleting your resources as much as living separately will have its own costs. might as well choose the costly thing that comes with some pros, if you ask me. <br><br>there will always be norms wherever you go, whatever you do, and statistically speaking, there’s no way you won’t break a few in your life. you might as well stop tracking which ones, is what i always think. it’s hard, when loving yourself means choosing that love over the duty and obligation we feel towards family, and i acknowledge that that’s a corner of my life that i learned to harden my heart to and can’t speak to your own experience, but on the base level, none of that weighs as much as not choosing air if it’s offered to you after a life underwater. basic need for solitude, right? <br><br>some friends have told me they only learned to love their family once they started living on their own, which i’ve always found curious. i wouldn’t go as far as to promise you that. but i do know that experiences will always be limited. that’s exactly why we choose them when we have the opportunity to. you don’t have to help the universe limit them. but this is just what i think; i’m in your corner no matter what you choose, and truly wish you all the best.</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s wild you ask about these pairings specifically bc i have both of them muted to the moon and back :( it’s weird, you’d think being a rnbcis-ist would make at least rinsagi appeal to me but unfortunately it just. doesn’t. i often think that chemistry / writing characters is a matter of balancing formulas, and i just can’t see a well-written or interesting rnis romantically. kaisagi Does have potential, and there’s a particular flavour of their dynamic i would like to see, but i rarely ever encounter it in the people who like them together. i’ve found it’s just safer to have both these pairings out of sight, out of mind. <br><br>i think it’s also that… sometimes you see a popular pairing and can sense what sort of characterization must be driving the popularity in Some part. i personally see nothing in the canon material that generates any chemistry worth pursuing. i see why they have a following, but i just find both… stale? and very, very prone to the kind of mischaracterization that makes me a bit unkind bc if you’re gonna like these characters and ship them bc of that then why are they not acting like themselves, you know? with pairings, boring to write is often unfortunately boring to think about in the first place. i like a bit more friction in my pairings, and i admit i’m very easy to lose otherwise, no matter (or maybe especially) if appealing tropes are involved.<br><br>tl;dr: there will always be people who find pairings like these two appealing, and i guess i’m just not very fun in that regard. but it’s not personal. i also don’t mean to sound pretentious or judgy about it. i just… am careful to a fault about the dynamics i circle around, both in my media and the literal relationships and rhythms you gotta be wary of within fandoms. these two pairings don’t quite make the cut, and to prevent myself from being maybe uncharitable about that, it’s best to just have the pairings far away from where i can bite.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have not :( i’ve had the first book/volume queued on my ipad for so long now bc my algorithm loves to recommend it again and again (maybe bc sci-fi is one of my most consumed genres…?) but i just. have never gotten around to finishing the final arc of my current uber-long web novel. i also need to read lord of the mysteries at some point. god. so much potentially great stuff to consume, so little free time. <br><br>little mushroom is very much on my radar, though! i wonder what about it is so reminiscent of hairpin turns? not that you have to answer — i’ve heard only good things about little mushroom so this is quite the honour, thank you. i’m relieved to hear my first foray into genre fiction can hold up even a tiny bit 😓</div>

 <div class=question>i love your perspective on sae. he’s such an interesting character. a lot of people view sae as somewhat of a tragic character, assuming that something happened to him in spain that made him change his course but i don’t really feel that way although i respect that too. i like sae because i find him interesting as i said previously and also kind of mysterious? like he hasn’t come up in the manga in a bit but he has a silent presence imo. he’s also just cunty icl 😭 what abt him caught your eye?</div>

 <div class=reply>no exactly !! one thing about sae is that he will serve !! never seen a character so allergic to not getting what he wants. even if he has to destroy self esteem and a relationship and a half in the process.<br><br>sae is like… if the heir to the throne of a nation with much at stake and a history of turning against their kings were to suddenly abdicate the line of succession and decide that instead of putting his genius to governing a nation that feels entitled to his skills, he’ll look for a monarch willing to go the mile for their own people and act as a cutthroat advisor to them. what i loved first about sae is his palpable desire to not be part of the Japanese Soccer narrative; he refuses to belong to japan. they can call him japan’s treasure, they can glorify his skills, but none of these are necessary nor even a testament to his own evaluation of his worth and talent. people read this as secret self-deprecation, but sae isn’t blind to his own competence. there is nothing in this boy’s mind but football; he’s never had a life without and outside of it. he loves the sport, and so he values people who are dogged about their pursuit and love of it. <br><br>shidou only warmed up to sae when he realized he didn’t just talk a big game — that sae was actually good, and that he expects shidou to be as well. they wouldn’t accept each other if they were giving any less of their absolute best to football. i think characterization of sae thrives with that in mind: that this is a guy who loves his spreadsheets and his data, bc he wants to know exactly what he’s working with and not the fluff and facades of people’s personal bullshit. he wants results, and he wants them as perfect as you can give, even if you’re not sure of what that looks like yourself. he doesn’t care. he wants it, and you better want it, too. he’s willing to ask for the same thing from himself, and to coach unpolished gems like shidou into giving more of himself bc he Knows shidou can. <br><br>idk. i love that sae’s self-preserving above all, and that he’s uncompromising. he’s not immoveable to criticism bc he believes he’s beyond reproach; whatever problems you can levy against sae, he has already foreseen and addressed them. i love that he hates the institution of soccer (in the scene where aiku asks him to give up shidou, his first reply is to make sure aiku’s asking as the u20 captain and not bc of “the adults in the association”) but loves the sport unequivocally. i love that he was about to leave the u20 match after making sure rin is fine, but couldn’t help staying when aiku said he can have his pet demon for the remaining half. it’s not quite freedom if it’s a cage of your own making, but if you ask me, sae seems just fine with his own trajectory. whatever tragedies are there are already set in stone, but there’s a lot of stubbornness in him making sure that the same system that champions players like his brother do not do so at the cost of players like shidou. it’s so fascinating.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have… a soft spot… for the when harry met sally confession scene: <br><br>“I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.”<br><br>it’s a flawed movie that doesn’t rank in my top three romcoms of all time (bringing up baby, 10 things i hate about you + say anything), but nora ephron is The romance writer, i can’t deny it. the amount of knowing in that confession. the amount of observing. the implicit “this is who you are to me, and i love you, and this is who i’ll spend the rest of my life with. not bc i’m lonely and you’re who’s available, but bc it’s you.” <br><br>not really a confession scene, but since i already brought up say anything, my favourite lloyd line is: “Maybe I didn't really know you. Maybe you were just a mirage. Maybe the world is full of food and sex and spectacle and we're all just hurling towards an apocalypse, in which case it’s not your fault.” and my favourite diane line: “Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die. I love you.” <br><br>persuasion by jane austen has the ultimate exes dynamic: “You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.” <br><br>my all-time fav romance arc is kim gongja and raviel ivansia from sss-class revival hunter, but if i shared all my fav confessions between them, i’ll be far over the word limit. a few are: <br><br>— “Perhaps it’s hypocritical, but I wanted to let you know that I’m here, thinking of you and protecting you. If I can just manage that, how blessed would it be?”<br><br>— “I’m happy to be with you. It would be an exaggeration to say I lived this life just to meet you, but it isn't a lie to say I'll live for you. What a relief. I could say that without a single lie.” <br><br>— “Are you listening? I am happy because of you. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to let go of the time I've spent with you like this. [...] I want to see your days. I want to say goodnight to you. Your days will surely make me smile, and evenings with you will be happy. I want my smile and your happiness to overlap.” <br><br>i don’t read many romance novels, i realize... mostly romance movies and manhwas, of which i’m sure i have many other fav scenes. but these are all i got for now, tysm for the charming question 🥰</div>

 <div class=reply>yessssss i love triads partly bc i find them so fulfilling to read/write, full stop, and partly bc i think they’re a fascinating look at just. the politics and poetics of relationships. insert all the necessary caveats about how a pretence of “polyamory” has been used in harmful ways by individuals in power dynamics that serve them more than their partner, but that’s not what i’m looking for in a triad. i’ve always been of the opinion that no one person should shoulder the onus of being our capital p Person, and that to work off that expectation and need is to compromise what can make a relationship fulfilling in the first place. i mean, obviously, relationships shouldn’t be subjected to asset valuation like they’re stocks, but in a way, they Are chemical formulas to me. you can’t leave unstable ones alone, bc they’ll always be in danger of exploding, of corroding, of being a hazard, etc. but stable chemical equations make up the world we live in, and a healthy relationship should always have the ability and agency to stabilize itself. that’s true even in fiction. sometimes the stabilizing factor is a third person. something you’re both your best selves bc you love this third person, and they love you both, and you love each other through the love only possible bc three people are powering it into existence. <br><br>maybe it’s bc i don’t understand romance, i get that, but i think it’s possible to love more than one person. maybe the degrees vary, as does the nature of the love, but i’m just really interested in the kinds of dynamics possible with three people in the equation. rnbcis is such a good example mostly bc canon already makes them a triad. rin and isagi as mirrors of the outer self, bachira and rin as mirrors of the inner self, bachira and isagi as the bridge between all three. once you cut away all the running gags of isagi not knowing how rnbc can have chemistry with each other and the angst of both rnbc and rnis, all three of them have something to learn about love, desire &amp; selfhood in giving and receiving from one another. more, i would argue, than in their pairing iterations. why would i deny them the best that this love could be? <br><br>i don’t always think that about triads, to be fair. it has to make sense as much as any pairing has to make sense. just bc there’s more people to divide the work of a relationship across doesn’t mean the work isn’t what it is. that said, i know people say trios don’t work, but is that really the inherent fault of the number or the people in it? love is hard work, everything is a choice, etc. why is being in a triad any different? i think there’s immense fun in seeing love as a bigger circle. when it makes sense, it’s an irreplaceable kind of fulfillment, and an infinite kind of love. at least i think so.</div>

 <div class=question>helloooo sha, what should you do if the love for writing isn’t there anymore? is writing something that should still be done as a chore to eventually revive that love?<br>i used to read things and marvel at sentence structures and metaphors and all the brilliant connotations etc etc but it’s not as potent these days anymore. part of me mourns this but part of me is thinking maybe i’m just. happier? or. at least able to stomach life better? at the very least there’s no need to turn to writing as refuge anymore… <br>though i will say that after watching the boy and the heron, that sparked something in me that i still haven’t fully figured out&lt;3 who knows..<br>thanks for your thoughts, hope you’re having a good day/night!</div>

 <div class=reply>i think… if love for writing isn’t there anymore, and you’re writing anyway, then that must mean it’s not for love that you’re writing — right? is that fair for me to say? bc with that angle in mind, i don’t think doing something without love can ever be an act i would encourage in such totality. there are things you’ll have to do even when they feel like a chore, lives to live where love won’t be enough to change how difficult it is, but if writing doesn’t have to be one of them, then no, i don’t think you should keep trying. or rather, i don’t think you should keep trying to resurrect love that isn’t there anymore. you can’t get back something that has died; it will always be a shadow of its former self, if not like. a mutated abomination. in place of what you think you’re reviving. you can’t ever find something else to be what it was to you, bc there’s no replacing a love that was real under only a specific set of factors. what writing meant to you once, if it’s truly dead — let it go, breathe, and take a step back, is what i would say. <br><br>but that doesn’t mean a new love won’t form in the future. that you’ll return to writing someday and find that you miss it, and the missing it is as intense as loving it, and that there’s the beginning of a new kind of love there. writing will never be inaccessible to you. ever. it will be there if ever you choose to return. even when you’re 80 and you find that the reason writing started feeling like a chore is bc the limited attention span and constant screen &gt; page approach of the 2020s got to you — you can always revisit writing then. stories don’t die, whether yours or someone else’s. the less of them we get in today’s world, the more we want them, whether or not we realize that’s what it is. i think that will always be true, bc it’s a truth that will change with us, you know? <br><br>i also think that just bc you feel it’s time to let writing go right now doesn’t mean you’re severing your tie to art, nor to whatever craft might mean to you at any point. i know it’s bittersweet to end a relationship where the love fizzled out, but too much love can burn anyone out, maker or receiver. if writing was a refuge and to hold onto it is to stubbornly hold onto the you that needed that refuge — i think writing will be glad to know it’s no longer needed. it’s a difficult stance to decide on, but i’d rather art be unnecessary bc its ability to be a balm is no longer needed than for it to be trapped at our beck-and-call for functions that aren’t natural to it. you should never insist on keeping something with the prerequisite that it must be unconditionally worth keeping.<br><br>i know that i should probably be telling you to hold onto writing, that this is the more human, emotional approach to it — but i really do believe it’s fine to let go when you feel it’s time. just as i think it’s okay to be happy, and that it’s okay to have a life beyond the thing that ensure you get to keep that life once. if that makes sense.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha&lt;3<br>coming to you abt this feels a bit like the start of flls where an anon asks a question abt love but i hope you’ll indulge me anyhow hehe<br>recently i’ve met someone and i don’t feel any need for pretense around them.. even when we first started talking, there was a level of comfortability that bordered on familiarity, and as someone with audhd that is very hard to come by… not to mention they’re beautiful with a love for birds (i call them dove and i am thankful to be able to) and they enjoy philosophy and sociology and i think so very much that they are lovely<br>all of this to say that even though i think this, even though whenever i see them i want to turn myself inside out if only to be more entire with them, i’m struggling to get past the confines of my body. we have both expressed our feelings towards each other but are both terribly awful with initiating affection… though i don’t know if my hesitancy comes from never having a rs before on any level, physical or intimate, or if it’s because they’ve expressed that they know no bounds between platonic and romantic love. i agreed i was okay with it because i do think i am (i thought i was aromantic for a looong time and a traditional relationship sounds too much to me), but part of me—only sometimes, and very fleetingly—would like to be each other’s only one. <br>and now, as it is winter break, we are back in our hometowns but i am God Awful at texting. like. awful. it’s embarrassing to admit! and the age old habit of wanting to disconnect/isolate is coming back…. is there something to be noted about how i want to run away from those i love? i feel like i’m missing something and i want to take myself by the shoulders and shake them until epiphany. it’s frustrating. <br><br>idk what’s going on or what i hope to even achieve by sending you this but i am a bit confused and would appreciate any insight you have if you have any time&lt;3<br><br>thank you sha!</div>

 <div class=reply>“i call them dove and i am thankful to be able to” 🥹<br><br>hmmm i admit i’m not good at conceptualizing the parameters of being someone’s one partner — but i think your desire for it, no matter how small or latent, is most important. there’s no shame in trying to figure things out slowly. there’s no dominant expectation of intimacy, physical or otherwise, that should be governing your relationship with anyone to the point that you would compromise what either of you feel. what’s real will always be what’s between you two, and that must always take precedence over abstracted things like what you’re supposed to be doing at what stage of what kind of relationship. <br><br>i do worry a bit bc i don’t want you to agree with the other party purely bc it’s what they want. not to say that i doubt whether your agreement is in fact genuine !! i just think that when we’re in relationships, we tend to take into consideration other people’s desires when we evaluate our own. that’s good, it’s what makes a relationship “successful,” but only if the other person is doing the same for you. no matter how fleeting or infrequent your desire to reframe your dynamic might be, it’s still worth bringing up, bc the other person won’t know otherwise. and if they don’t feel like that changes anything, or just go along without voicing any strong feelings of their own — then i would consider it a call to reevaluate. <br><br>but i Am being extremely hard on your dove. i promise i’m not approaching this with skepticism against them, just that when entering new relationships, there might be things that feel like you shouldn’t or shouldn’t Have To bring up and/or explore with their input. but relationships are always two-way, i’m afraid, and no matter how comfortable or familiar it might feel with someone, they’ll never be able to truly read your mind, nor you theirs. that’s all. i’m not saying to walk in there and voice a desire that isn’t too clear to you at the moment either! i just think you can be forgiven for prodding and testing the waters here and there. (it might also help to get a clearer idea of what love languages you both prefer, giving and receiving.) <br><br>re: a tendency towards an avoidant attachment style... when we want to disconnect/isolate, i think it’s often primarily a desire to be left alone. the difference is crucial. do you want to be left alone bc you feel that you’re losing your grip on yourself when you’re always connected to others? is it bc the enormity of someone else’s needs scare you? is it bc the enormity of Your own needs is daunting and you’d rather disregard it rather than go through the ordeal of meeting them? the thing that you feel you’re missing — is it lack, or is anxiety at knowing something is expected of you and you’re not meeting it? <br><br>these are questions i shouldn’t answer for you, ofc, and i know i’m spouting out like. basic introspection. but i really wish all the best for you, and i hope this helped even a miniscule bit :(</div>

 <div class=reply>oooohhh the only book to ever make me actually cry is kite runner by khaled hosseini haha that one changed the trajectory of my life at the ripe age of seven <br><br>i don’t know if i’ll cry for it now, though! it might strike me more gimmick-y than it felt when i was a kid. i cried a lot at the end of sea of tranquility by emily st. john mandel, but it wasn’t really about the story so much as having to end that particular reading experience, you know? other books that have tugged at my heartstrings in recent memory were the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne and the employees by olga ravn, the former of which is way too long and the latter (i think) more subjective than objectively sad. <br><br>some authors on my bookshelf that i know have invited tears from readers would probably be: mieko kawakami (heaven seems to be a heavy read, but so is anything in her oeuvre); han kang (maybe the white book?); min jin lee (pachinko! though another long read) and ian mcewan (the atonement movie seems to be a big tearjerker, so i imagine its source must be equally so). <br><br>that said, i also know people who have cried over books like a little life, song of achilles, if we were villains and seven husbands of evelyn hugo, if that’s your cup of tea… i personally hate all four books, but i do think there’s merit in stories that are specifically designed to make the reader cry, especially if that’s exactly what someone needs.<br><br>i’m just. not a good litmus test for tearjerkers. i’m really incredibly sorry.</div>

 <div class=question>Hey! I just wanted to pop in and say that I love your writing! I remember reading first love late spring when I was still heartbroken over my first and only love. The experiences that you wrote about reflected how we felt - neither of us knew how to set the boundaries we needed to. It was intense and too much but so so beautiful as being in love for the first time when you're 17 and stupid goes. Thank you for putting this piece for us to experience. You've captured that feeling of being in love for the first time and how enormous and scary it is. <br><br>I'm with someone new now, and reading this fic and "some kind of we" two years later, it also captures the feeling of having grown and learned and now, choosing to take the leap into choosing to love someone without the baggage of trying to understand my own heart first. I can't say that I'm in love with him yet. But I know we're building a life together, and this is just the beginning.</div>

 <div class=reply>the fact that you thought of dropping by two years later to tell me this — there’s no word for the exact cocktail of awe and gratitude. thank you so much for taking the time to share with me your thoughts and feelings both as a person and as a reader… i always find myself musing over the things that have been supposedly captured in flls and thinking they were epiphanies i wouldn’t ever wish on someone. there’s plenty of… fascination? in me? to know something so painful can also be beautiful for the people in love, especially at an age where we don’t even know that we Can choose, let alone what those choices might look like. it must be terrifying. it must be heartrending. the fact that people willingly leap for it nonetheless, and that that’s something i can have the privilege of trying to approximate somehow in fiction — it means a lot to me. it never gets old receiving messages like this. i’m glad you are at a beginning of your own, and honoured that my own words could have been a tiny, tiny part of the journey there ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>i mean who isn’t !! even writers for the new york times have watched the anime. it sports animanga’d so hard it basically ended the genre as we’ll ever know it. like madoka to the magical girl genre. icon. <br><br>about writing, though, i hope it’s okay for me to link another recent answer here: https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1339864741 <br><br>the tl;dr is that i’ve exhausted any desire to write for it through old, old, old fics of a bygone era and unfinished wips, and now i’m just happy to chill and watch the energetic hq enjoyers from my balcony like a parade passing by with my own book and cup of tea.</div>

 <div class=reply>yes ofc! it’s so interesting you say that bc i’d actually say before sunrise is closer to us (the fic) in vibes than to flls, but also — have you seen before sunset? the second movie in that trilogy? it was one of the films i rewatched when i was stuck on the last chapter of flls. idk how strong the influence ultimately ended up, let alone if it’s even palpable to a reader, but even now i can think of some scenes after the timeskip that were birthed by some elements/dialogue pieces in before sunset that caught my attention. <br><br>in any case, it’s a huge honour to hear this comparison, especially since before sunset is probably one of my fav films of all time !! to know the vibes are even remotely similar to its predecessor is a big compliment — so thank you, thank you, thank you.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh dear thank you so much for your kind thoughts, but please don’t say that about yourself omg there’s no objective way that’s true !!<br><br>and ahhh this is a weird answer but i think… i already did my time with haikyuu back in 2014 and i’m not really too keen on going back. i know readers from my yuri on ice days managed to track those old fics down in another corner of the internet, and i don’t mind at all considering i still have some hq wips from like. 2020. but as i am right now, while i’ll always have immense fondness for hq, it doesn’t... stimulate me enough? mentally or emotionally? for me to consider writing for it, if that makes sense. plus the fandom is active enough as it is that i’m sure i’ll have nothing to contribute of any value whatsoever.<br><br>i’m very sorry to disappoint, but thank you so much for the sentiment 🩷</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, i don’t know if i would ever go as far as to say that about myself, truly, but you are extremely kind, thank you. how do i put it — you know how richard siken writes, in the same poem, that “to make something / beautiful should be enough. it isn’t. it should be.” but also “who am i? i’m just a writer. i write things down.” that’s me, all the time, except i won’t even consider myself a writer. just a guy who writes. sometimes. <br><br>again, thank you sincerely, and i hope winter is kind with your heart 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>hi! a lot of lost relationships, reading, and cagy back-and-forth, mostly. i always hesitate to say it was difficult bc i also understand all the caveats of the full umbrella of queerness vs. asexuality/aromanticism and the safety of non-expression, etc. but it definitely hasn’t been straightforward. <br><br>i’m terrible at articulating my own feelings, but i guess i’ve always been… what The Communities would call romance repulsed. giving and receiving romantic love / participating in romance in any way came with — claustrophobia? in a way? like being buried alive in a coffin underground. but “logical” arguments were So available that i didn’t initially see the depth of that feeling: is it bc i grew up without love of any kind, let alone good examples of romantic dynamics? is it bc i’m self-sufficient and solitude-loving by nature, and i just find it hard to co-exist with another person in the traditional context? is it bc i’m protective and private with even my emotional energy? is it bc i haven’t found someone i’m compatible with? is it bc i was participating in comphet for longer than i’ve been aware of the parameters of my gender &amp; sexuality? is it all just bc i’m emotionally unavailable? <br><br>there’s so much you can psychologize, but also — in a way, it’s always been total for me. that’s not a privilege others have, i realize, but no matter how close i can bring myself with effort, it never traverses that final, crucial line. you could hold a knife to my pulse, give me a lobotomy, and it will still never be being In Love. if it was as easy as wishing it into reality, i would; it would have spared me from an abysmal track record of breaking hearts and losing friends i loved in my own way bc i couldn’t reproduce their version of it. but the what it is vs. what it isn’t was really all i had, and still is. it has helped me a lot to have a method of evaluation. i know romantic love is impossible exactly bc deep platonic love has been. i know romantic attraction is impossible exactly bc i go through periods of strictly physical attraction. i thought i had crushes, but then i sift through what i like about people and always find that romance is never part of the equation. ofc that isn’t always true for other aromantic people, i get that it’s a spectrum, but as with my relationship with gender: in theory, it’s all; in practice, none.<br><br>for what it’s worth: if it might help to see your experience Potentially reflected somewhere, here are some manga with aro/ace spectrum characters: https://x.com/nyoomzz/status/1642919362133893121?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw (is love the answer? by isaki uta especially is like. a collection of journal articles in the form of a manga.) i also hear good things about the themes explored in loveless by alice oseman and the anthology common bonds, edited by claudie arseneault.<br><br>i’m really sorry i don’t have a clearer, steadier answer. with all my heart, i hope you find a path that makes the most sense for you.</div>

 <div class=reply>hmm. complete and casual ambivalence? i don’t… really find… either of their characters… interesting. regardless of the nuances of their dynamic together and their respective backstories, that doesn’t really change even as a pairing. i understand why kaiser must exist in the story, it’s nice that his second is a character like ness, and i’m sure people have written treatises on the layers of that relationship, but i am just. snoozing in total tranquility. there’s no shortage of depth among the bastard münchen guys and i respect that, take your time kings, but i’m afraid it’s not an alarm clock i’ll get out of bed for.</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh how serious are we talking? there’s a newsletter thingy where i ramble a bit about how bllk is built upon a premise that actively goes against the collectivism bootlicking of most sports animes/manga, and how it reflects a shift in the wider genre altogether in a way that has already happened with shounen, blah blah blah. it’s mostly me talking to myself, but it’s here if you’re interested: https://cherrypick.substack.com/p/the-sports-manga-network <br><br>as for general thoughts… i think it’s an incredibly fun series, even if it likes a slow burn as much as it sometimes hits you with a full throttle when you just want it to calm down. when it delivers, it comes with an irreplaceable high. plus there are so many unexpected themes to tear apart and poke at. i adore how much kaneshiro and nomura clearly love the cast, how these characters are real to them and they want them to be real to us. it Can at times be to the detriment of the reading experience when there are characters you just don’t care about yet are forced to stay with — but i think i still prefer that than having a full cast of loveable, empathetic characters where no one really colours outside the lines. it’s nice to have such variety in the emotions i feel towards different characters; i think bllk might be the only piece of work on my current roster i can say that about, and i value that much. so many characters i love and want the best for, so many others i make a face at every time they’re mentioned, but i don’t think i’ll have it any other way. nowhere else are characters allowed to be as unapologetically unhinged and still be beloved by the story without some kind of lesson embedded in their backstory. it almost doesn’t matter where people come from, in bllk. behaviours and motivations can be explained, but none of it changes the fact that these are people who have been fundamentally and dysfunctionally changed by their circumstances, and the story itself is not blameless in that. characters are unhinged bc of the story, but they are also in the story bc they were unhinged to begin with, even characters like kunigami. bllk just feels like a night drive down an empty highway, several notches above the speed limit and radio blasting out an open window. there’s a thrill in the chaos of it and in the joy it gives you. it’s just super fun that way, and it’s a special kind of love when i do love it. really just unlocked something in what i find delightful. <br><br>sorry, maybe that’s a little too general. i know i answered some pairing-related ccs earlier this year but i also dread scrolling back that far so for what it’s worth my top five characters, in order, would probably be sae &gt; bachira &gt; shidou &gt; nagi &gt; rin, my fav arc is the u20 match, my fav dynamic is the birthday quartet (the itoshis, bachira &amp; shidou) and my underrated fav is maybe karasu.</div>

 <div class=reply>not at all !! this is so so thoughtful, actually, thank you :( never enough gratitude for all the people who take the time to read through so many of my words, really, but for all that it is worth, thank you very much. <br><br>i’m the same, actually — not that i don’t value the product, but it is definitely secondary to the process. i find that it’s difficult for me to love the result if i hated the process, so i spend quite a bit of conscious energy trying to make the process something to love. like a little loophole. so it means a lot to know there are people who would be interested in that. in thoughts that are in-progress, in ideas that have been abandoned, in choices they can very well ignore bc they have the complete end result and have no use for the fragments of what came before. it’s a kind of attention/kindness that i feel is a privilege to receive. so. i know this sounds like me trying to earn an uno reverse, but it’s thanks to people like you that i get to share blog posts like that and answers like this in the first place. <br><br>i also hope your winter is being gentle with you and your heart 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! <br><br>hope you're doing alright. it's holiday season!! i have sold my soul to bookbinding and typesetting and comicbooks. do you read them? if i so, who's your favorite character/favorite comic, if not, i totally see you as a tim drake fan.<br><br>i've messaged for writing advice before and i love reading your bits and have genuinely taken some of your advice (including one long ago about how you write dialogue first? literally saved me from deleting a few drafts i had). i've begun to touch on one of the fics I had on the brain for a while and just try and force myself to add to my ao3. i know i see some fics and it's like "wow this is their first fic and it's perfection" so that's still a hurdle i'm trying to get over. i'm not jealous, at least not like i probably was (but kept denying) at 15-17 but i'm stricken with the feeling that maybe my writing might never be at the level of readably i want. i genuinely want to write only for me because i come up with some nice ideas, and try to flesh them out for a while but they end up ideas at the end of the day. i'm sorry i don't have a lot else to say, i think that's just something i wanted to get off my chest. <br><br>in other news, i wanted to learn how to write/understand nsfw in fic, so i thought "huh, maybe if i had casual sex this would make a lot more sense." and then i went out and had sex (tmi but this all comes together i promise) and it was easier than i thought it would be. i had myself fully pegged as someone that would only do it with someone i was in a relationship with, but i went to a party, this guy asked, he looked decent and i'm like, okay. let's do it. granted i had a little liquid courage, but not enough for me to be out of my mind. i read somewhere (in a zosan fic HA) about sex being more an activity than something absolutely necessary in a relationship and after reading those words sex it a lot more understandable. i also thought i'd crave it with the right person, or i'd be super hypersexual enough dire circumstances and those circumstances means i need a boyfriend or something to mellow me out, but it's not like that at all (for me). i'm happy doing it once a month like, how it feels going to the movies or your favorite store. i'm surprised though, i keep hearing stories about less than stellar experience and quite stressful for others so I consider myself extremely lucky i found a gentle, respectful guy. but then after it happened, he parted ways and it felt nothing like the fics i've read my whole life. so i've started writing and realized i liked the build up to it a lot more than act itself, and when i apply the advice i see a lot about dissecting works i enjoy, it's like maybe a paragraph about the actual sex and 10k-20k of the build up. fjdksl i told you it would make sense (sort of).</div>

 <div class=reply>this a wild ride of a message omg but you are sooo real... i can’t speak much on the personal benefits of relationships, plus i’ve gone to ridiculous lengths to also hyper-control my experience with sexual intimact, but i am very glad you found someone respectful and that a situation like that (which could have easily gone south tsk tsk please take care of yourself) prompted more reflection than regret. that in itself is more precious than we often realize in the moment, i think. <br><br>that aside, i’m just a casual comic enjoyer who loves matt fraction’s hawkeye run. i was super ride or die for the young avengers once, too, but now i’m just heartbroken about the mcu ruining everything they didn’t even have to touch. i have a shelf dedicated to only comics/manga — but majority of them are non-serial works, and will constitute prob a whole cc reply. i techhhnically haven’t checked out anything specific to tim drake, but you’re far from the first person to say that about him (and the batfam, adjacently) which is so intriguing !! it hasn’t happened... Yet. perpetually pending.<br><br>i’m relieved at least one tip helped !! as for envy... i actually think it can be a healthy driver. partly bc i don’t think an emotion like jealousy — let alone envy, which i’d argue is much more potent bc there’s something you actively want that is someone else’s — is really up to us to will away. i saw this post the other day where an author was like (paraphrasing heavily here) “the sooner you let go of jealousy of other writers, the freer you will feel.” i don’t disagree, but i feel like — sometimes you envy someone and it functions as a ruler of the distance you have to traverse. you’re aware of the distance now and it must suck, but to be aware of what you are not is to also be given facilities to better shape what will get you to the other side. insert ira glass’ famous spiel about the creative taste gap. i think lack of envy/ability to compare yourself to another can put you in danger of stagnation more than you think. <br><br>the real big boss of anyone’s relationship with writing is when you start treating it like an abusive stage parent to a child actor. greedy, strict, controlling, unreasonable, etc. if envy makes you that person, if it becomes a conduit not for a desire to be better, be different, be new, but for unconditional hatred and unrealistic expectations — then that’s its own dead end. idk. there’s that one quote that’s like. let us love our limitations, bc without them, nobody would be left to become somebody. is it fair to ask to whose weaknesses i owe my strengths? whose strengths owe themselves to my weaknesses? even though it’s never in stasis anyway. that’s why it’s important to love the process more than the result. you love the thing that’s ever-changing and you never hate it For changing. <br><br>this msg felt like a facetime call tysm i am wishing you the loveliest winter of bookbinding ahead ❄️</div>

 <div class=reply>hello! lit recs as in fiction? the immediate ones to come to mind are sea of tranquility by emily st. john mandel, how high we go in the dark by sequoia nagamatsu, this is how you lose the time war by amal el-mohtar &amp; max gladstone, mr. fox by helen oyeyemi, and recursion by blake crouch, though none are exclusively about alternate universes so much as adjacent facets of the space-time continuum and stories separated and/or divided by those. but they all explore time and the possibilities that branch out from one choice, for better or for worse, so inevitably they all pull in themes we might relate more to overt universe jumping. blake crouch also has a book called dark matter, which i haven’t read but has been in the back of my mind since i read recursion exactly bc it deals with parallel worlds more directly. <br><br>if you meant lit as in any kind of literature, nonfiction included, i’ve had a mild intellectual crush on dr. michio kaku since childhood and have to jump at the chance to drop his work on parallel worlds somewhere so… my personal fav is his book on hyperspace, but it deals primarily with higher dimensions in physics and only talks about the possibility of parallel worlds closer to the end. he does have one book dedicated to the multiverse theory, where he talks about the everett interpretation and even the potential of us as a species being able to open up a path and travel to a younger version of our universe. it’s super Super cool, and i think more accessible than where he starts us off in hyperspace, even if it is still a work on quantum physics. <br><br>idk if these are somewhere along what you were looking for but i hope at least one of them provides a useful jumping off point for your search 😢</div>

 <div class=reply>this is not a question i ever thought i’ll get omg has the new season been rough ?? i can’t say i’ve thought about writing for it tbh but i hold matthew incredibly close to heart and definitely won’t say no if the mood strikes. i’d have a lot of fun with a sculptor… with lost memories, too, right? last i heard about season two? or something along those lines? but at the same time i’m sure there’s already a fair amount of content from the creator as well as within fandom spaces, considering how famous utgl is; i doubt there’s anything for me to contribute that isn’t already covered somewhere in a lot less words. so. i’m certainly turning it over in my head now, though i can’t promise anything.</div>

 <div class=reply>no no you are not wrong at all, it’s probably the only trope i know for a fact i’ll eat up in most iterations 😓<br><br>there’s this poem by nicole homer that’s like: “i loved someone / and i failed at it. let me say it / another way: i like to call myself wound / but i will answer to knife.” and i think that sums up a lot of what i love about exes dynamics. the concept of failing to love someone, yet to also be maimed by that failure yourself. there’s this redirection cycle of energy that any relationship between two people has, and it isn’t as if this energy just dissipates into nothing once the relationship ends. it just takes on new form, or finds a way to stay dormant without being absent totally; no matter where you go, no matter who you love in any way, there will always be this one person with whom you were under a specific social contract and there will always be a piece of you that was only true within the confines of that relationship for better or for worse. it’s sickening. it’s nauseating. it’s perfect for writing characters, bc no one else knows you like someone you have both hurt and been hurt by. there’s vulnerability there that might not even be fair, but even that bias in perception alone is such a valuable piece to have in the narratives we form about ourselves. when you have to ask: do you miss this person bc you loved them, or can you simply not get over the fact that you were never and might never be able to make it right with them? that someone might always carry “failed”/knife/wound version of you? do you miss the relationship, or the version of you that one dynamic necessitated? is the hatred you feel for this ex about them, or about you, how you fell for it, how they broke your heart, how you can’t put yourself back together and hey, no one person should have this much power over another? there is So much you can unpack in the intensity of that knowing. we frame relationships that have ended as failed relationships; i don’t know if i agree with that, but i do know there is a self we abandon in the end of anything, and there’s a wealth of complexity to dive into in that. it’s a total gold mine. <br><br>i don’t love the trope strictly in the romantic right person wrong time way, either. i love exes who know they were bad for each other, exes who had no chemistry, exes who aren’t technically exes but they slept together once, exes whose relationship was so irrelevant in the wider scheme of things that even they forget they dated. it can be itfs or yuuji &amp; ozawa in flls. it can be kmtr or fuji &amp; murai in the idol au, chris &amp; victor in ltmmly, bachira &amp; otoya in hairpin turns. i haven’t had the chance to write exes who hate each other’s guts and have nothing nice to say about the other, but i think that’s partly bc i’m blessed to still have strong friendships with the people that count as my exes and partly bc hatred hasn’t been justifiable in the dynamics i’ve written. but there is so much there. i will love it 90% of the time.</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh like official merch? i like to hunt down stuff from pop-up stores on like. the far corners of the internet. i have this miniature version of mori-senpai’s painting &amp; the entire collection of sketchbooks from (what used to be) the blue period museum shop, and the official nendoroids of nagi from blue lock and haruhi from ouran dressed in some custom clothes from good smile. i have the gundam pharact, several pop mart blind box figures, &amp; some stuff from back when i used to buy manga from cd japan and bought merch from comic alley in the philippines, like vongola rings from katekyo hitman reborn and a box of makkachin keychains from yuri on ice. <br><br>looking around my room right now and hm… the remaining stuff i see were made by friends, local artists, or myself. i have a mob psycho 100 print from art by pea, an itoshi sae keychain i made for my house keys and this framed polaroid of rin &amp; bachira from blue lock, a ceramic shelf of yuuta from jjk by karen thurler, an orv print and some bookmarks that a friend gifted me a couple years ago, a handful of hq fanbooks (the onigiri miya unofficial cookbook, the final stretch, to name a few) + one voltron comic by sibi. some of those came with their own freebies, like prints and standees, but i unfortunately don’t have much wall/shelf space to spare so i keep them packed away in their own box with some old kpop stuff.</div>

 <div class=reply>i do !! anything in the playlist after the last flls-related track (“one more time, one more chance” by masayoshi yamazaki, the song request from the last radio caller in flls) is actually for some kind of we 😊<br><br>now that i think about it i’m not sure if people usually see the custom order the playlist is in — it might depend on spotify’s default way of showing track lists — but it’s all ordered according to which part of the story they correspond to, and anything from “this love” by taylor swift onwards are songs i associate with the events of the coda, including its flashbacks. my personal inside joke is that lord huron’s “the night we met” makes me think of the break-up scene, and it feels cyclical that their cover of “harvest moon” was the song i had in mind during the slow dancing scene in skow. plus it just aligns with the moon motifs in the coda, which in turn aligns with the theme of itfs’ canon birth date moons, etc. <br><br>that said, my radar for skow-related songs is definitely not as attentive as the one for flls (or maybe i just don’t listen to songs about happy endings in relationships omg) so it’s a bit of a paltry collection haha</div>

 <div class=question>i wonder if it's very odd that i've yet to read your fics but find you to be absolutely fascinating. a friend sent me flls as a fic rec since i only recently started getting into itafushi. the opening question and megumi's entire answer alone has me thinking, 'this is probably (definitely) going to change my life and leave me rattled for a while, i don't know if i can afford that with an important exam coming in less than three weeks.' <br><br>still, it did leave me with a curiosity for the person who wrote that opening and i eventually found myself absolutely intrigued in the way you answer your ccs. didn't go too far back but i really, truly and wholeheartedly admire the way you navigate the online space, how you word your thoughts and carry yourself. i'm excited to come back to flls once i'm done tackling my exam paper, but in the mean time, i am very curious since someone asked you about horror recently. <br><br>with my newfound adoration for your brain and my own longstanding enthusiasm for horror, i wanted to ask: what is horror to you specifically? in your research for horror, was there any piece of media that stood out? is there any sub-genres in horror that you like? (example: slashers, found footage, liminal, lovecraftian, etc.) <br><br>no pressure in answering! i've always had a fondness for this genre and i'm always eager to hear another person's perspective on it. heh. i hope you're having a lovely november, sha!</div>

 <div class=reply>oh god idk if that opening newsletter is an honest assessment of my character, to be fair :( but i am holding close to heart these beyond kind sentiments nonetheless, thank you very much for taking the time to articulate them to me 🫂🤍<br><br>horror to me is… maybe wrongness? i struggle with slasher films as horror, though ofc many of them are good stories &amp; i do feel nostalgic for ones i watched as a kid. but my personal litmus test is whether the horror crawls into my chest. what one finds unnatural does tend to be subjective, granted; some people find death and gore unnatural, others ghosts and ghouls, and i also wonder if it’s bc i grew up with/around a lot of blood and physical injury/violence that these never reach the feeling of wrongness i crave. what i want is to try rationalizing a thing and for it not to matter. a recent one that comes to mind is skinamarink — does that count as analog horror? it combined old tech &amp; domestic spaces, which are two things i am usually more open to finding scary. more so than liminal places as a whole, i like the flavour of liminality embedded in old TVs, old wired telephones, a jukebox that starts and stops by itself bc it’s That old, grainy frank sinatra. there’s liminality that’s comforting, then there’s liminality that crosses over to that literal limbo between familiar and removed from you. i really enjoy that creeping sense of wrongness as your brain struggles to resolve all these pieces but is ofc unable to. i love being cornered into that position; it’s such a novel sensation. nothing else feels like that.<br><br>in the distinction that critics make bw horror &amp; terror, i’m probably more team terror. shirley jackson’s short stories are quite good at the horror i love + thematically, stories like “louisa, please come home” and “paranoia” are just so fun to chew on. i also love thomas ligotti, partly bc his style of prose is genre-rare and partly bc we share enough philosophy to overlap in where we find wrongness. i’m reading his nonfiction rn, where he writes that all supernatural horror derives from what we feel should be and should not be. i like when things target the smack middle of that. video games are quite good at it. but i think i just find it thrilling when my brain struggles. lovecraftian in a sense, though interestingly eldritch/cosmic horror is so inherently beyond human comprehension that i don’t find it terrifying. the idea of being adrift in space, yes, but creatures beyond our understanding out there — the awe at how little we know wins.<br><br>this got very unfocused, i’m sorry. i didn’t even get to talk about my love for haunted houses and bodies as prisons. but my big answer is that horror is wrongness, and wrongness is personal. <br><br>i loved answering this ahhh thank you for giving me a chance to talk about horror !! i hope your exam season is going well + that you have time to recuperate over the holidays. and if you do end up reading flls, i hope you find something in it just for you.</div>

 <div class=reply>i talk about some gripes so far here: https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1336607489 but i do want to add that anime mahoraga was... weirdly underwhelming? not bc they downplayed its scale and power so much as i didn’t appreciate how lean its impact was, if that makes sense. it felt like any other opponent, just extra big and singleminded. toji had more heaviness to his fighting. hell, megumi’s other shikigami had more girth. but i know that’s a personal preference and not really a storytelling critique. <br><br>as odd as this sounds, my fav shibuya arc parts in the manga were sukuna and toji’s respective fights. it was like. shibuya arc: all stars. shibuya arc: return of the masters. so i’m relieved that jjk s2 and i were on the same page about most of those. was toji’s fight with dagon total overkill? yeah. but there’s a bastardization to toji that i find so refreshing, and especially in this scene. it’s everything i love about a character — resourceful, brutal, but almost playful in how dangerous they are? seeing playful cloud desecrated in that way has always been one of my fav toji scenes, something about the thematic weight of handling this traditional almost sacred weapon like it’s an extension of his body (which you can unpack so many ways parallel to toji), only for him to handcraft it into the weapon He needs in that moment. mappa was clearly going for shounen coolness, whatever, but they were also hands-off enough with it that i just got to enjoy having competent people onscreen. and his fight with megumi, how they did toji asking him for his name but also how they handled the gravity of the danger megumi was in (loooove megumi finding himself thrown across an entire street and thinking huh? what just happened? bc Yeah ofc) while underscoring that toji truly is the goat of the series. and not just bc he’s a good fighter, but bc he’s all of jjk’s strongest themes mashed into a character who had the privilege of not overstaying his welcome under gege’s hands.<br><br>and sukuna’s shibuya fight(s) !! i hate to love it but it has no competition. his first domain expansion in the anime was the reason i read jjk, and i might always love how they describe its precision &amp; artistry. plus suwabe junichi embeds this kind of curiosity in sukuna, in how laidback but vicious &amp; smart a fighter he is. idk how the current fight is going in the manga, but i’ll always be a huge fan of shibuya sukuna being a problem not simply bc has perfected curse technique but bc he knows how to make use of any tool/space on top of being propelled by this almost. respect. for jujutsu. or at least there’s something artistic/academic about how he studies mahoraga and even learns jogo’s technique. i used to wonder if his transformation into sukuna the curse was research gone too far — but who knows with jjk. <br><br>overall, s2 has just made me appreciate geto’s fighting style, and appreciate toji, yuuji and sukuna’s even more than i already did. so. the shounen is shounen-ing.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha!<br>i don’t know if anyone has ever asked you this, but what are your thoughts on sibling bonds? and do you have any piece of media that you think portray siblings relationships well (i’m always thinking of succession…or little sister? grave of the fireflies maybe?)?</div>

 <div class=reply>each of the media pieces you mentioned were like stray bullets hitting me square in the chest one by one, which honestly reflects where i stand on sibling bonds in media 😭 i’ve only had the chance to write one properly in 1.5 fics, but they feature heavily in my personal/original writing. there’s no heartbreak like having a sibling, i think. succession Does do it very well, but my fav siblings are prob zuko &amp; azula from a:tla. something about being favoured by two different parents and that reflecting on the other’s judgment of everything that you are (dad saying that azula was born lucky while zuko was lucky to be born; mom loving zuko more than azula, who felt that her own mother thought she was a monster). how it is for the two of you, despite it all, with no love or trust lost, being the only ones to understand the haunted house you grew up in. there’s so much they do subtly but well in zuko &amp; azula’s rs (the ember island house, azula’s manipulations), but their final fight being of grief, with the most lament-heavy theme of the series playing over it instead of some boss battle ost, bc they were just kids and they could have had each other through all these years — but they didn’t. they remain children nonetheless. which is what sibling bonds do. there’s a point where you become older than your parents; some of us never even got to be younger. but with siblings, forever and always, you are a child. you are everything you can’t escape, and so are they.<br><br>i also like siblings in greek myth: oedipus’ children, poor things, and agamemnon &amp; clytemnestra’s cursed children. johan &amp; nina, from urasawa’s monster. nox by anne carson, which unpacks catullus 101, the ultimate brother elegy of all time . and most everything in this tag: https://nswers.tumblr.com/tagged/a%20shovel%20for%20a%20brother <br><br>some sibling dynamics that aren’t favs necessarily but that i find interesting... rhaenyra &amp; aegon from house of the dragon? stealing what you’ve always felt was only your sister’s birthright even as you receive what you never got from your family through exactly that usurping. or maybe my sister’s keeper the movie? what it means to be conceived as a savior sibling, to know you were born into the world for utility, for someone else’s life, but that life is your sister’s. i do also love lighthearted sibling relationships like in little sister, and grave of the fireflies is one of my fav ghibli movies, but i admit i have the softest spot for the abels &amp; cains. the love only possible when someone has sucked you dry, and you know you’ve twisted a knife in them too — that’s what having a sibling feels like to me. it’s rare that it feels like how love should be. but it can be. it’s nice when media manages to capture that, like in succession. a person who has drunk from the same poisoned cup doesn’t have the antidote any more than you do, but there is comfort in not waiting for death or life alone. so yes. i embrace sibling dynamics in stories, definitely.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, that is very sweet to say, thank you. i’m afraid it’s a lot more low effort than the time and thought most people dedicate to their intricate carrds, is the thing... my only real process is to start off with a blank page and a container, to make it neater, and from there, design around one central visual and colour palette. in the case of the earnest carrd, it was the ceramic gifs by jeje constantino, which dictated the center alignment of my text and the blue alternate colour i used for links and icons. i also benefit a lot from using the carrd pages system, so that everything feels organized and simple to navigate. this is really just the “control” function, with the hashtag beside it when you’re dropping elements into a page. anything under a control header is essentially a new page, and you can link to it accordingly, such as in earnest.carrd.co/#links. (“#links” is the name of the control section.) <br><br>i’m not explaining this very well, i realize, but it’s really hard to describe what i mean when it’s more a matter of testing different elements on a blank page 😓 i tend to focus on symmetry and minimalism in designs purely bc i don’t have the skill set to pull off anything more intricate, and i mean, i don’t think there’s any shame in that. if i have one tip, it’s to check the mobile view of your site to make sure it looks functional on phones as well. but as long as everything is a coherent colour palette, which i’m sure generators exist for somewhere online, it should look neat and cogent. don’t be afraid to mess around with link colours and hover animations. i believe there are tutorials on youtube/tiktok for more specific templates and/or aesthetics, so don’t hesitate to look things up bc even tutorials that don’t interest you might have tricks to be learned. carrd also has a fairly substantial faq/guide section, and there is no query to small.</div>

 <div class=reply>there are so many ways to answer this but the simplest is that adam parrish is the kind of fav character that nearly dims all others. it’s funny bc it’s not as if i have any overwhelming affection for the raven cycle as a whole beyond forever loving something you loved with teenage abandon, but even if an unthinkable hell comes for me and my heart is emptied of love for all stories, there will probably still be adam. dogged survivor, complicated lover, cold-blooded murderer, etc. a rare case of a character never having been loved yet not needing to soften and unravel to receive it from people willing to give it. unflinchingly competent and uncompromisingly clear-eyed in a series that badly needs you to empathize with everyone. tender, sharp, vulnerable, difficult about love in both giving and receiving, but malleable. no oversentimentality to his emotion, no overrationality in his intuition. heart on his sleeve, but no one except his chosen people will be able to reach touching distance. poster child of all my loves and hatreds and failures and successes. <br><br>murai yakumo &amp; kim gongja come very close, though, both of them unhinged in their own ways, and both survivors of their own tragedies without letting that get in the way of holding themselves accountable to their own lives and futures. margaery tyrell, both of the books &amp; the show. clever and dangerous, aware of every gear in the machine and unafraid to weaponize what she must even at too vulnerable a position. azula, whom i think the a:tla spinoffs actually ended up compromising, as well as all the women of the house of atreus in greek tragedy.<br><br>as for themes, i love my regressors (the webtoon kind, the ones trapped in a life/event looped again and again, even if only metaphorically), crown princes (heir to Something, whether an idea or literal authority), &amp; mechanical beings (androids, almost alive/almost human characters, humans raised to be flawless, non-humans yearning to be flawed, perfection like a kidney stone weighing them down and leaving them unshakeable for better or for worse). many of my fav characters are just combination/variations of these, tbh. i enjoy ruthlessness, above all with a sense of decorum, but i like a good enfant terrible as well. i guess i just prefer competence, which honestly just reflects my overall personality. maybe why i tend to gravitate towards antagonist-type characters. obsession, fumbling, and/or being a lovable loser can be sweet, but i’m never fully interested. i’m not a big backstory enthusiast, either, at least not of the flashback variety; i often think it’s not necessary to know what came before the story we’ve been dropped into. it helps, and it should exist, but the present is the story and so the story is the present. <br><br>ahhh my mind is whirring so many characters in mind so little space... i am also wishing you tranquility for the remainder of your year, and thank you for this fascinating q 😵‍💫</div>

 <div class=reply>i love ethel cain so much that i put all her music in one playlist and when i feel emotions about to get the best of me i lay myself down on the floor and put it on shuffle to simulate all the steps of one life and the feelings it comes with<br><br>also. i tend to form strong feelings about the concept of inherent “rawness” in art, or at least about associating purity with personal/confessional art, with songwriters “revealing” their lives through music that we receive the poignancy of bc we know the reality they correspond to. here’s an incoherent tangent from years ago, for example: https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1487632795409297409?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw. so it’s just freeing in the simplest sense to be on the same page as an artist about their art being only performance. ethel cain is not a person, though she’s made real through ethel cain the persona and ethel cain the character. she had a whole life and death that has nothing to do with whatever hayden anhedönia does behind the scenes, about which i could not care less, and it’s this fictional entity and the vessels that hayden the artist has chosen to tell ethel’s story with that move me. it’s a clear contract between creator and consumer, if that makes sense. so i get to receive an album like preacher’s daughter without concern for my usual gripes about the creator’s ego/desire to be autobiographical getting in the way of something that could have been more. it’s not a could have been with ethel cain. preacher’s daughter — and all her previous EPs and singles before it — is clear on exactly what kind of narrative it is, and it doesn’t hinge its brilliance on the effectiveness of pathos. which i value, and i would argue is tricky to do in music, where reactions must be subjective to be earned. her sense for melody is also stunning, and her lyrics both beautiful and economic, together heartbreaking without needing to break itself for you to want to look. preacher’s daughter alone wields so many genres to serve its narrative arc, but the grip on the overall medium is unshakeable. drives me insane. it’s rare that i can’t pick just one fav song exactly bc one album is the fav but. of her whole discography, crush, sun bleached flies and western nights probably make my current podium. i’ve also talked quite a bit about a house in nebraska on main, like in this: https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1623783336102567937?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw<br><br>anyway. this rant is not reflective of a smart brain, reading it back, but it means the world to me to receive your graciousness in turn, you know. thank you for lending me your ear and your heart so sincerely. like — i ramble, but i also know what a privilege it is to have people not only be willing to prompt my thoughts at all, but to be receptive to them as well. the quantity might overwhelm me sometimes and i may struggle to answer too many quickly, but i really am aware of how spoiled i am, and i am grateful for it.</div>

 <div class=reply>i keep going over possible answers i may have to this but it truly is just... i usually allot around one to two hours before i sleep to rearrange shoes, towels, the stuff on my desk and my bedside table, again and again. then i do a lap around the house, front to back, to make sure all the plugs are securely in, all the dials in the stove are at zero, all the doors are closed, all the right locks and mechanisms are in place behind doors and windows — which in themselves are not what takes up time more so the feeling of it? it’s a tactile sensation i have to target. i have to feel all of them, and it has to feel right. if not, or if i zone out at any point, i have to restart the routine. if i go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, i have to do it all again from zero. i also often have to wash my hands and feet before i can slip back into bed. i will not be able to sleep otherwise. this persists at hotels, as well as if i’m staying over at a friend’s place. may it be ocd or whatever else, i’ve been doing it since i was a kid, so it has become more ritualistic than anything else. the things we have to do to feel safe, etc.<br><br>not sure if that aligns with what you meant, but a less time-consuming but also less frequent part of my sleep routine would be taking a perfume sample i know i’ll never use (but that i like all the same) and using it almost as a makeshift air freshener? also, does it count that i munch on lollipops while writing? i was into katekyo hitman reborn and a series of unfortunate events at the same time as a kid, and that kinda just. combined into my violet baudelaire ribbon of choice being a lollipop thanks to this reborn character named spanner. i just like having something to gnaw on while i type. i guess that’s not really a ritual. i do try to read before bed, but i’m often too tired, and i just try to make up for it on weekends by reading upon waking up. <br><br>this is making me realize i don’t really do anything interesting that would count as a ritual, i’m sorry 😓 i’m such a slow creature of routine that they never quite become rituals. i’m neurotically neat, even, from my handwriting to the way i set the table. but i will think more about it! this really is a cute question, and i appreciate you asking so kindly.</div>

 <div class=reply>wait wait wait is you are in love not in the flls playlist that’s really odd omg did i never plop it in ?? maybe i just didn’t want to use a song that wasn’t taylor’s version, but — whoa. such oversight on my part. it’s in there now. how bizarre. <br><br>thank you so so much for sending such a sweet message (and an inadvertent reminder to add to the playlist) 🥹<br><br>slight aside, but you are in love was one of the first songs i associated with flls way way way back when i was writing what would become the second chapter. partly bc it was maybe the only one i knew from 1989 at the time, and partly bc i wanted flls to stay an established relationship college age story then. i remember being a little wistful that i couldn’t maintain the innocence and delicacy of those early moments and intentions — but kinda worth it for how satisfyingly full circle it feels to hear there’s still some associations to be made there despite it all. puts a smile on my face in turn, so thank you for taking the time to tell me something so lovely.</div>

 <div class=question>hey!<br>i’m a frequent visitor of this inbox and therefore know that you’ve answered questions on taylor swift’s music before. and i have been curious to know whether you have a favorite “from the vault” track! i’m not sure if you’ve listened to any of her rerecorded albums, but i also don’t know if you’ve heard any of the “vault” tracks somewhere on the internet, even if it was just a snippet.<br>so if you do have a favorite, i’d like to know your opinion on it!<br>thank you and have a lovely, lovely day 🩶</div>

 <div class=reply>yes, actually !! this isn’t meant to be, like, a humble brag or to fish for compliments, i think it’s incredibly over-generous, but when speak now taylor’s version first dropped, a couple friends sent me when emma falls in love to say it reminded them of me — which. i know how that sounds coming from my own mouth. i really do, i promise. again. it’s very kind and generous of them, and i admit people tend to have a more romantic view of me than i know i deserve. but i bring it up to say i have a close personal relationship with that song. associating it with a memory involving two friends lends it sentimental value, though i do enjoy it as a song altogether. its chorus melody is so memorable and effective, even if it’s not the most lyrically intricate; the vocal rise at cleo-[pa]-tra is beautiful, and reminds me of the melody choices i love in the bridge of the story of us. you know the “i liked it better when you were [on] my side” + “if you said you’d rather [love] than fight”? that little vocal pitch? it moves me so much, so of course i’m weak to when emma falls in love’s version of the same technique. <br><br>my just-me personal favourite of the from the vault tracks i’ve heard so far is castles crumbling, though! i went right to it after i was sent when emma falls in love bc i saw the hayley williams feature but it just captured me in an instant. i love a vivid and potent viva la vida-esque imagery of a fallen monarch, and the bridge is beyond stunning. it could very well be a middle of act ii song in a musical that i’d eat up. i don’t know if the 10min version of all too well counts as from the vault, but i am not immune to its second half. some of the most lyrically strong i’ve heard of taylor, i think, and not just in isolation; the melody and the words work in total harmony, without relying on contextual support. so fun to shout along to and more intently listen to each time. <br><br>i also enjoy the pieces i’ve heard of i can see you whenever i hear it online... oh, and nothing new! i had that one on repeat when i was writing something for blue period, so it also has the same soft spot that songs i associate with friends do. i love the wispy, wistful quality of it. reminds me of the after-heartbreak atmosphere in exile, where taylor and bon iver are exchanging “you never gave a warning sign / i gave so many signs” — if that makes sense. it’s not the same musically at all, granted, but the feeling of that first breath after something has ended for good. the first awareness of the gap that will become distance. i feel like that’s something nothing new captured for me. <br><br>otherwise, i haven’t listened to the from the vault tracks from the other taylor’s version albums, unfortunately. but please know i am always open to being sent taylor song recs!</div>

 <div class=reply>i promise i am hardly a librarian… but thank you, that is so cute :( i think i’ve gotten this question a couple times before and have tended towards recommending authors with an “older” style of writing? donna tartt, patricia highsmith, james salter, don delillo, toni morrison, jeanette winterson, zora neal hurston, colson whitehead, raymond carver. nabokov, kundera, steinbeck, joyce, angelou. but this is more of a matter of intricacy of style, especially compared to the contemporary tendency to opt for shorter, cooler, more detached sentences. if you’re looking for more baldwin in the context of romance/romantic themes, the poetry of franz wright and diane seuss are oddly the closest link my mind is supplying, as is the famous play angels in america by tony kushner. kafka’s more romance-leaning works as well, like letters to milena. nonfiction wise, bell hooks is always a great place to start after baldwin (if you haven’t read through her oeuvre yet). i also recommend the nikki giovanni episode of talk easy with sam fragoso. they talk about a really interesting conversation she and james baldwin had, and i think she offers the sort of gentle counter-stance i like to seek out after spending a lot of time with one author.<br><br>none of this are likely to be perfect fits, but i hope at least one set you down the right path to fill the baldwin-shaped space !!</div>

 <div class=reply>i’ve kept watching, yes! i’m quite cleanly divided about the shibuya arc right now… i hated how they did gojo’s sealing, including the fight right before. i think a lot of my issues have just been with pacing? feels like there’s a lack of cohesion in how to approach those first few moments of the shibuya set-up: do we keep it quiet and suspenseful? light and rhythmic? what dialogue pieces do we prioritize, and how do we arrange the entry and exit of so many characters to serve those? the result felt like it diminished the gravity of gojo being sealed, plot and energy wise, and there was just an overwhelming sense that they were trying to be too artful with something that was meant to be quick and dirty. the beginning of shibuya just did not feel like shibuya, and those pacing issues persisted all the way until toji returns. i know people love the nanami scene with haruta, but my gripe is that you can’t try to make a scene what it’s not and not expect the energy to feel a bit off relative to the story you have to keep telling. there were just these odd pockets that felt less cinematic and more trying to nudge the audience towards a particular reaction when the scene content speaks for itself. you see that same issue with the csm anime and a little of jigokuraku. very unfortunate. <br><br>something that has really surprised me though was the choso vs. yuuji fight? the blatant over-expansion and kind of — contrived? almost? artfulness? worked to the benefit of this scene likely bc of the nature of choso’s ability. and yuuji is just a beauty to block for any director, i imagine, bc his fighting style is so dynamic for storyboarding and it shows. stars aligned here, and they cultivated a steady rhythm that i really enjoyed. it was stunning in a way that felt earned and even necessary. that, and amazing use of space! i’ve always had a bone to pick with akutami about maximizing space in fights but mappa has always been good at working around it. the nobara &amp; yuuji vs. eso &amp; kechizu fight in s1 was beautifully mapped, but s2 has struggled with it (geto’s fight with a curse user at riko’s school, the way they used the forest in the first few frames of the toji vs. gojo fight) so it’s nice to see space be almost integral to the animation choices in the choso vs. yuuji fight. mappa has also been quite consistent in using the 8mm/16mm film style for certain flashbacks, so i don’t mind that they employed this in choso’s fake memories with yuuji. <br><br>mappa loves toji too much, i would say. but i’m not really complaining about that. i love when secondary characters show up and can’t help generating momentum. i’ve breathed easier about the shibuya arc since he came back — hard not to be dragged into the flow when characters like him are in the story, and it’s funny that not even animation is immune. it almost makes up for how bland they did itfs’ fight with the old man, but we take what we can get (and what the budget/time allotments spare these poor animators).</div>

 <div class=reply>as a person? vile man, i’m sure. male artists tend to be when given access to power and authority in their lifetime, and i’m sure he’s no different when he served in the military and came out of it disgruntled, disillusioned and disoriented about american life. that serves the ennui of his work, but it must have made him practically unbearable. <br><br>as for his work, i like to tout that i’m a salinger-reared writer mostly bc i’m sure his character writing/dialogue/introspection had the strongest hand of any author in whatever personal style i have developed since. i used to think i’ll write the young people of the world forever like he did, but coming into my own has mostly just been shaking off everything salinger taught me to make space for myself. in the end, i do just enjoy much of his work, and i feel a lot for the glass family stories even beyond f&amp;z — which, side note, i giggled So much at you going Yes Sha We Know How You Feel About Franny and Zooey i’m sorry for never shutting up about it 😭<br><br>my fav salinger story is maybe uncle wiggily in connecticut? i think stories like a perfect day for bananafish and for esmé with love and squalor (which was my first salinger — i read it thanks to a childhood lemony snicket phase) are popular for a reason, but something about uncle wiggily is just… tender like a years-old scar, and more evocative than any other salinger for me. there’s so much loneliness in it, so much isolation and absence of warmth embedding a deep desire for it even deeper. it’s like stepping into a photo of an empty living room. or a canvas painted in the same colour as its blank state. the abandonment of a space made for living is such a potent sensation, and this story captures that without it even being the focus. this one features a cameo of one of franny and zooey’s older brothers, but more generally, i would say it just contains much of what makes the zooey novella so good. the management of energy, the fluidness of dialogue, the alive-ness of the characters. we Know these people. but whereas zooey felt like the first humid day of spring, uncle wiggily is the bite of a winter wind through a window no one realized was left open in a massive, mostly unoccupied house. my heart caves in to make a little empty concave in my chest every time i think about it. <br><br>a few of his uncollected works are also quite good, though the main thing is — i just don’t think there’s a salinger work i wouldn’t recommend, even ones i do not love as much. that includes catcher in the rye, which is definitely one of his weakest, but i think that’s both the length and the narrator choice getting in the way of his strengths. salinger is always doing something interesting with character, i find, even if his themes and undertones remain always familiar. maybe that’s why i’m so partial to him. it’s a rare privilege to have an author compatible with your own writing preferences.</div>

 <div class=reply>no no it’s okay !! here are some previous replies:<br><br>— https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1335125988 <br>— https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1308398481 <br><br>here is a tweet that was Kind Of about akutami if not solely: https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1514062884241911809?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw <br><br>this tweet is not about akutami but is applicable to him: https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1675409509118799873?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw<br><br>some current popular shounen animanga wobble in quality bc the mangakas don’t seem to realize that their instincts are bad; they believe that what they’re doing is the story they need to be telling, and that can lead to choices that are not always successful and/or fulfilling for readers. not everyone can be haikyuu’s author playing it safe and having that result in a near perfect work, nor do many weekly mangakas have the same timeframe as monthly ones to let the story breathe and go slowly if it needs to. so what we end up with is a tight timeline, a barely edited chapter belonging to a wider unedited story, and a compulsive pressure to keep readers talking and interested this week and the next, and the next, and the next. jjk (and akutami) is very much a victim of that.<br><br>that said, it’s painful to watch a mangaka confidently steer the story to the opposite of the heights it could have reached. there’s a lack of interrogation by multiple parties involved, and what we get is a work like jjk, which is the story equivalent of an idol group that skyrocketed to fame with a concept that worked for them, only for their recent comebacks to completely lose the original thread that made them unique bc the management focused on the wrong element to champion in an increasingly saturated industry. i think akutami knows full well what will make a good story. jjk does have good bones, even if not special ones. it’s in conversation with a predecessor that’s genuinely subpar (bleach) and you can tell gege takes what he liked and didn’t like and applies them accordingly. he just does not know how to juggle tone, plot, art, character, comedy, &amp; heart, and in the process of trying to act like he can, he has dropped all the balls. jjk is currently running purely on its own initial momentum, and even that, akutami is about to drain. he focuses on plot, we get characters we don’t care about. he focuses on light comedy, jjk loses its footing on heart. i said this about another work, but jjk is a story trying to do so much bc once upon a time it almost pulled it off. makes you want to just. tell them to focus on getting one ball from one palm to another. bc at least maybe then we’ll all be sure they can catch it.<br><br>sometimes i do wonder what could have been if jjk hadn’t become so popular so suddenly, and it’s not that i don’t empathize with the headspace akutami seems to be in amidst an unforgiving schedule. but. as cold as it sounds, his ego has no place in his story. for its sake, his, and ours.</div>

 <div class=reply>i do! i absooluuuutely do. it’s great that you ask about balance, bc i do think that’s what it comes down to. escapism isn’t a bad thing in itself, even in extremes; sometimes it’s all we have for a coping mechanism. why want to escape if there’s nothing to escape, right? <br><br>i don’t know what kind of escapism you mean — if it’s maladaptive daydreaming or just preferring fictional media over reality or if it’s something else — and i can’t say i have an easy fix as someone who also tends to contemplate more than i execute. but i imagine it’s like quitting any drug. it will take years before it is completely out of your system, and even then there are worse vices than escapism. balance is about indulging in smaller and smaller doses of the thing causing harm, until the neutral is an amount that doesn’t deal so much damage as to inhibit you. i have a personal rule of no escapism/daydreaming/tuning out when i’m around other people. it’s fine if i lose hours talking to myself or daydreaming and doing nothing — though that is its own problem — but if i’m letting that bleed into something that affects other people, even just a stranger at the bus stop, that’s where i draw the line. so no mind-wandering while i’m around another person, and that includes messages, one-on-one conversation, being a passive member of a group or an audience, and sometimes even any time i’m on public. i catch myself daydreaming on the bus? i’ll open a book, and if i find my mind wandering, i will reread every single sentence i was not fully present for. it’s not really about severing the instinct to daydream — again, that in itself is not the culprit of dysfunction. it’s about training other habits in yourself, so that daydreaming is not the only thing it has to default to. you know how sometimes when you’re not understanding a line you’re reading, you read it out loud to yourself until it sounds like a more comprehensible sentence? or at least i do, and always, there’s a sensation of like. returning to my body as understanding dawns. that’s what would be useful to give yourself, i think. just the ability to hone and rely on that switch when and if you need it, bc there will be moments that you will. you don’t have to live your life to the absolute fullest; you just have to be present for what’s there, for better or for worse. <br><br>often, too, the more you daydream, the more you escape into something more ideal, the more separate that possibility becomes. suddenly, it’s not just future you you’re fantasizing about, but the you that you could have been. like they are a whole other entity. which doesn’t feel great. it’s nice to leave a path between what’s real and what can still be. <br><br>today’s landscape makes escapism So easy, even necessary. it truly is hard to win. i know this a massively broad statement to dump on someone’s no context message, but i hope there is at least one useful piece there somewhere :(</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha&lt;3 this is the anon that sent the cc about being insubstantial and (for lack of better word) freaking out abt not being able to capture any of myself— or anything— in writing. i came back once to update you abt a poem i was able to write… i am coming back again because now i am writing short fiction scenes that i am so happy with… not because it’s brilliant or unique in any way, but because it is undeniably mine, and honest. it feels like a breath of fresh air, to be able to write not in expectation of Something with a capital S but just. something for its own sake whether of lovable or not. it feels like i’m getting myself back— or maybe i’m coming back even better. <br>anyhow, i’ve reread your reply to that cc countless of times ever since you posted it and… i hope it’s alright for me to say this, odd as it is coming from a faceless stranger, but you have helped me so much with writing and existing… i think i have finally come to terms with my hands, in all the possible meanings that may take on. this new founded love i have for writing— i cannot capture the magnitude of the tenderness i feel towards it. it seems so silly but i just feel… so incredibly lucky, to love writing so much. to be thankful for the late nights i cheated in middle school and high school, writing absolutely nothing but calling it poetry anyways, to take those years of stuttering and fashion it into something closer to complete. you mentioned something, sometime ago, about writing earning your love because it’s one of life’s only corners where moderation is not required. i think i finally get that; i think i’ve finally learned how to indulge.<br>anyhow, i’m not writing poetry anymore but these short scenes feel much closer to me than any of those “poems” did… and i am hoping to write a short fic one of these days🫶🏼<br>i wanted to tell you all this because i really don’t think i would’ve been able to grow as neither person nor writer if i hadn’t stumbled upon flls, and finding your cc through it.<br>thank you! i owe you incredibly much. this was an awful tangent but i hope dearly my sentiments translated through.<br>i hope your hands have been warm, and the days, colder— as you like them.<br><br>(p.s., i just checked the date— i saved your response in my notes app— of your reply, and it’s been exactly one year, on this day, that you had answered. what are the chances..?!?! it is a sign. i am taking it as a sign…)<br><br>much love ♡</div>

 <div class=reply>!!!! that’s an amazing development !!!!!! are you kidding !!!! the way my hands are trembling a bit omg dksdjs warn me next time before you snipe my heart out of my chest. good god. it’s been a bit of a difficult weekend and i am extra prone to getting choked up, to be fair, but “i cannot capture the magnitude of the tenderness i feel towards it” just really got me, i think. then ended your message with “and the days, colder—as you like them.” i mean. damn. <br><br>listen, anything can be a poem, right? even a forgotten dream can be a poem. a relationship can be a poem. a bird can be a poem. i fully believe that as someone who only ever receives poetry as a reader. at the end of the day, i’m just glad you’re writing, and that there’s a — path? a conduit? towards returning to where writing feels like homecoming. thank you for taking the time to drop by again and update me, and i hope you know that the way you describe feeling about writing, that tenderness, is often how i feel when i get personal messages like these. makes me want to try harder to find the right words, and i really am sorry if ever i might have been too sharp and direct in any of them. i’m trying, too, myself, to be gentler with my honesty. even if it means not being able to answer as many of these ccs in one go. i really do value the time you and others have taken in writing to me, and i hope… i don’t know. i hope people realize that in writing to me at all, you’ve already used words in the way they are meant to be used in my eyes, and conveyed a fraction of yourself that i am receiving with a fraction of mine. that’s worth a lot to me. more than i know how to say. <br><br>this is all just a very long thank you + acknowledgement + expression of relief. much love to you as well. i hope that your own words continue to warm your heart as much as they have warmed mine.</div>

 <div class=question>sha . it’s me again . i caved in . i’m doing a practice essay on franny and zooey in preparation for my return as an english major. <br>and i need to scream. i know you already know this book so intimately but oh my god? the haiku “the little girl on the plane/ who turned her doll’s head/ to look at me,” being seymour’s suicide note. im going mad. why is it so amazingly Dense. to be so burdened with your existence that being recognized by a child and her ego absent ways that was once yours is enough to drive you over the edge. to lose so much love that that of all things is your goodbye letter. so cold..<br>the interchanging of love and religion and how love itself is a religion……. <br>the intimacy allowed at only a distance even if when wanting to present it in the flesh.<br>the needed haste to record one’s thoughts immediately when actually Feeling something because lingering on it any longer leads to over analysis that was engrained by academia, the less of a human, comforting presence you are because of this………… i need 2 sit down<br>this should not be as Big as it is but .. i am not that experienced of a reader and i think this novel is what really made me see the importance of characterization in writing. of course that’s to be expected but —??? everything zooey does is so fluid to his character, from his studies, his occupation as an actor, his learned callousness. and the mere act of recognition being a form of love when the glass family has a penchant for avoiding things. IDK this novel really just hammered the intricacy of story writing to me which sounds so silly bc ofc its intricate but the fluidity in this novel is so silky…………….. and i guess it’s just amplified when dealing with a topic so universal and personal at once.<br>anyhow yes this novel unlocked smth in me idek what but i’m waiting to figure that out and i hope this feeling only stays. i haven’t felt this way since reading giovanni’s room… do you have any other books that made you feel like this? i’ve been reading books with softer impressions and i wanna change it up….<br>i’m sorry for screaming abt this book… i have no one else to indulge with. hope you’ve been alright these days 🫶🏼</div>

 <div class=reply>have you… read… a perfect day for bananafish…? seymour’s story? it might read a little odd but with context about how seymour passed... it is. a new shade of heartbreak. i don’t blame the older glass siblings for running in different directions in the aftermath, but franny and zooey having to be left at the starting line, where not even buddy will come home — how do you find god &amp; meaning when you’ve been abandoned beyond control? if “love itself is a religion,” are franny and zooey’s search for god not simply their plea to be loved? but not loved imperfectly — loved like they never weren’t, bc you spend so long loving from the head that you don’t even know how to bargain with your heart to accept imperfect love. and franny is so against letting her own standards get the best of her, zooey so protective of his, but they’re both mainly trying to protect what they have left. salinger cinematic universe, when i catch you.<br><br>when i talk about loving your characters, i wonder if i just mean not to love them to the point that you make martyrs and saints out of them. they don’t all need happy endings, nor sane justifications for the choices they make and the words they say. sometimes giving your characters more layers that render them believably human to a reader is itself a kind of cruelty. it’s a shame how little writing there is on the absolute perfection that salinger has done with zooey in particular, how well you can see him from the moment we meet him in that tub to the way he sweats through his shirt to the very end, when he admits quietly that he’ll always be in love with acting. we don’t have to know if he even believes that. we just have to be there with him. and we were. and i feel like that’s something we’re starting to lose in this era of isolating references from stories or interpreting what this or that could mean. sometimes to interpret / analyze is to diminish a character or an entire story to a theme, a parallel, a reference. that has its merits, but… it’s just nice to have a story like franny and zooey. what the hell does any of it mean? who knows. who Cares. these are People. why would they stand for anything but themselves? <br><br>anyway. i just. feel you so much. i know i said that in various ways in the other reply, but truly, truly, there is so much in franny and zooey and i understand what you mean about it rerouting your relationship with how to view storytelling. i am so glad you took the leap and i am cheering you on loudly and proudly. if you haven’t read nine stories by salinger after franny and zooey, i highly recommend it! otherwise, baldwin’s beale street is another nice little study on how to sketch out characters for the sake of nothing else but character, as is beautiful world where are you by sally rooney and real life by brandon taylor. very few books let their characters stay strictly characters now, for many reasons related to the publishing industry, and it’s the biggest heartbreak of my life.</div>

 <div class=reply>i am also a kita enthusiast… an atsumu enthusiast as well… oh, but choosing just one is very hard. the first time i got into hq was like. 2014. and my favourite character then was oikawa. he still remains an all-timer, but by the time i got back into hq around 2020, there were just too many favourites across the board. <br><br>i think with hq there’s such a set formula in how furudate fleshes out characters, and they never deviate from it; not once does hq waver in sticking to fundamentals, and for the best of the whole cast. it doesn’t subvert or challenge anything, and what you love about one character could very well be what you love about another, just with a few elements swapped out for each other. the magic trick of hq is that everyone feels individual and separate on the surface, such that you will never mistake one character for another, even if the same narrative machinations fuel them underneath. <br>so i guess it’s more that i love dynamics and moments: the karasuno first years, the tokyo camp gym b group, the captains together, kenma and hinata, hirugami’s backstory, tsukishima’s block against shiratorizawa, a few kageyama dynamics outside of karasuno, kita’s philosophy — you know what i mean? it’s hard to pick one character bc everyone was created to represent the wider hq theses, and it’s those that we find ourselves moved by.<br><br>i always joke that hq would be the ideal work to teach in a First Year Intro To Storytelling course bc you can draw the exact lines and mark down the exact reasons for each narrative choice furudate made. it’s quintessential shounen, and that’s why we all love it. hq characters are far too kind and loved, i think; none of them are ruthless, truly, nor are any of them actually, properly flawed, which is typically what would single out one character for me to love. the story loves them all too much, and so i do as well. if that makes sense.</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m sure i have some past replies that delve more into general jjk fatigue, but here are some recent priv tweets: <br><br>1. akutami works the most magic when he’s taking notes from kubo it’s the funniest most ironic thing<br>2. akutami gege has the timing of a reality show veteran he saw the cameras rolling and gave it his best drama spin and i almost respect the complete inability to be serious<br>3. ​​i would say i’m amazed at how much i don’t care about the jjk thing but in total honesty i highly doubt 2020 me would have cared either... it’s also such a no shit choice that i probably Would care if he chickens out next chapter <br>4. akutami’s weakness isn’t that he wants to be contrarian it’s that he fancies himself a contrarian when he’s actually dependent on outside momentum and unable to keep a tight rein on it when he gets it. like a guy with a learner’s permit wanting to speed in a muscle car.<br>5. at this point i'm just curious how akutami would even think to get rid of [yuuta] which kubo trick will he rip off next to make it remotely believable i wonder<br><br>heavy on number 4, to answer your question on what i think about akutami’s writing in general. i have felt that way for as long as i’ve read jjk, and every single new chapter these days just further amplifies that. number 3 is about you-know-who’s death, but maybe it’s unfair to say i didn’t care; it was a long time coming, and i thought i would feel more strongly about it after anime hidden inventory, but the thing about akutami is that he ekes out every ounce of emotion you can possibly feel about something in the execution and leaves you to project it yourself in the wake of that. <br><br>it’s not his storytelling choices that’s the problem; it’s that he refuses to let the story breathe, and with it he strangles every available space for the right beats to do what it should. he’s good enough at creating characters and themes, and has the right ideas for who and where to look, but then it’s like shame catches up, or some kind of internal self-consciousness, and suddenly he can’t be bothered to allow his characters too much. which is So bizarre at best, and just off-putting at worst. it’s like he’s in constant disbelief that this is his work and he can do whatever he wants with it, and so he does exactly that and marvels at the mess that ensues. sometimes he even retreats, lets himself have hakari and higuruma after nanami and todo are off the inventory, but that’s another tangent. <br><br>that said, a lot of things about akutami make sense knowing he’s a huge bleach/tite kubo fan. but at least kubo excels at character design, if literally nothing else. akutami lets his personal feelings get in the way too much in his desperation to make it seem like he doesn’t have personal feelings to get in the way of anything — you know what i mean? <br><br>overall, the developments in the story aren’t what i take issue with. idc who dies if it’s done well. with all due respect, these were not done well.</div>

 <div class=reply>of course! as much as most people watch wes anderson, i guess. very much a casual thing. one of the first ever reviews i did in my since abandoned career as a film critic was grand budapest hotel, so in a way i do have to credit him for pushing me to that genre of writing, but maybe it’s not a good thing to convert someone from casual appreciator of film storytelling to a teenager angry enough about the lack of substance to a filmgoing experience as to write extensively about it for the first time. idk.<br><br>but no, at the end of the day, i don’t really have strong feelings about his work anymore. i’d eventually realize that the feelings i used to associate with him is more of a wider modern cinema problem than anything his fault. i do think he would benefit from having someone else do the screenplay while he directs, though. and that he excels far more in stop motion than otherwise. fantastic mr. fox is probably his strongest film in my eyes, and the royal tenenbaums his most overrated. i did actually kind of like the french dispatch, now that i’m thinking about it. i haven’t seen asteroid city, but would absolutely be down to watch it if i get the chance.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha i read franny and zooey (ljterally just finished todag) bc of u and.. i kinda hate how much i like and am comforted by it LMAO(?????? i am half laughing, half crying.) idk. u do not have to respond to this but idk.<br>recently i switched from my eng major to interdisciplinary studies before considering physics/comp sci bc i panicked and had No Idea what to do after a severe breakdown and. well. it feels like Zooey is talking directly to me (i am furious at how he even nailed it down to the religious aspects… it’s unnerving. during the time of this Panic i had been considering becoming a nun. no joke. and even then i knew it wasn’t for jesus, and at that time it felt like desperation— though even still i knew this desperation would only last for a few weeks at most. meaning it wasn’t really desperation. wasn’t really anything but fear, and insecurity, uncertainty. and just like franny, i made my own version of jesus and said that’s who i’m “devoting” myself to.. geez. to be read and strung apart like that— i feel more sane recognizing its universal reach. i feel more like a child, too.) and with zooey, his being vulnerable in the wrong ways, his aversion to sentiments… between franny and zooey, i feel like i’m being torn between the two, by the two. i wouldn’t take it back, though. it feels like a refreshing punch to the gut, embarrassing as that is to say. christ<br>anyways sorry for this spastic and awful and unoriginal tangent. i literally just don’t know what to do. in a good, embarrassing way. i half want to reread it and half don’t. i want to write an essay on it. i hate that i want to write an essay on it. i find comfort in it (🚩🚩‼️) and i’m livid. mortified. can you believe. <br>franny and zooey dug a nail into me. i hate it. i love it. you know how a geode hides its crystal inside a rough, dour exterior? that is my relationship with this book. it makes me incredibly mad. and everything is inarticulate and ineffable but i just Had to scream somewhere. please feel free to throw this out. i know how insufferable this sounds— i know how much it reeks of literally Everything. pretentiousness. immaturity. a blink awake too late. and privilege. i should’ve read this book much younger. <br>anyways. i’m clutching onto the impression franny and zooey pressed into me. i (begrudgingly) thank you for it, bc i never would have read it if not for you (all with a light heart, of course, and i hope you’ve been well and taking care and reading many kind and inspiring things, sha. thanks for all the wonderful books you put on my radar) 🌷🩷</div>

 <div class=reply>you have no idea how painful it was to receive this and not be able to answer it immediately bc it would be unfair to not go in order omg i am shaking you back !! i know !! i Know. <br><br>it’s funny, bc the first time i read franny &amp; zooey, i was around 14 and going through a confucianism phase that would snowball into [insert series of the philosophy and spirituality scouring that you do when you’re a teenager looking for something in place of religion as you form your identity] so its original appeal to me was very much franny’s story. i had like. maybe a mild literary crush on zooey. but the narration style and erratic rhythm of his novella felt secondary to how tangible and introspectively alive and in-the-moment reading franny’s story was. i mean, the restaurant bathroom breakdown, the slowly but steadily growing unhinged-ness of her disillusionment, the eventual catatonia — franny was so knowable, and so young, and so vulnerable. she’s what every teenager needs as a mirror on the page, maybe exactly bc she was allowed room to have what would be easy for us to write off as simple elitism and moral superiority. <br><br>so it was interesting to do this reread and realize i’ve moved from my franny era to being completely and unapologetically zooey 😭 i have so much to say about the execution of this novella now that i have more brain cells to spare about writing technique and all that stuff but there’s just something so flesh-and-blood in zooey. franny’s vulnerability — and i mean that as both the character and the short story — was swollen and bare-faced and light-headed and raw exactly bc it’s at the beginning of... something, but zooey’s is all stages of grief at once. it’s anger and denial and the need to both protect And defend one’s self. it’s all the complexity of loving something that can’t love you back bc of the way the world works as well as resenting someone who’s no longer around to make it right and free you from that complexity. zooey was just. he was like a cut that cannot heal bc the person keeps picking at it. maybe even bc he Doesn’t want it to heal.<br><br>god. franny and zooey is literally perfect, huh. i have no notes. it’s infuriating. i feel you so much on wanting to write an essay about it. all this to say thank you so much for dropping by to let me know you read it bc there is never a point where i’m not screaming about it in my head. a refreshing punch to the gut is exactly right. it’s a paradox made perfect, that goddamn book. makes you understand why catcher in the rye was all the rage with The Youth when it was released, if this is how people felt about that one. but you know what, life is too short not to be shameless about the books that made you see the exact depth of your human-ness, for better or for worse. this one definitely did for me.</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhhh that is an extra tricky one 😢 i think you word it really well in phrasing it as an “addiction” to comfort. this is just my personal philosophy, for context, but i’m a today’s pain is tomorrow’s gain kind of guy. i love comfort in my own way, but i also tend to get fixated on how some present pains are necessary exactly bc it will ensure my comfort in the long run. it will pain me More to deny future me comfort, or to ensure Only short-lived comfort. how comfortable can i be right now, really, if i’m inhibiting my possibilities in the larger scheme of things? i can’t be comfortable if i’m not comfortable forever/for the majority of my long-term life. ofc this perspective has its own cons but i’ll put up with a lot if it means minimizing discomfort in the future. even if it’s something like folding clothes i really don’t want to touch right now just so i won’t crash into bed later with that pile still crowding a corner of my room. that’s how life is for me. metaphorically speaking, the less tabs of unread articles i’ve left open, the more processing power i have to spare for other things, and therefore the more comfortable i am. i just wouldn’t call it comfort otherwise. if “comfort” comes at the expense of my future/what’s necessary, that’s closer for me to blissful ignorance and/or willful negligence. <br><br>but it truly is difficult, i know. discomfort alone takes more mental/emotional energy than we expect, and it can be discouraging to always brace yourself for exhaustion. that said, i like to think of comfort as a matter of relying on neural plasticity. the beginning will always be the hardest, whether it’s a social dynamic or working out or a job or life in a new city. most beginnings won’t be comfortable — that is just how the life formulas balance out — which also means that choosing to be comfortable all the time can at times train an inability to weather any kind of beginning in life altogether. does this make sense?<br><br>insert caveat about the capitalist machine that is the job market, but more simply, more harmlessly, the brain power you use to choose comfort is the same amount you might use getting accustomed to something uncomfortable. it might not feel that way, bc familiarity is unconscious, and of course this rule is Not universally applicable, but the illusion that you’re not using up energy by choosing to stay comfortable in the present can often come at the cost of leaving that for your future self to deal with Anyway. do they not deserve to be comfortable, too? <br><br>all the same, everyone has their own circumstances. i’m speaking really broadly and impersonally here. i just happen to be of the casual opinion that it’s far more comfortable in the long run to distribute discomfort in smaller chunks than to leave all of it for just another version of myself to deal with. then again, i have also been told i consider the future too much. so. please take this with a grain of salt. a mountain ridge of salt, even.</div>

 <div class=reply>it has been on constant repeat since release! it’s always a slow run-up for me when we get a new mitski era, but i know eventually something will click into place and i’ll be 200% absorbed into the new album. i love how each of her albums have had a different — world? sometimes songs feel like colours, and those colours feel like sensations, but with mitski, it’s always a wider more encompassing version. like small planets viewed from a spacecraft. small galaxies. not small cities or images but an entire galaxy. while bury me in makeout creek remains my objective favourite, land is inhospitable was just. everything you want the follow-up to laurel hell to be. laurel hell was suffocating in its heartbreak, but inhospitable is like being allowed infinite fresh air. there’s a bit here that’s echoed between the two albums (buffalo replaced and heat lightning are chord siblings in my head, for instance, in the same way that i love me after you and i guess are thematic twins) but when listened to in the track list order, heaven is what takes the album to a new direction and for the better at that. it’s like… like wings unfurling? that’s the feeling the album gives me. not necessarily taking flight, but unfurling. the weight of those wings tugging at your back, but also the unburdening sensation of having them freed. <br><br>this album had so many things i’m weak for: religious themes in the lyrics, a cosmic tone in the production, a cyclical inevitability to each song that makes them more than brilliant even as standalones. star was my immediate favourite upon release, but for a time after the full album drop, i thought the deal might replace it. i don’t know if it truly did? star still moves me beyond describing, and not just bc i love anything celestial, while i love the deal more from like… the vantage point of writing appreciation. or something. idk. the deal sustains a strong narrative in a way i’d love to see more from mitski. i mean, the image of stumbling upon a bird perched on a streetlight while you’re out on a walk and making a faustian bargain to be absolved of the burden of being yourself, only for it to amount to nothing in the end? one of my all time mitski favourites. <br><br>this album just contained some of her lyrical best, like the opening lyrics of the frost and even those viral verses from my love mine all mine. when memories snow is also So evocative, and its words play so deftly with metaphors and multiple definitions of the same word. they just feel secure, the lyrics in this album. i think i’m your man is the weakest/most overrated song in the album, but i also know it appeals to a certain subsection of people. so. it has its merits. i don’t like my mind is similarly not as lyrically robust as the rest, but the melody/production elevates it. <br><br>all in all another no skip for me from mitski ☺️</div>

 <div class=reply>hello! i have not, unfortunately… it Was high on my radar, but i saw someone’s neutral review on it and kind of just. set it aside for the meantime bc idk if novels about loneliness and connection are what appeal to me right now.<br><br>that said, i have no idea what i even want from novels these days; i feel like nothing i give a shot scratches the itch i need it to, but i can’t locate where the itch even is. so i very well could pick up all the lovers in the night tomorrow or in a year, who knows, but for now, i’m sorry i have no thoughts to share :(</div>

 <div class=reply>non-human humans, it seems. or human non-humans? or — no, not the best approach to it, actually. hm. whatever you call the category that encompasses automatons, androids, angels, puppets, machines, magical girls, mecha pilots, beings otherwise human yet were raised to carry no more than the function of a machine or an ornament, even heirs to both literal and metaphorical thrones. <br><br>all technically in line with characters i usually love anyway, but it’s taken on more shape this year. part of it is bc i was thinking during the spring anime season that i don’t know how much more i can handle of shoujo characters being set up to not think much of romance only to be fixed/cured/changed by that one special person. maybe i’m just bored of the impulse to ~humanize, for lack of a better word, characters who haven’t had that experience/privilege to begin with, or at least to present a love interest as a vehicle for that humanizing. it just leaves a bad aftertaste in its implications, and that led me to thinking about how i might want stories/arcs like this to be told. what’s the alternative to having a Cold, Stoic, Strategic Archetype Who Doesn’t Care About What People Think come alive bc of a “Painfully Human,” Sentimental, Emotional Archetype Who Does Care And Wants To Be With People? but there’s no escaping that narrative. there’s something people find fundamentally wrong about the former archetype, i guess. something to be fixed or nudged towards Human Connection in the only right way there is. as if the childhood they Did have is something to be overwritten completely instead of a fundamental part of who and what they are. skip to loafer is doing a really interesting subversion of that point right now, but i digress.<br><br>all the pieces of media i’ve loved recently that fall into all this are the employees by olga ravn and elan ceres from gundam: witch from mercury (which is my fav of the franchise so far, easily, even if i maintain that there was plenty it chickened out of when it shouldn’t have). i’ve also done some revisiting of media i’ve loved for nearly all my life to reevaluate it for this theme, including urasawa’s pluto, of which the anime was incredibly disappointing but a recent reread of the manga delivered even more than i expected it to. urasawa is at his best when his arm is twisted behind his back. <br><br>otherwise, not many dominant/fixation-level media obsessions. i’ve been jumping from good book to good book and haven’t had much time in between except to reconsume oldies but goodies. been rewatching some of my all time fav movies, including last year at marienbad, and i finally got around to watching the second season of link click. but yeah. very all over the place these days, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. makes me wonder if i’m finally growing up and away from my capacity to be obsessive in my media consumptiom, or if i’m now finding other ways to channel energy that would have accounted for obsession before. idk.</div>

 <div class=question>thank you so insanely much for the writing advice!!! i honestly feel like that’s something i really needed to hear, and hearing something conceptual instead of just a rigid step-by-step “this is how to improve your writing” type of thing is already really helpful. and the last line of what you wrote. wow. i most definitely needed to hear that too. i can’t improve if i don’t write out of fear that it won’t be perfect. it honestly motivated me to pick back up one of my half-abandoned projects yesterday and im really happy with how it’s going 🥹 thank you again so much</div>

 <div class=reply>I’M GLAD. I’M SO, SO GLAD. relieved that my nonsense could offer direction but also just glad on a personal level. i know it’s been a while since you sent this in but i hope writing has continued to be kind with you… or that you have continued to be kind to writing. if more conceptual writing advice is helpful to you and you’re looking for something to read here and there to get the spark going, steering the craft by ursula k. le guin has been the only “writing book” that has had me all [drake pointing and smiling meme] instead of 😐<br><br>slightly related, but an animator friend of mine was taking a class once where the instructor dedicated a unit to starting a new sketchbook and how this often comes with a feeling of “preciousness” — this sense of oh the first clean page of this sparkling new sketchbook needs to look a certain way. which can be a paralyzing mentality, enough that people often don’t end up just drawing, whether badly or well. the instructor suggests a bunch of things — start from the middle, open to a random page every time, throw the sketchbook at a wall or beat it up a bit so the cover/spine doesn’t feel so uncracked and pristine — and that advice really stuck with me in my own process, even if there isn’t quite the same physical material of having a sketchbook. so. <br><br>i’m an advocate for bastardizing craft, i always say — or at least i try not to hold the writing process to any sort of purity. maybe i’m disillusioned about any actual power writing may have, or maybe it’s just that i don’t think it’s something for me to take pride in, but either way, i do believe perfectionism of any capacity needs a target. cioran wrote once that failure is a very pure idea, and therefore a valuable resource. immediate success can’t give you direction; it can’t even tell you what it is exactly that you did right. i think that applies to writing, too. <br><br>thank you for updating me!! cheering you on and wishing you nothing but an attentive mind and an active page 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>no rnbc for now confirmed, yes :( i almost cracked after the halloween event thing, though. thank god rnbc lore unfolds mostly behind the scenes since they’re not in isagi/nagi’s radars in the current arcs and both bllk universe stories are told from their perspectives alone, but if something reanimates me now that rin and the other pxg boys have come home — we will see! i’m feeling rusty and need a quick warm-up. if rnbc is available, i might be there in a heartbeat.<br><br>everything’s formally been abandoned, but if it’s of any interest, this is the full list of rnbc wips i had going for a time! feel free to ignore, etc.<br><br>1. time loop canon verse fic set during isagi’s wedding and inspired by this: https://twitter.com/ninsstosa/status/1631721056364015616?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw (parts of it were repurposed and moved to so it goes)<br><br>2. so it goes in bachira’s pov. this would have just ended up a dump of headcanons,especially since so it goes rin didn’t leave much room for reflecting on their actual history pre-injury. <br><br>3. college student bachira does odd jobs around campus to fund his severe wanderlust and through a series of events and thanks to mutual friend isagi bachira is hired by acclaimed actor rin to pose as his fake boyfriend at a dinner with sdse and basically give those two as much a headache as they give rin. ofc things don’t go according to plan, bachira’s themes of insatiable hunger come into play, maybe there was accidental marriage that i never got to in the second chapter. shidou is a formula 1 driver and sae is a retired actor turned wunderkind director. plus another attempt at sneaking in aro nagi. this was overall a fun universe… pre-2020 me could have finished it<br><br>4. vampire bachira attempt # 1, exes rnbc, gourmet cuisine universe. bachira is a sommelier bc the idea of a vampire being a wine expert is a gold mine of imagery. they had a hostile, immature break-up (a rarity in the cityboys cinematic universe, i thought) before bachira was turned and now it’s up to rin, five years later, to put whatever their relationship was worth back together. <br><br>5. vampire bachira attempt # 2, exes rnbc again, but this time bc i just wanted to write really rich young adults chasing each other across the globe while their pr teams and bodyguards run around in panic. everyone is a rich nepo baby here, except bachira, who came upon wealth mostly bc of yuu’s art taking off. wanted to explore some bits about class and commodity here, in the context also of the commodification of literal human beings when they become something to feed from.<br><br>6. vampire bachira attempt # 3, established relationship rnbc, danseur bachira in a production of giselle not realizing he’s been turned. my fav of the vampire attempts, and inspired by the deal by mitski. highest likelihood of being resurrected from the gdoc grave.</div>

 <div class=reply>you are a genuine trooper omg thank you for the absolute patience with my rambling that this would have required… i was thinking the other day that i should pay someone to organize all my answers into a carrd/page so i had like. a table of contents. but then i almost started writhing on the ground at what a horribly self-aggrandizing idea that is. i’d throw up if i had easy access to some of the stuff i was going on about three years ago on here, probably. some of the writing in those ccs… i don’t even want to think about it. thank you so much for putting up with 800+ answers worth of word vomit.</div>

 <div class=reply>CRYING don’t worry you weren’t missing anything big !! i got a cc once that was like. hey. love your writing but god do your titles have to suck that much. which was such a mundane item that i posted about it, prompting the person to come back for a second round and let me know that the number of hits on a fic is not a marker of its quality, etc. which is. obvious. ofc. but the whole situation snowballed into basically a misreading of how invested i actually am in [waves at statistics and popularity politics and moralizing/absolutism/what-about-ism of the echo chamber that is fandom] hence the wink wink nudge nudge joking that has cropped up here and there since. it never was and never would be that serious. even my housemates still joke about that cc without knowing the full context… it’s just too available 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>when i finished trust by hernan diaz i thought nothing else will come close for the rest of the year in how it reanimated something dead inside my brain but i’m in my olga ravn era right now and the employees gave me open heart surgery. both trust and the employees played into my thematic fixations of the year, to be fair, so i’m a little biased, but. i think you can sum up my current taste in stories with this section from the employees:<br><br>“I know I’m only humanoid and that it’s not the same. But I look like a human, and feel the way humans do. I consist of the same parts. Perhaps all that’s needed is for you to change my status in your documents? Is it a question of name? Could I be a human if you called me so?” <br><br>coincidentally, my work by olga ravn (which i paused reading bc it was going too well and i was feeling slightly drunk off it) contains echoes of my fav section in trust. full circle obsessions are at work here. here are my thoughts on trust if you’d like to give them a read: https://literal.club/regressor/book/hernan-diaz-trust-vo7mn no obligation to! it’s quite incoherent. and my review of the employees is essentially just a short journal entry: https://literal.club/regressor/book/the-employees-6qa3y</div>

 <div class=reply>jane austen… queen of the exes trope to me… this is a massive honour, genuinely, and too high a bar. thank you, thank you, seriously. i’m glad there’s something in how my characters? narratives? convey love that can resonate across all the things each reader carries. like, what a crazy notion!! what a crazy reality. love ricocheted across different people. insane. thank you for taking the time to write to me, and for your sweet words 🩷</div>

 <div class=question>hey sha, <br><br>long time, no see. or well, long time no random message to be dropped into your lap from my end i suppose. i don’t particularly remember the question i asked you last time about enneagram in general but i do remember you replying to my anon with an inner reflection that alternatively said “why are you dissatisfied with your job in corporate” etc. pretty much on the same line, differently ascribed i suppose.<br><br>my answer to this i guess (if you were still wondering) is the pretence of it all. i wouldn’t mind if corporates didn’t care to be honest. but having to deal with their pretence of the act of caring that they’ve adopted to gain more traction in various levels of society in general and that we’ve all accepted on some level to go along with because our choices are growing more reduced by the day in terms of what a “high-earning” job even looks like anymore and having to deal with expense as knife to my throat like everyone else in this time of late stage capitalism every damn day, truly makes me wonder what any of us have done to deserve such a fate. i particularly hate how i’m betraying any personal connection or fulfilment i’d gain doing anything else work-wise instead of what i’m continuing to pursue and such hamster-wheel internal guilt trips keep swallowing me whole. lol <br><br>when did everything just grow reduced to the money alone? and when did my hand get twisted behind my back l to have to work for the same organizations i was hoping to help regulate when i was still an idyllic idiot in undergrad? <br><br>i know when it happened timeline wise but i’m not sure when it happened internally. when i made that shift and now i can’t seem to unshift and i continue to have to shift because i have to do this damn job. my hands are tied. my choices left are either earn in this way or let my family destroy their bodies to deal with their accumulative debts all on their own. the former seems somewhat bearable on most days in comparison to the contemplation of choosing the latter.<br><br>uhhhhhhhh, i think this was a bit much ☠️ in terms of the answer to that question. sincere apologies for the oversharing. really didn’t mean to ramble so much.<br> <br>i was reading your last huckleberry letter (i know i’m pretty late) and felt like reaching out. the bit about you and tom sawyer having a certain conversation outside of her apartment building and you reflecting on it - really struck a chord. your voice is so clear sometimes. i hope you keep it safe.<br><br>setting this aside, how are you doing in terms of life in general? are you reading anything new? i’m obsessed with hozier’s new album currently! i especially enjoyed butchered tongue :) and i hope you give it a listen - something about its entire core seems right up your alleyway. <br><br>- regards, sei</div>

 <div class=reply>oooooh i feel you a lot on this! i try so hard not to be disillusioned with my current job situation bc — idk. i refuse to give them the satisfaction of breaking me down. i refuse to be one more person that the corporate grind has oiled up to a shine before adding to their assembly factory system. but i do seethe plenty. at times maybe even unfairly. i’m lucky, really, to have the work and financial situation i do. i can say that bc i’ve been in a position much worse, and the life i have now, even with debts that aren’t mine and all, would have seemed like a dream to the me of just two years ago. but it also feels sometimes like that’s something i’m just telling myself so i don’t clatter to rock bottom and realize i’m just sustaining a lie. <br><br>i guess i just mean to say that i understand. coping mechanism or not, should your work/financial life be something that requires coping in the first place? no, right? and like. this is easier said than done, but are there any avenues that can be just yours? i know sometimes we start falling into cycles of My Life Sucks And There’s Nothing I Can Do About It and spiral into the things we Could have been doing if our lives just didn’t suck, but often that blinds us into seeing faults in that bulletproof truth. it doesn’t make it any less true, bc yes, life under capitalism sucks so, so much, and all our arms ARE tied. but make sure it’s never a choice, to truly have no other options. i often think — if you have to meet your older self, and they ask you, “did you really do your best?” can i honestly say i did, even if only for the sake of pride? can i sneer back and say “you have no idea how hard i was trying” and not only mean that defensively? <br><br>i really am sorry, sei. i know i can be blind to how hard life can feel for others, if not outright unfeeling, but for what it’s worth, i’m proud of you for sustaining yourself and the demands of your life despite everything. i’m sorry it has to come with despite. i won’t pretend like i’m offering solutions that have any weight. but i’m squeezing your hand. i hope there’s someplace you can put it all down. <br><br>on my end… i have fallen in love with olga ravn’s work, and have been rereading some of thomas ligotti’s short stories. but no, i haven’t listened to the new hozier, actually! i usually wait for the pull of interest to check out new things from even artists i enjoyed before, and it hasn’t happened with this one yet. i’ll keep this rec close to heart, though, as i will you saying “your voice is so clear sometimes. i hope you keep it safe.” my heart squeezes every time i reread that. thank you for the clarity of Your words, and for trusting me with something inescapably personal. <br><br>p.s. if i had to pick between 9 or 4, i’d go for 4 🙂</div>

 <div class=reply>no but this actually means a lot considering i think i cornered that person into an unwanted crisis. or exacerbated one, at least. i sounded maybe a bit too much like i’m playing devil’s advocate. that’s a privilege, too, to be able to offer input with more scope than the person experiencing it. the luxury of being on the outside, and seeing more. no such thing as objective truth, though, etc. rationality is the weapon of someone who hasn’t lost anything in the battlefield or whatever. <br><br>but no, seriously, thank you, saira. for your update and for everything: all your comments and replies across the years, for this. i hope all continues to be gentle with you. i can’t deny a part of me is like. i’ll fight her for you. send me in, coach. but that’s not fair to you or to her. all that matters to me is there is peace in your life after all this. that there’s a self you can continue to preserve. so. cheers to saira’s life !! 🥂</div>

 <div class=question>[part ii: the unfuckening] this is getting so long &amp; i know i said id spare u the details 😭 um. in any case: i was faced with how unkind i could be. faced with my tendency to think i could make up for it in the other ways i expressed my love and care, in acts of service and so on. to narrate my issues and my anger, to overwrite what others say about me. this does not mean what she did was perfectly alright, but the truth is that this pattern of behavior is one that wasn't isolated to my experiences with her. even in these messages i am sending to you, i have been narrating, packaging these people in my warped perception of them. in the end i think it is worth learning and bettering the personal from the things i read and study—post truthism and all that, something we spoke about under your post quoting mark fisher—there's a debate that gayitri spivak (splicetoday.com/on-campus/debate-on-postmodernism-1984, a truly phenomenal person, so influential in south asian scholarship and subaltern studies) has had where she talks about having radical vulnerability, radical acceptance. so here is me, bearing so many embarassing details from my personal life, to the point that it is excruciatingly personal, in a way that will have me hiding my face in the shower i will take after i am done sending this. and in this radical vulnerability being particularly accepting of my limitations, that all knowledge in this material universe is ultimately based on that which we cannot prove (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S3aH-BNf6I), &amp; i refuse to perish like a dog, so. <br>i apologised to her. i told her that i had been extremely unfair to her, weaponizing her perception of me to make it seem like there was undeniable unfairness in how i was being treated. when in reality given how kind she is, though i could feel some distance growing between us, she was never, for even an instant, unkind to me. i ended up telling her, during the summer break, months later that i didn't think we could be friends anymore. i think, in my friends, i need some amount of harshness, where we can both express issues to each other before they grow underneath our skins like cysts, to burst one day--and i think it is fair, on my part, to seek a reciprocal friendship, and to find ways to not hurt people.<br>the scenes today are interesting: i don't have many friends at all anymore. i lost a lot of them due to my tendency to isolate, one that grew during the time i was figuring myself out better—and my closest friend is the same dude, still. he kind of gently urged me towards seeing my unkindness. he has done more for me than he ever should have. she's been accusing him, though, of being my lawyer through all this, and reducing her problems. it's sort of ended sour there too, and has been souring this side of the fence as a result. but i'm happy. i'm growing. life is kind. i love to cook and read and eat fruit. thank you for your unknowing contribution to some of this growth. love, saira.</div>

 <div class=reply>that’s an indispensable trait, i think. to welcome harshness from your friends. often i think there’s no trust quite like the ones you develop for people who can see the shape of you and your life enough to make evaluations/judgments of it, let alone criticism they can trust to remain constructive on your end. when you’re the type to seek out things that feel like knowledge — may it be information, perception, even absolution — there’s a tendency to rule out the possibility of subjectivity, when any objectivity coming from one source is still by nature subjectivity. maybe, even, we expect that if we cover all our bases, if we find terms and evidence to support the conceptual, the abstract, the emotive, we will not have to be put under the microscope ourselves. it’s a weird paradoxical existence. makes me wonder whether we want or don’t want to be witnessed. in any case, i caution at the danger of self-flagellation becoming the opposite of self-awareness, but i did wanna say that i really, really admire your embracing of the vulnerability that comes with… you know. putting yourself out there. out here. putting into words as many angles to one truth as possible. i’m a big believer in narrative as performance by default. so. again. mark fisher post-truth moment. to choose a truth is vulnerability in itself.<br><br>(slight aside: it’s interesting you bring up gayitri spivak here bc i actually was introduced to her philosophy at one of my first jobs of all places)<br><br>i find that, with my own capacity to be unkind, as you phrase it, the most i can do is to really just. not let anything fester. it is so easy to. a part of me always thinks of ways parts of me and someone else can be used, weaponized, weighed if ever a conversation comes up that would need to be won. but that’s not how you do relationships. you don’t “win” relationships. you express what’s true to you, and they theirs. that’s all there is, for better or for worse. i think hurt that can ruin relationships isn’t in the inflicting of the wound; that, we can’t avoid. hurt is in the wounds we let get infected. that’s what’s truly unkind to me, to ourselves and to the people we love: when we think a relationship is worth an infection and no more. that’s the only thing i can apply broadly as someone who has ended relationships in every possible way. <br><br>the important thing to me is you’re happy, and that you’re not happy bc you’re deliberately not seeing certain pieces about what happened. that you live knowing what that life contains. work that’s all you, in the end! so! give yourself due credit!</div>

 <div class=question>[this is part i: the fuckening] hi, thank you so much for your answer &lt;3 i have returned months (and one persistent summer) later to give you an update and some details of sorts. before which—i wanted u to know that in these few months i have now become ur mutual 😳 &amp; it has made me so very surprised and pleased in the stupidest (i mean the nice kind of stupid) way! the difficult conversations were had a long time ago! i had hurt someone—and i will come off extremely cold in this—who was immature, and non confrontational to the point where i could not ask her if she had any problem with me, with anything, even with the temprature of a cup of chai i'd served her. this does not change that i had hurt her, nor did it absolve me of anything. i took your advice to heart, as well as, embarassingly, chat gpt—who summarised god knows how old wikihow articles and some blingy webmagazine tips and stuff. in the end i had to bear my heart to someone, to be kind and thoughtful and genuine. she and i had become a close friend with in the first year of law school, and as most first-year-friendships go, you get far to close and burn your wings. a lot of complicated things happened? i really don't know how much detail u r down for because as i am drafting this message it takes a turn for the gossipy side for some reason—so i will rephrase and spare you the gorey details: i had begun sleeping with a mutual friend of ours, and as time passed, him &amp; i grew very close. as time went on we sort of hung out in threes at times, and i am the kind of person who goes non verbal in group settings: i love to enjoy my friends' presences, to half-listen to their talking and perhaps read alongside them, watch the nature around us. stuff like that. i really hadn't thought much of it, as i always make it a point to express my preference for spending time one-on-one, and often did so with both of these people whom i really cared about. the issue grew when she'd tell me her issues about him, our now-common close friend—things about how distant he is—and i'd take time to reassure her. what i hadn't really known was in this time she had also been expressing her problems to him, having to do with her perception that i... was pretty much only using her to fuck him. he told me about this in confidence—and i broke his trust, blinded by how hurt i was by this, (apologizing to him was a whole different story, took all but me kind of stumbling through it, him flicking me in the forehead saying he really dgaf and telling me to go think about how i was to apologise to her 😭. in fact it was you, chatgpt, and him whose advice kind of had conversations in my mind in the run up to the date i'd chosen to apologise to her, far enough from our exams and close enough to our leaving for the end of year break) and in that blindness sort, at the tail end of a high, bitched at her face for refusing to see me as a person. it was shot after shot and she was quiet through all of it.</div>

 <div class=reply>i know (now) that we’ve had other interactions since and outside of this situation, but i’m still oddly grateful that you thought to give me an update 😭 idk. a lot of the time any “advice” i give on cc feels very… hierarchical? like i’m forcing someone into the position of a supplicant and they have to just take any words i throw at them without an opportunity for discussion. i know it’s just inherent to the format of an anonymous inbox, but idk. it feels sometimes like i’m making a choice that i should never make for another person. so. it’s nice when there’s continuity. to the interaction. if that makes sense.<br><br>all that said, thank you for taking my “advice” to heart (i keep putting that word in quotes bc i really do hesitate to attach any weight to it that seems like i’m taking credit for anything here) but oh my god. jesus. i mean, you bring up radical vulnerability in your next message, and we can talk about that there, but i think it’s interesting how there’s an impulse here to… not intellectualize, exactly, but there’s an impulse to arrange and rearrange the facts in the aftermath that to me reflects how intense they must have been in the moment. bc i truly feel as if… if you had seen all this then, if you had known exactly what you were dealing with before, you definitely would have known how to use them. you say that you were faced with how unkind you could be, which i relate to greatly enough as to be biased about it, but i think it’s less lack of kindness and more just an act of trying to find compromise where once you did not have enough details. i’m glad you’ve found transparency with yourself and reflected on a tendency to sort of interpret people for them and without their input, but i also think that’s a far less unkind instinct than something you must consider yourself cruel/cold for. human beings wouldn’t assume things for other people if our interactions with each other didn’t rely on assumptions to be interactive at all, you know what i mean?<br><br>i guess i’ll end this part of the messages with saying that i think it’s perfectly fine to apologize for How you approached something without having to apologize for the something at all. hurt isn’t mutually exclusive, though ofc the challenge is when we encounter people to whom the enormity of someone else’s hurt seems a threat to the validity of theirs. but anyway!</div>

 <div class=reply>oh dear. oh my goodness. i... think it’s isolating enough as it is to graduate the year you’re “supposed” to, that it gets worse the more years you feel like you miss — but early is its own thing, and i can’t even imagine what that must be like. we place so much value in shit like. being wiser than your age. being gifted and “ahead.” but i think certain things in life are expected to take this or that amount of time exactly bc that’s how long they take at minimum. as impressive as it is for you to graduate high school early, there’s a reason people are usually x age when they enter a period in life. it’s a huge ask of yourself, to adapt completely, and through no fault of your own. so i just… am sorry, to start, at how it must feel right now. <br><br>a lot of the time the only thing we can do in a new environment is to keep busy. you don’t have to be a social butterfly, or to have a bunch of extracurriculars and networking opportunities if that’s not the kind of person you are. filling is not the same as compensating, bc the latter attaches a responsibility to an otherwise harmless thing. but sometimes you just need to help the days pass by until they start doing it on their own. college seemingly presents so many natural ways to meet people that we intrinsically expect those ways to fall into our lap, but everyone in college is concerned only with their own self journeys of becoming a person. you gotta nose yourself into opportunities that traverse the gap, open yourself up to the trial and error of the social environments that work for you, bc everyone is too busy with their own selves. you all have self-centred reasons to seek each other out, and you’re in a perfect microcosm to explore solutions to isolation. that, and college is the perfect time to fuck around. not only is Everyone fucking around, everyone is so caught up in their own fucking around to truly pay attention to someone else’s. it’s the most alienating kind of freedom there is, but it’s still a kind of social free-for-all that you won’t get anywhere else. <br><br>there’s always stuff going on at college, even when you don’t seem to hear about it. there’s always some guy watching a movie in the lounge on thanksgiving weekend while everyone else goes home. it’s a small city, college, and that includes the edward hopper loneliness of the moments in between the loud ones. there’s a niche for you somewhere. it’s cliche to say you’re not alone, i know, and it’s rich coming from someone who didn’t do anything about their crippling social anxiety until third year, but i also know that sometimes, in our isolation, we end up furthering it by caging ourselves in. <br><br>i’m sorry that this isn’t great advice, but. there’s no way to expedite a version of yourself, only a way to keep feeding the spinning wheel more thread until it makes enough for a coat. stay safe, and let your self-making take the time it needs to unfold. i’m truly cheering you on.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, this is cool !! i Must have a few, but. i also find that i’m very particular in general about how my pairings are written and you can argue all of them are shipped under Very Specific Circumstances, technically? is that obtuse of me to say? <br>a notable case would be triads, bc it’s about balancing an equation, like rnbcis from blue lock or even the main trio from orv. but for example: itfs needs an established dynamic and a thorough renegotiation of roles bc that’s just how their relationship is. it’s built into the people they are, and it’s in fact those qualities they trust most about each other. kmtr from blue period has to acknowledge at some point the slight disproportion in their knowledge and experience with life; murai is pathologically incapable of letting himself be vulnerable, let alone around and to yatora, who in turn has a tendency to default to letting himself need advice/comforting, and has canonically struggled with not knowing how to comfort murai when it’s his turn. that kind of thing. even in an au, it won’t matter what tropes you use if it doesn’t even feel like them anymore, all bc you couldn’t spotlight the crucial core parts of who they are. some pieces about dynamics are what makes it. why change those things about a pairing when that’s exactly what we love about them? <br><br>i almost lost my train of thought there i’m sorry… i’m sure i have some for a few other older phases, but all i can think of right now are bllk pairings since it’s freshest in my mind. like kiis or ngbr. if that means anything. but i think that’s bc no one in bllk is in a stable emotional / mental state, and it will take a lot of balancing to make some dynamics work like a pairing should and not just. two characters in the same room made to carry out the routine actions expected of them in a silly little romance fic. very uninteresting to me, personally. <br><br>if i like a pairing, it’s probably for very specific reasons. so. never underestimate how insufferably strict and selective i am with characterization in fanwork 😞</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t know if there’s any continuity across all the times i’ve answered this question, but my response right now — and i’ve probably worded this a bunch of ways or attempted a different angle altogether before — is that there’s no such thing as an end to human connection. for a connection between two human beings to exist, for two entire systems of being-ness to interact in any way (whether or not the result is meaningful in the larger scheme of things) is to always exist at the beginning, forever within that initial stage of perpetual unknowability. to connect with someone is to sign up for being a mutable being around another mutable being. there’s no real way for a relationship to remain static or stagnant unless everyone involved has stopped living, literally or metaphorically, but not even death marks an end in most cases. the point of that opening section is to preface that when you choose to love someone forever, what you’re really choosing is a life with them. a life of knowing and unknowing, learning and unlearning. it’s a promise of learning to love who that person will become, and them loving who you will become. to love someone is to embrace the hard work of understanding them exactly bc it IS hard work, and to allow love all the space to evolve and reshape itself. <br><br>at least in the context of romance! i don’t totally subscribe to those thoughts myself, though, to be fair. i need to start adding a caveat to that opening section bc as grateful as i am that people take my work seriously at all, i realized too late that some readers don’t catch on to the fact that it’s mahito ranting... it’s just. a spin on his ridiculous philosophizing in jjk canon. the name of the newsletter is literally the bleach zine that akutami gege wrote in, like, middle school. not to devalue having that newsletter as the thesis statement, of course, but it’s one of those scenes that has gravity insofar as the story it helps bookend.</div>

 <div class=reply>i should probably look for the other cc i answered on this and reference it to make my thoughts easier to pin down but i think the gist of it is that i believe in a god but not necessarily The god. i guess i’m agnostic? idk if that’s quite right. i believe in creation, in something bigger than human life, but it does not necessarily have to be moral or divine. god can be whatever wondrous, bigger-than-life thing led to the big bang. god can be whatever connecting factor there is in nature. god can be whatever overlords are supervising this simulation we hypothetically live in. it doesn’t matter. i don’t agonize over which one it is, is the point. it’s just that i can’t ever be sure there isn’t a god. objectively speaking, i believe there is a tier above where we humans are, bc obviously there is. humans are imperfect and juvenile creations compared to what’s out there in the universe, whatever it might be. we don’t know, but it came from something and somewhere, just like we did. god could be a single molecular reaction. god could be a tadpole. i would still count that as a creator. <br><br>i also believe in the sanctity of creation, and i believe in the responsibility of a master. i believe in the necessity of the masses being given the concept of a god (not religion, necessarily, and especially not the corporate systems of secular religion) bc the truth is plenty of people don’t know what to do with a completely blank slate in place of their free will. <br><br>what i don’t believe in is an entity up in the heavens judging the weight of my soul and which afterlife i deserve, let alone that this being is some perfect, morally pure version of a powered up human. i don’t wholly preclude the possibility of that in my thoughts, sure, but i’ll never be diehard about it, either. i also don’t believe in moral expectations outside of my own self. i was raised extremely catholic, and i love and miss catholic rituals, but i’ve never subscribed to catholic beliefs for better or for worse. i pray, but it’s the repetition and rituals i do it for; i have my superstitions, and i believe in ghosts and spirituality, but it’s never to the point of guiding religious ethos. i think it’s a flawed attempt at inducing order in your life and the world to moralize any one way just bc some god told me to. <br><br>i suppose my actual answer is an easygoing shrug? or at least it’s that line in trust by hernan diaz that’s like. god is the most uninteresting answer to the most interesting questions. it’s such a dead end of an answer, the traditional idea of a god. it’s not that i discount it altogether, but it ranks very low in my generated mental list of the godhood that produced life as we know it.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha i'm the person asking for your perspective on donghua/manhua !! i'm so happy to know you've watched link click - that said as a big fan I can't help being a little self indulgent: are you enjoying season 2 as it's released or do you have plans to binge when the entire season is out? and what's your favorite moments with its cast or story so far? as always, take your time answering, I'm grateful how much thought you put into your cc answers, as they also induce my own.<br><br>Link click is actually the first donghua I've followed - I've always been more of a reader, and I'm lucky enough to have chinese novels translated into my mother tongue much more smoothly than into english. Which is to say - thank you for your fiction recommendations! When it comes to how chinese media portray their world building, or their narrative styles picking apart multifaceted situations, they express it much more comfortably and in detail through written words, rather than visual mediums. So even if they're not donghua/manhua, I surely would check them out as long as they tick the boxes of what stories they chose to highlight - both interpersonal relationships and societal commentary, thriller without leaving characters undeveloped, and despite all hardships along the way, the point is to reinstall hope or values, as idealistic as it may seem. i'll make sure to get started on liu xicin's works... thank you again for your answers !! of course, take your time getting through series one by one, and above all i hope you enjoy them &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>I AM SO HAPPY YOU’RE BACK I WANTED TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER SUGGESTION <br><br>the xuanhuan web novel lord of the mysteries recently released the trailer for their donghua, which is how i discovered it, but since the show won’t be out until 2025, i figured i’d throw the novel into our conversation here. it’s complete and so, so very long (as web novels often are) but its wordbuilding comes highly praised, and i have to admit i’m tempted by the steampunk mystery alone. i mean. all the stuff we said about social commentary and keeping the energy of a thriller deftly going — i imagine that translates well to steampunk. reviews seem to be really polarized, though, but i should say a lot of the criticisms appear to come from people who prefer strictly action-packed web novels. so if you wanted to check it out, the title is lord of the mysteries / guimi zhi zhu / 诡秘之主.<br><br>as for link click, i do have plans to binge now that the entire season is out! i don’t know why i’m so reluctant to just dive in. i guess i’m worried it will fall short after season 1? i think link click’s strength was that it kept its focus narrow but its possibilities broad, and when you expand the plot as season 2 seems to have no choice but to, there’s danger of picking a side out of necessity. i hope season 2 did okay on that. i’m kinda scared to find out.<br><br>i’ve wondered a lot what my fav link click story could be, and it’s a close one, but it’s probably the basketball team case. emma remains one of the only times in recent memory that a pilot episode has taken me completely aback and i cherish it so much, but the basketball team arc is (i think) the first instance of a case taking more than one episode, and i’m a sucker for how simply it balanced stakes and character-building so early in the series. there’s just so many difficult things in conflict there — ethics vs. psychology, lu guang’s objectivity and cheng xiaoshi’s subjectivity, all of which exacerbated by the fact that as much as lu guang makes the impossible happen, technically, it’s still cxs who has to be there and experience it and in the end wrestle with the aftermath. there’s a fundamental difference to both their goodwill as human beings and their approach to the job. when your role is to offer closure, what happens when that comes at the cost of you achieving closure yourself? is that a sacrifice you have to make, and if so, why can’t a change of the past be a sacrifice someone else should make? who decides what has to be sacrificed? who has the right to choose which emotions to ignore and allow to leave unanchored, and which lives to leave up to “fate” — when even time / space itself doesn’t hold them both to absolute rules? <br><br>i really should watch season 2 soon ahhh but thank you so much for coming back, and i’m glad my answers made some level of sense. i hope you’ve found something to enjoy in your recent media, and please know i’m always happy to hear whatever people are down to share 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>is everyone revisiting the iliad this fall or something... it’s intriguing how many people i’ve spoken to recently are on the same boat<br><br>but the translation i’m most partial to is fitzgerald’s, funnily enough! it’s not really known for its faithfulness to the greek; people usually go for lattimore’s on that, i think, and i’ve heard people advocate for verity’s as well, though i wasn’t a huge fan of either and hated fagles outright. fitzgerald was the first that didn’t make me feel like it was trying so hard that i wanted it to be over for both of us. some translations Reek of desperately wanting to capture the original voice of the source, and while i’m a sucker for staying grammatically faithful / encompassing, i feel like the task of a translator only begins with grammar. a text is still a text, even in adaptation. it should stand on its own. plus ancient greek is an intricate language, with elements we don’t have in english, and i feel like it defeats the point to try and batter english into a shape it doesn’t naturally form. <br><br>fitzgerald is a nice example of someone who i feel captures the vibe of the original greek and wields english liberally to convey it, even if it means forgoing some of the traditionally homeric elements of the language, like the epithets for the olympians... which i find so... lame... in english. we don’t need to hear about “swift-footed” achilles any more than i want to read a novel that keeps referring to a named main character as The Blond. pretty as it is in the greek, with how many constructions of ποδ-something actually make up the varieties of swift-footed to fit the meter, english can only allow for one version of an adjective, and i think a translator should account for that, as anne carson does in her own translations of the tragedians. otherwise, it’s corny enough to be a dealbreaker for me. <br><br>i did hear emily wilson recently released a translation, and it seems to be well-received. i’m glad she’s translating, god knows we need more women translators in classics, but as groundbreaking as the opening line of her odyssey was (“tell me about a complicated man”), and as much as it invites new engagement with the text, i’ll always be partial to fitzgerald’s approach to homer, which translates that exact same odyssey opening line as “sing in me, muse, and through me tell the story / of that man skilled in all ways of contending.” <br><br>but all this is based purely on personal taste and preference, especially what i consider a deal breaker. it’s about writing style, about individual attachment to the greek, about how much of the story you want to leave up to interpretation. there are even a bunch of decent prose translations up online for free. it just happens that i don’t love the post-modernist, contemporary sparse style of prose / poetry, but all robust translations, as do all styles of writing, have merit to them. so do take my opinions with a grain of salt !!</div>

 <div class=reply>rafaela !! i’m so late to this that it’s like. nowhere close to summer anymore. but it remains very endearing to hear you spent it neck-deep at one point in gracie abrams music (and might be, still) ☀️<br><br>the first ever gracie song to leave an impression on me is stay so i have an eternal soft spot for it :( i also love unlearn and mean it. from this is what it feels like, my favs are rockland, for real this time and feels like. i was writing a bunch of different romance-heavy stories around the time these songs came out, to be fair, so that might have played into my attachment to these songs. but i do genuinely think rockland is gorgeously produced, and i’m always struck by how much i feel for the songs in this is what it feels like whenever i revisit it after a while away.<br><br>good riddance took a long time to grow on me, and i’m not sure the entire album totally has, but right now is unequivocally my fav song on it. i also really like the blue. i’d say good riddance feels like the older, more mature version of this is what it feels like, in that the narrative-building is much stronger and more grounded, but there’s a young, open rawness to this is what it feels like that’s hard to beat. i also prefer the vocals in this is what it feels like a lot more, though i do enjoy some lyrics on good riddance, and when the melody lines are right on the money, they land strong, like the chorus of i should hate you, or feel unexpectedly cathartic, like full machine.</div>

 <div class=reply>i looooooooooove this question yes i absolutely would !! two of my manuscripts are horror. i guess the severity of the horror elements themselves vary, but an anxious culture is a superstitious culture, so horror is rendered almost always necessary in narratives of colonialism, abuse, control and lack thereof, etc. sometimes the thing haunting the narrative is an actual haunting. sometimes to be subjugated is to be made into an immortal creature that never had the chance to escape the cycle of being both predator and prey. and sometimes you can’t truly talk about the separation you feel between yourself and your body unless you put a foreign presence in there with you. <br><br>my point is i’ve been trying to write horror for [insert however long i’ve been working on this iteration of manuscript # 1] but i keep doubting my footing on it instead of just committing to freefall. i’m in this odd little limbo after my most recent au fic where even the thought of writing the same contemporary / slice of life i’ve always felt grounded in writing is yawn-inducing, but to go onwards and upwards is daunting exactly bc it’s so new and exciting. blue lock kinda turned a key in me and now the door won’t swing back shut enough to click. it’s a shame how easy it is to make jokes out of characters like bachira, rin and shidou bc the thematic weight of all their breakdowns have such horror potential, not to mention whatever the hell is going on at bastard münchen. but now that bllk has opened up access to the part of me that hungers for that sort of stuff, i’m left reflecting on some sections of hairpin turns / perfect machine and thinking to myself oh, you could have gone much bloodier with that. or oh, you let some undefined softness win here instead of the objectively better if more unsympathetic route. i think when you love your characters, no matter how terrible they are, there’s an impulse to have a reader love them the way you do. which is not always perfectly compatible for horror, or really anything that counts as a dark theme. <br><br>but that’s exactly why i’m so eager to do it with my own characters :( there’s a fair bit of reluctance when it’s characters that belong to their own canon world, but it’s much more comfortable pivoting to horror when they’re your own. the problem is that it seems i have... no functional sense... of fear and survival. i’ve done research on everything from horror films and books to all the popular horror podcasts to youtube short films to the depths of subreddit true stories, and even now i’m like. damn. there’s nothing in my code programmed to isolate what’s so scary about these. and not even in the juvenile haha scary movie funny way. it’s more like my compass for understanding human nature is going haywire <br>and i need to find a way to recalibrate. it’s a work in progress, in any case. <br><br>the short answer is yeah! i’d love to write horror in any capacity, and i do wish i had space to explore darker themes way more in a fic.</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh excellent question 🤔 i think much of writing a story is management of rhythm and tone. the craft part of it feels like vivisection; you know what you’re trying to gauge, but it might need a little gore and mess to be sure. but the actual writing is like running. you won’t reach top speed at once. you can try, but it’s nearly always better to get a walking start, gradually up your momentum, and when it’s time to stop, account for the fact that there’s no natural way for the body to just abruptly halt forward motion. when you’ve been running at top speed, stopping will be a process of slowing to a walk, and your legs will have to keep moving to burn off the momentum until it can actually physically stop. that’s what “completing” a story feels like. burning off all that energy until it depletes itself.<br><br>to get there, the story Has to have momentum. writers like to advice that stories have to feel inevitable, but i think what they mean is that it needs to have that running momentum. when i write the first draft, i tunnel vision on only thing, which is to keep it moving. i’ll do whatever it takes to do that, even if means leaving marks to return to later as i take stock of the hypothetical chess board. <br><br>i always do revision on my phone, partly bc i do so many of them and it’s more comfortable to lie down when a single round can bring one scene from 1k to 5k and partly bc there’s less of a temptation to focus on more than edits. i’d say the most “crucial” part is the first round of filling, for wherever i just dumped dialogue and left a slash to indicate that i’ll need to add speaker tags / more introspection / body language. sometimes i’ll also dump imagery markers like [snow, melancholy, quiet] and save the expanding for the revision stage. read-throughs are otherwise holistic in service of tone management. is the reasoning / pace of the dialogue hard to follow? does it make no sense for one of them to say this, or maybe there’s a different way this character would say / think the sentiment i meant to convey? is this word choice too mild for the reader to get a grasp of what this character is feeling? is it too severe? do we need an emotional break here so the reader can breathe / brace for what’s coming? revision is never just any one thing, which is why you need to be ruthless with it. once you have a story to tear apart, stitching it back together can be anything from reordering paragraphs, choosing a different setting, deleting a sentence that calls so much attention to itself that it disrupts the staccato rhythm needed for a tense scene, kicking a character out, or even scrapping the scene altogether. <br><br>as for whether a story is ready to share, though… i guess completion is the only criterion there? i need to send a story off and never think of it as solely mine again to make it final and wrap it up in my head, but sharing is more an add-on discounted service than a goal.</div>

 <div class=reply>fascinating !! though i don’t know if i do... the first one to come to mind is ode to a nightingale by john keats, which has a stanza dedicated to the narrator fumbling in a dark forest (?) and trying to name the flowers around him by smell and/or touch. it’s not explicitly about the death of a flower so much as death and ephemerality bc. you know. the romantic poets are like that. and also keats spent nearly all his life around the same illness that took him too young. which has always made me wonder what the idea of forever must feel like for someone like that. when you barely have a chance at true mortality, what do you conceive of when you imagine immortality, you know? is beauty achieved through the unachievable, like living long and comfortably, or is beauty achieved exactly bc longevity is impossible? so stanza five in ode to a nightingale has always struck me as an interesting in-between of all of that. <br><br>neruda’s sonnet 17 is also a fun subversion of the romanticism of flowers:<br><br>i love you as the plant that never blooms<br>but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;<br>thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,<br>risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.<br><br>damn i can only seem to retrieve famous poems from my high school brain tonight :( <br><br>as for a way i’d enjoy that story being told — between you and me, the rose in the beauty and the beast has always left an impression 😭 hear me out though don’t you think there’s something both so fantastical and so pitiful about beast keeping the rose in this glass dome? as if that would do Anything to the countdown until he keeps this form for good. that’s not how you keep a rose alive. the Point is that that’s not how you keep a rose alive. and to have this flower attached to the concept of beauty literally caged, held hostage as it holds You hostage, and the imagery of the petals falling as the beast remains unloving and unloved year after year. it works. <br><br>there’s this tulip in the manga pluto that’s similarly held under a glass dome, but this time it’s symbolic of the last remnant left after total war-torn wreckage of the meadow it was planted in. what if a creature borne to create life becomes the harbinger of death and hatred and revenge? what if a tulip remains of that original raison d’etre, alive after years and beyond the laws of science, hinting at the remains of the original heart inside that creature? <br><br>like. a lone flower is such effective imagery. i can’t say i’m sick of it or even immune. even hunger games knew what they had to do with rose symbolism. <br><br>but anyway. i hope this answers at least a tiny portion of your question. i apologize if it doesn’t. i’ll have to give this one more thought to have a coherent answer ready.</div>

 <div class=reply>i talk a little bit about it here (https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1602573181612605442?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw) and here (https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1680728536015929344?s=46&amp;t=jt2CClqVrHmFBOpfmaTUJw) but ​​i guess my opinion is that the phenomenon is far, far, Far more interesting than the execution, which is kinda just. there. i think a good multiverse media can be evaluated through How they execute this quote from tatami galaxy, whether or not it uses the same thesis: https://nswers.tumblr.com/post/728503600273391616. <br><br>i was talking to a book publicist a few months ago, and she was saying that the next big trend in publishing seems to be isekai, which i think poses a related tangent in terms of how we’ve graduated from a culture obsessed with the potential of possibilities and pivoted to escapism altogether, but it made me think that multiverse media isn’t really going anywhere bc it was never gone, either. it’s gotten mainstream appeal bc of marvel and everything everywhere all at once, but time loops and multiverses — which i feel are both reflections of the same desire to explore all the different ways you can do something until it yields direction towards the “right” choice — have always been useful devices exactly bc they lend themselves well to that exploration. successful and/or happy people with nothing to want will never be the focus of stories like that. whether it’s evelyn from eeaao or doctor strange or the protagonist from 13 going on 30, the very act of considering an alternate possibility and/or the weight of potential already humanizes a character the way you need a main character to be humanized. at its core, the themes of multiverse media are a shortcut to the way we all think anyway, the what ifs and the i would have or should have and the i wish i could [insert choice]. multiverse stories just wrestles that existentialism under an ordering mechanism. it’s made for easy blockbuster stories lately, but i think that’s more bc the science of multiverse worldbuilding is far more accessible now that people don’t have to be walked through quantum physics to get the general gist since they already watched two films on it.<br><br>i mean, it’s fun! let it be fun. bc there’s such a human element, multiverse media relies too much on the sentimentality of possibility, and while i do love and am guilty of a good “in another life…” moment, it’s fatiguing to be inundated with so much blatant pathos. in the end, if a piece of media uses the multiverse as the plot itself instead of just a device to introduce more layers through, then there’s only one way you can resolve that to get the story to its end, which is to have a character choose the life they started with. so. i want them to make the journey worth it, bc that same inevitable final choice itself is running out of innate merits of its own.</div>

 <div class=reply>you have nothing at all to apologize for, oh my gosh. it wasn’t meant to attack you, and i promise i wasn’t reading ill intention in your words. just — the world is big, as are words, and you are a layered and nuanced human being. so i’m gently flicking your forehead against for calling it your “faulty” way of thinking. it’s just your way of thinking to me, full stop. it means a lot, for you to return after reflection and still engage in dialogue with me after that last reply. <br><br>i mostly agree re: fiction being better than self-help books; i think self-help books have a tendency to encourage people to spiral into their own faults then leave them hanging. no matter what tools you can equip someone with to “better” themselves (which in itself is a neverending process that capitalism has hijacked and that no one else can hand to you), it’s still the equivalent of talking to an audience up on stage, telling them what to fix and how to, then walking off. memoirs and fiction, i would argue, offer more genuine connection with something you’re wrestling with. <br><br>but to be completely honest what i see is not an issue of objectivity vs. subjectivity but a tendency to be absolutist. when you make a mistake, it seems you disparage yourself heavily for it. when you feel disconnected from the world, you feel it as total aloneness. of course i’m working off conjecture, but… is it fair to say it won’t hurt to be more aware of all the shades of gray in the language you use to and about yourself? it’s So easy for the brain to encode habits of language. it takes work to unlearn the default ways of thinking your brain relies on as an immediate reaction. i know that. i think you feel everything deeply, that it’s hard for you to find a medium/neutral level to the things you experience, and that causes you to tunnel vision on what you’re feeling — which is human and understandable! what you’re feeling is big! there’s only so much of a big thing that the body can focus on in one go! i’m not telling you to change that about yourself. i feel like — there’s a lot of curiosity and want for connection in you, but sometimes, when you react to something, there’s no harm in interrogating if you’re truly allowing that reaction all the nuances possible. are you considering more than one possibility? are you maybe being extreme to yourself by calling something a failure at first try? are you catastrophizing about the worst possible scenario when there’s also a chance it might be good? <br><br>i just. feel a lot of tenderness for you. what i really mean to say underneath all this is: be kinder to all your dimensions bc it means being kinder to other people’s. but i understand internalizing this expectation of absolutes/perfection/certainty, and i apologize if i spoke out of line here or been unfair in speaking so confidently after two messages. i truly am sending you all the warmth and well wishes. i hope you are taking care as well.</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m tugging you gently to the side where we can whisper bc between you and me blue lock hasn’t released its writing chokehold on me even as the source itself has and it’s starting to concern me. usually, when i wrap up a fic, it’s like blowing out a scented candle. like. the overpowering smell of burnt wick and the scent of the candle itself, but also the leftover smoke dissipating gradually. it will be gone in a second, give it room to breathe. that kind of thing. blue lock is not gone. or at least it’s taking a while to leave me.<br><br>that said, if i had the time and energy to write the fics of my dreams, and if i wasn’t so irrationally against writing povs that veer too closely to my own, i would love to do:<br><br>— the nagi-centric spinoff to hairpin turns, exploring how lacuna/lethe came to be and his own relationship with romance. or lack thereof. idk. there’s a lot of juice to wring out from his and reo’s so-flawed-it’s-not-even-funny relationship, and it’s interesting to me where they end up in that universe and why. sometimes you write a world and it hurts to be the only one to know it and love it in totality, in all the parts of it that exists, bc some exist only in your head. that’s especially true with the hairpin turns universe. that, and there’s also so much in nagi’s ennui both canon and off that echoes in me maybe too much + i once saw someone allude to nagi’s aromantic leanings and it hasn’t left me since. but this would be too personal to write.<br><br>— a murai study, particularly on his history and relationship with physical intimacy. the hiroshima arc gave us two details that i’m mad i didn’t have when i wrote igyssr, bc there is So much i would have wanted to do with it and now i can’t bc i don’t want to do an igyssr 2.0 when everything in it still holds true to canon. but man… the fanon image of murai is So. of course i get why people are attracted to characters, and why this one, but that’s exactly what i find so interesting about reveals of murai’s history<br><br>— vampire bachira. merch line was insane for that. i toss and turn over it everyday. it’s like whoa! it’s as if his whole character is defined by a bottomless hunger that he can’t acknowledge in himself so he visualizes it as a separate entity that he can’t rein in nor satisfy all by himself! and i’m here with my hands tied!<br><br>but these are more thoughts that Could be fics, really. i can probably have fun writing a little canon study of any character in any series, and these three are persistent only bc i already had a taste of their sources. <br><br>overall, it’s hard to say. i said so it goes was my last fic at least until i finish this manuscript — which i do want to abide by. who knows what i’ll get into in the future that will have me writing for hours at a time. we shall see. but thank you for asking! i appreciate the interest, genuinely.</div>

 <div class=question>if you dont mind me asking, how did you work on improving your writing over the years? im 17 so i know i still have a long way to go, but im a bit of a perfectionist so i get easily discouraged when my writing isn’t what i want it to be. im usually praised for how straightforward my writing is, but i often feel that it’s so straightforward to the point that it lacks any uniqueness or personality if that makes sense? i know this is a bit of a loaded ask but your writing embodies everything that i want to achieve with mine so i couldnt think of a better person to ask</div>

 <div class=reply>that is a highly generous bar, wow. thank you. Whoa. (though funnily enough, straightforward is also how i’d describe my writing.)<br><br>i can’t recall if i’ve fretted over my writing voice not… voicing. 17 is the age i started writing on cityboys, and anything that’s changed since hasn’t had much to do with the words part of writing. i guess i don’t rank “uniqueness” too high in isolation when it comes to what makes good writing. i think uniqueness in prose comes alongside other pieces, bc a work is not monolithic. words have no inherent quality to them, not even beauty or truth. it might seem like they do, bc the best sentences are what james baldwin would call clean as bone, but for every perfect word at the end of a scene are other things in the background working away so the words can lead you to where the work wants you to be. with that in mind, i don’t think it’s a bad thing at all to have straightforward prose.<br><br>what matters to me is that my writing is capable of handling the story i want to tell. i think i have a journal entry somewhere saying that if i had to visualize my writing as a creature, it’d be a barb horse. sure-footed, reliable stamina, quick to learn. it’d be nice if she was pretty, but in the end, i just want to be in a carriage and not worry about being pulled forward. there’s a huge difference between being a perfectionist and a purist about what makes good writing; i would argue that the former shows you how to improve, while the latter hinders you.<br><br>this might be groan-worthy, but. getting your writing to feel intuitive can just mean... spending so much time with it that there’s no point worrying about it. to do that, you have to write. write until it doesn’t matter if you do it terribly or well bc your writing as unshakeably grounded as it is mutable. write until you can snap your fingers and tell your writing to go and it does. it’s like kita from hq!! saying that nobody gets nervous about sleeping, and it’s the same for volleyball. whatever results he gets are the side effects of the things he does everyday. i feel that way about my writing and any “improvement” i’ve seen. someone read my writing commentary on tumblr and asked why i’m so hard on myself, and maybe this is why. i’m not an extraordinary writer, but i don’t think that self-deprecatingly any more than i think i’m hard on myself. i just do what will make the rest of it easy and straightforward, and i keep finding more to tackle so i can stay in love with the process. sometimes that means diving into a genre i was sure i couldn’t do bc i can’t know what About it is daunting until i’ve done it. and i think that’s all that the path to improvement has been for me. experiencing the very absolutes of my limits, then confronting them. rinse and repeat.<br><br>i’m sorry if this is all. conceptual. and unhelpful. in the end, i just think that if i’m going to be perfectionist anyway, i might as well have something to bludgeon into perfection, and an empty doc is not that.</div>

 <div class=reply>i haven’t really listened to much elliott smith 🤔 no songs come to mind, really... say yes appears to be in one of my playlists, so it must have come on shuffle at some point/been recommended by someone. i like it, now that i’m listening to it! it’s very lua by bright eyes/we’re going to be friends by the white stripes/that era of slow arty tumblr songs that you crave here and there when you’re listening to productions that are too busy. i can get behind it. i’ll give him more listens. i’m already vibing with what i’ve heard of either/or so far (is the title of this album a nod to kierkegaard or is it just. the phrase either/or.) i’m sure i know more than one song and just am not aware that i do, and i will like a few more by the time i listen to all his albums. i can feel it.</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s actually just &lt;small&gt; !! so for example, if i want to make “cinnamon toast crunch” into a smaller size, i would type:<br><br>&lt;small&gt;cinnamon toast crunch&lt;/small&gt;<br><br>i looked up to see if ao3 has a page dedicated to what html they support, and they do: https://archiveofourown.org/faq/formatting-content-on-ao3-with-html?language_id=en but if that’s a bit too messy to navigate, i also found this: https://archiveofourown.org/works/5191202/chapters/11961779 <br><br>html is a fairly well-known way of coding text, so anything you need, it should take only one google search. and if you’re not sure whether you have the right command, there are sites like w3schools.com that offer straightforward support for nearly all the coding languages.</div>

 <div class=reply>this cc took me so long to get to that summer is basically over, but thank you for asking, first of all. that’s very sweet. summer… has felt near exactly like calla by wave to earth? kinda like. that tak-tak-boom beat. the vague nearby sound of the waves, even though you can’t really feel anything but the occasional breeze — which is still too humid to cool your face. there’s an element of like. walking barefoot down the beach at the end of a really hot day; the sand is still too warm, and it stings just a tiny bit to walk, and you’re deliberately falling behind your friends, who will notice you slowing down, they will, but right now, for the next couple of seconds, they’re occupied with talking about their whirlwind romances of the summer and dwelling on the collective rush of not being the only person in your friend group to fall for someone and have their hearts broken within weeks. isn’t that interesting? that people can find a thrill in even failed romance? i think it’s so fascinating. maybe mostly bc i’m metaphorically watching all of it while all i can feel is the warm sand and the humid breeze. and that tak-tak-boom. a little swaying motion. both the suffocation and the freedom of being able to control your presence and participation. that kind of vibe. it hasn’t been totally unpleasant. august was one of those months that tasted like only things you’re close to surviving can taste. if that makes sense. it probably doesn’t. too abstractive. idk how else to describe it. i guess there’s comfort in seeing everyone return to school and the fall season start at work and knowing that’s another summer you lived through. yeah.</div>

 <div class=question>oh no no no by all means, please keep ranting!! back when you were still writing flls i loved to read your opinions &amp; insights on canon material here on cc!! and since you seem open to talking about it, i will continue my inquiry, if that’s ok! 🤠<br><br>so, what was it abt the opening that made you emotional? did the ending make you feel the same way? what aspects of this season’s direction did you enjoy? after episode 1, what bits of jjk2 caught your attention in the good way? and what about this second season’s episodes that have come out thus far were you not particularly fond of? what did you like the most about episode 1, aside from watching the opening for the first time? is there anything specific you’re excited about season 2? what are your expectations for when they animate the shibuya arc?

 <div class=reply>no no wait — you’ve been here for that long? thank you for being here since flls was ongoing. that’s incredible. my god.<br><br>ao no sumika… my enemy. i wish i documented how quickly my face fell while i went from head bobbing to having to inhale sharply bc of “また会えるよね.” idk how official lyrics are doing it but my brain’s first parsing was “We’ll meet again, won’t we?” and it made me quietly livid. <br><br>that said, i think ambivalent is the best word to describe how i felt for hidden inventory in the manga; it wasn’t that i hated the arc, just that it was more for plot purposes than anything intrinsic to the characters and my investment in them. i can understand a person and still not love them, and the same for characters. a part of me was superficially like, “was it that serious…” about geto’s spiral in the manga, though mostly bc gege has that new gen shounen curse of Whoa Not Too Much Let’s Keep The Usual Vibes Going. i can sympathize and empathize, but my first opinion on canon stsg has always just been that — it’s done, you know? the world never gave them a chance to be anything but representative of two different worlds, but it has already happened. it was a burden they were always going to have, no matter what was different. classic tragedy of yes the love was there but it didn’t change anything. it couldn’t have, when you’ve got two people both championed by the system yet left on the outskirts of it. you can’t teeter on a thin line forever. toji was always on the clear outside, and lifelong exile became his strength. indecision became gojo’s weakness, and the need to choose became geto’s. that’s just. typical thematic juxtaposition in jjk. stsg are so deeply embedded into the plot that they’ve always just been that to me. the plot. <br><br>i still haven’t isolated where mappa added the kick, bc i thought the pacing of the middle episodes of this arc got wonky + there was a point where it felt like the animation team wasn’t on the same page as the others, which is primarily my issue with some of s2 so far. s1 was so tightly paced and divided, and s2 is very much not that, even as it experimented with a few more things that worked amazing only here and there. but all the tiny details they added to geto’s spiral worked for me at least, and i’m left with a different texture to how i’ve always felt about stsg. yes, classic tragedy. yes, it was always inevitable. yes, they Are the fabric of the story. yes, they were just kids. that was always objective truth and tragedy to me. but i do feel more willing now to be irrational with… couldn’t it have been different? couldn’t they have gotten a chance? couldn’t they do it all over again? maybe not be better people, but better young people with each other? that’s probably why those lyrics hit hard.<br><br>i’m out of space but mostly i still can’t believe we’re at shibuya already. i’ve been saying “when they animate shibuya…” for so long that this is surreal. i do not have a single thought processed.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have not 😞 if an opportunity falls into my lap, i absolutely won’t say no, but it’s not something i’ll actively seek out, either. i’m more a greta enjoyer than otherwise; she’s a writer and/or actress in quite a number of my favourite films of all time, and her two directorial projects are in my tiny little list of media that moved me bc of… recognition of the self or whatever you want to call it. <br><br>(slight tangent that you can ignore: i know people dismiss lady bird as a white suburban girl’s story and little women as this hyper-tender sisterhood story — which they both are — when almost entirely by accident, saiorse ronan’s roles in each movie are also the most i’ve seen my sensibilities onscreen? somewhere between going to an all-girls catholic school and lying about where you live bc you’re ashamed of your home situation to wanting to get away for uni to even having a nurse as a mother. and greta’s jo march being. you know. people generally read jo as not being attracted to men and that ending being complete fiction, but in my biased view, she has no attraction to anyone at all, period. her gender is another thing, and i do like that greta played with how jo has a boy's name, laurie a girl’s name, and they're each other's half-sketched half moons in that way. but i've always read jo as not being interested in romance whatsoever. my interest in her has always been in her seesaw-ing from her need for independence to her intrinsic loneliness to this internalized understanding that she loves her sisters and loves laurie deeply as her best friend but she just cannot be IN love with anyone. so. accidental mirrors onscreen, is what i’m saying.) <br><br>all this to say that i’m wary of the approach greta has taken with barbie, and that wariness is doubled by my relationship with her old work. bigger and more deliberate very rarely means better and more relatable, and while i’m glad people were having fun with barbie, it honestly just doesn’t seem like something that will turn off my brain. which isn’t to say i won’t enjoy it! i promise that’s not me sneering at the barbie fun. i loved toronto in barbie mode. it’s just that there’s a certain flavour in media like everything everywhere all at once and barbie that i fear is getting in the way of the storytelling part in service of the collective audience, who are in turn willingly lulled by the same things they claim to criticize. there’s a worrying quickness with which the same people who disparage the mcu embraced literally the same marketing style just bc it’s been repackaged in the barbieheimer iteration. idk. i get it, but that’s another tangent. <br><br>anyway you didn’t ask for a pseudo rant on capitalist realism i’m sorry it was literally a yes or no question. no, i have not seen barbie, but i’ll be so down to watch it. mostly i’m just relieved barbie + oppenheimer seem to have delivered for a lot of people. i was legitimately worried the movie event of the summer might end anticlimactically.</div>

 <div class=reply>there’s this post on tumblr that’s like. do you ever just get asked for your favourite things and feel like an alien pretending to be a human being. that’s how i feel whenever i get asked to list my favourite anything, so i’m just gonna projectile vomit a bunch of films i love, if that’s okay: la notte, minding the gap, umbrellas of cherbourg, bringing up baby, roman holiday, the talented mr. ripley, kramer vs. kramer, say anything, 5cm per second, ferris bueller’s day off, the handmaiden, whisper of the heart, us and them, sherlock jr, lady bird, last year in marienbad, aftersun, paper moon, 20th century women, shiva baby, the dreams anthology by kurosawa. god. a bunch of others, most possibly.<br><br>a good many of the songs in this playlist count as all-time favs: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7j1a4n1LrOyhfMPxjCJDQn?si=221c593451a848fc and this one as well: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7mmg8IkbwLWp8qj6GyPch2?si=3cd114279e53464f. but some standalone mainstream favs are heaven knows i’m miserable now, lover you should’ve come over, taro by alt-j, white ferrari by frank ocean, a case of you by joni mitchell, youth by daughter, wild heart by the bleachers, love lust luck by schoolgirl byebye, drown by boy in space, j’ai demandé à la lune by ghostly kisses. a few musicians whose entire oeuvre i love also include alvvays, galileo galilei, for tracy hyde, meenoi, mitski, the national, hoppipola. uh. my fav composer is probably szymanowski bc i like anything that sounds like him. i like chopin and poulenc in moderation as well. i like a whole bunch of ost by akira kosemura, ryuichi sakamoto, hiroyuki sawano.<br><br>this is a horribly malnourished list i’m sorry i’m genuinely awful at narrowing things down on the spot ☹️</div>

 <div class=reply>interesting! if we’re being honest, someone called me a chronic opinion-haver once and i don’t... think... they were wrong? there is likely very little i can’t talk about for ages. maybe not necessarily Well but. you know. if you put me on jimmy fallon’s wheel of opinions segment, i might do fairly okay. maybe. <br><br>BUT a mutual pointed out the other day that the first base of knowing me is how much i love penguins (a different tangent altogether, but honestly i have no reason for loving them except that i do), and second base is knowing how passionate i can get about… chairs? though really i guess it’s more that i love timeless, function-and-form, non-digital technology/engineering. like mechanical keyboards, swiss knives, violins, headphones, analog wristwatches, the bialetti moka cup. you get the idea. i’m not a big subscriber of the idea that practicality means a utilitarian aesthetic, or that looking good means letting feeling good take the backseat if it came down to it. i think it’s a failure on the inventor’s part if beauty compromises function and/or vice versa. whether that’s related to fashion/styling or furniture or tech — i’m pretty set on resenting the contemporary world’s tendency to favour mass manufactured, ease-of-access production over things/brands that take the time to streamline form and function. idk. that’s a whole rant that includes many things from shein to the absence of personal style in a culture of everything being billed as an aesthetic. so it’s just very comforting for me to experience timeless things that look good and feel good. like some herman miller chairs, or owlabs keyboards. i love things that feel like investments and know how to justify their cost, though i also just love anything that takes careful structuring/engineering/handiwork with people in mind. <br><br>with all this said, maybe soft cities — cities designed for walkability and therefore for people-first safety/health/access — are the culmination of all there is to rant about in those things i listed. david sim has a great book on it, though, so i’ll probably just be parroting what he said if i rant about it now. but yeah. at the end of the day, i just like people-first design. that’s my answer. i can talk about people-first design for ages.</div>

 <div class=reply>every day i resist the urge to. Every Single Day. i have a whole lineup of rnbc wips that i keep writing a little bit for here and there. they are So tempting. there is still so much to unpack, which is insane considering how many words i’ve spent inside rin’s mind. plus the official merch team gave us vampire bachira and it’s soooo perfect considering his themes and i need badly to write it — but i can’t. i shouldn’t. i don’t know. <br><br>thank you for asking and being interested ahhh i can’t promise anything but i will say that if the day comes that i do, it won’t be surprising at all. the wips write themselves. the vampire fic is already complete in my mind. it’s There. i’ve written scenes, just not the wider story. i know i’m Busy busy bc i haven’t sat down and caved in.</div>

 <div class=reply>that Thing Deep Inside You is not wrong 😭<br><br>i wouldn’t say i’m a big aa enjoyer Now, but the original trilogy is one of the few game series i’ve played the whole way through, which counts for a lot. i bought the remastered version when i first got my switch, and i do want to replay it now that i’m older and can evaluate it better, but between a few other games i've been playing, i just haven’t had the time/desire to revisit it since i already played all three games. but no you’re not wrong at all omg</div>

 <div class=reply>this is a tricky question! blue lock argues that if someone attempts something easier than is proportionate to their skill level, they will feel bored, but if they challenge something Above their skill level, they will become anxious. i think having “no motivation” comes down to either of these, too. when you do want to write but can’t, i’d say there’s a chance that the problem is simply that you can’t find momentum with writing. you force the words out but you get a sentence or two out and find that that’s it, you don’t have more. it’s hard if finding words feels like pulling teeth, which is usually why i find momentum crucial in writing. i’d even go as far as to say that once you unlock the ins and outs of how you personally generate momentum as a writer, you also unlock your process. blue lock would also call this the necessity of being able to enter flow state at will, which i’m a huge proponent of. not every writer has the capacity to write a novel in two weeks, sure, but nearly every writer knows what it feels like to have momentum and clarity in writing bc we also all know one time we had it and one time we didn’t.<br><br>i can’t diagnose your exact situation with zero particulars, but i feel pretty comfortable saying it’s never some baseless, divinely awarded thing, a lack of “motivation” to write. it always has a reason, whether it’s emotional by way of fear/uncertainty or mental by way of too many distractions. something has to be causing that block, whether or not you’re conscious of it. is it bc you’re trying to write something you’re not capable of producing Yet? is the last thing you read fresh in your mind, and you have a subconscious desire to replicate the idea in your head? or are you trying to write something beneath your skill level, and find yourself unable to be excited about the same old boring thing? are you trying to rework something you’d written before and therefore don’t know where to start? <br><br>maybe you don’t know what you want to write, or maybe you’re not being realistic, or maybe you’re not challenging yourself enough by trying something you haven’t before. it could be anything, i can’t speak for you, but lack of motivation to write is not impossible to tackle. the idea is to give yourself actionable tasks to do; unless you know for sure you’re the type of writer who can open a doc and get started with nothing at all, then you have to give your brain specific instructions/prompts until you get to a point where you can just weave in and out of flow. sometimes it helps to tackle art like you would an athletic exercise. don’t attempt something you don’t have the stamina or running speed for, bc that’s the fastest way to your body associating impossibility with the thing. but if you pay attention to what it needs — whether it’s running 100m before you can attempt a lap, or needing to stretch first by doing whatever counts as a warm up — i think it might help you at least diagnose a solution. if this makes sense.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! i've been debating over sending this message for a while because im much more used to reading your cc for comfort than seeking a conversation, of sorts. have you seen any manhua or donghua and do you have favorites? I wanted to ask as someone who got into link click (shiguang dailiren) and freshly reminded of how much I appreciate chinese media's writing - whose best works often have intricately written world building as well as a storyline that puts human conflicts, values and moral ideals as top focus. i suppose i'm curious about your lense of donghua/manhua, as our tastes in animanga seem to overlap lots. other than that i hope your progress in original writing has been self satisfactory and have a good daynoonnight!</div>

 <div class=reply>whoa hello i’m so glad a) that you’re able to find comfort in my ccs but also b) that you felt comfortable reaching out !! i take small eternities to reply and it’s horrible, but i truly am grateful to hear from people, so thank you for dropping by 🤍<br><br>that said, i actually haven’t watched any other donghua except for link click, i think. not even tgcf or mdzs. mostly bc i don’t venture much even in anime beyond adaptations of series i already know i like. i know i’ve tried a few titles, but none of that have clicked past the first episode, so i can hardly offer recs. but i totally agree with the strengths of chinese media that you outlined! i’d even argue that this is especially true not just of donghua/manhua but specifically of chinese sci-fi/speculative fiction. you see glimpses of it in link click’s humanistic approach to what would usually be billed as an action-packed urban fantasy/magical realism story in a more saturated genre like anime, but you see variations of the same exploration in work by the three sci fi generals (i think the definition of who these three are usually changes with the times, but for my purposes, i mean liu cixin, han song and wang jinkang.)<br><br>i know it’s not quite donghua and/or manhua — i seriously need to get started on manhua recs from housemates — but i think liu cixin’s the three body problem series is the pinnacle of all the things you mentioned. the tny writer jia tolentino said something once along the lines of how that series makes the futility of the human race and the unknowability of life seem so spiritually exciting and alive, which is not a conundrum you can usually balance so seamlessly in western fiction. i also want to throw in the little mushroom series by shisi, which is a bizarre little light novel (?) sci-fi that i’ve been rationing to finish when i know i’ll need restoration of faith in reading and writing. again, none of these are donghua/manhua, i apologize, but these were genuinely the first to come to mind when i read the part of your cc outlining the unique strengths of chinese media. i will keep an eye out otherwise!</div>

 <div class=reply>HMM i’m more a thick and hefty book person myself so i don’t really know a ton of titles, let alone ones more niche/hard to find, but the first books to come to mind were: cold enough for snow by jessica au, the pachinko parlour + a winter in sokcho by elisa shua dusapin, ms. ice sandwich by mieko kawakami, mr. salary by sally rooney, the white book by han kang, dept. of speculation by jenny offill, bluets by maggie nelson, asleep by banana yoshimoto, love speech by sherry huang, females by andrea long chu, and i guess i can throw in franny and zooey by j.d. salinger and after dark by haruki murakami but that’s mostly bc those are the only short books in my list of candidates for favourite novels of all time 🤔❣️<br><br>for poetry books/collections, crush by richard siken is an obvious one, but also prelude to bruise by saeed jones, soft science by franny choi, anybody by ari banias, vintage sadness by hanif abdurraqib, bright dead things by ada limón, and bc she doesn’t have any collections out yet as far as i know, for now just anything by elisa gonzalez: https://www.elisamariegonzalez.com/publications</div>

 <div class=reply>oh! if you only mean the one chapter i posted before, it’s been here for a while now: https://sleeptowns.tumblr.com/post/709266543548252160/a-year-or-so-of-fics-in-retrospect<br><br>(just scroll down the section for that fic and click on the title — it should open to a pdf! the readers i’ve heard from told me you can download the pdf, but if you run into any problems with the link at all, i’m happy to send the pdf over myself. otherwise, the fic has been deleted completely off ao3. i don’t private/orphan, unfortunately. so it’s totally gone. it was just cleaner and easier that way.) <br><br>if you meant to ask whether i’ll ever repost and/or continue... i think it’s highly unlikely 😢 the jjk fics/readers tend to be a world on their own, and i do often think the only thing that makes them still mine is having the technical cityboys label at the top. flls is flls, you know? it’s like what sofia is to clairo and what heather is to conan gray. the song people know from tik tok and the reason they attended the concert even if they might not know the rest of that singer’s discography. i remain endlessly grateful for it — and thank you, sincerely, for being one of the jjk readers and holding onto even this one — but if i deliberately deleted/abandoned a thing, then it will very likely stay deleted and/or abandoned. it’s still nice to think about what that world could have been, though, definitely.</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha! sorry if this is a weird question but do you get any hate at all? like, both for you as a person and for your craft. if so, how do you deal with it? i’m looking for tips bc i’m a really sensitive person and hate or harsh criticism really gets to me :(</div>

 <div class=reply>not weird at all !! but to me, hate and criticism are antonyms. hate is unproductive, nonsensical, therefore pathetic. i’ve gotten people being incredibly stupid about inane details, like the way i title fics, or my vocabulary, why i tweet diary entries. and i mean. all of them are useless, you know? it makes no difference to the fact that this is how i am. i tweet this or that bc that’s how twitter works, my titles are from songs that other people wrote, my vocab is like this bc it is. i’m a shrug and delete person, though ofc i do get petty sometimes, too. i poke fun at them with my friends. but i don’t internalize feelings that hate give me bc they haven’t earned that from me.<br><br>criticism is more nuanced. i’m lucky never to have received harsh criticism on my writing, but when i do get feedback at work, i try to give it as much of me as possible without taking it personally. then again, i’m pretty selective about who gets to talk down to me. if they have terrible writing, or they’re not a respectable person, then why would i be the least bit fazed by what they think of my work? someone can tell me i suck and get a reaction only if they can provide productive reasons. if someone’s like “i don’t like your titles” it’s like… alright. why would it matter to anyone if one random unknown doesn’t approve of their preferences? it changes nothing in mattering. until i know i love and respect someone’s tastes, why would their input make a dent on how i view myself? i know i can be dismissive about illogical things, but that also includes unconstructive and/or inactionable criticism. if it will help me get better at something, sure, but if it’s an empty opinion, then dwelling on it is time and thought wasted, even more if it won’t change what i want to do or have already done.<br><br>i think it’s normal to have a reaction to criticism, though! i’m sure harshness is awful to experience, and petty hate may be more difficult to process Exactly bc it’s nonsensical. my view is that criticism has to be earned just as much as my respect for someone does. if they have done nothing to show me why their criticism would matter — then it doesn’t. simple as that. there is so much that needs my attention and they will only take up unnecessary space. that’s what you don’t want. in any case, it’s true that some people need to be better at phrasing their feedback, no matter how useful. but criticism is never about you. ever. it’s about them, or it’s about the thing they’re criticizing. that’s all. it’s never attached to you. unless you attach it to yourself. i don’t really know how to tell you to… not. bc i don’t understand. i know i don’t. i know this is me fumbling through not understanding. but. i think criticism is best evaluated in a place separate from all the rest that defines you. Then you can choose to integrate it. don’t let the initial reaction to Being Criticized decide how you feel about the criticism itself. i think. but i know that’s easy for me to preach.</div>

 <div class=reply>i haven’t read it in english at all yet omg how are you liking it !! i feel like the art style has changed a bit and i’m not really feeling it…? it’s lost some of the gentleness/soft realism that i associate with upi’s art, and the general atmosphere has shifted towards a direction i’m not sure i’m vibing with entirely. maybe. remains to be seen, though, and i wonder if i’ll feel differently about some of the plot details once i’ve read the context in translation. <br><br>that said, this doesn’t change how much i missed them during the hiatus :( i appreciate the continued back-and-forth between woowon’s difficulty receiving gifts and seo an’s inability to Not show his love through material proof, and how they’re genuinely meeting each other halfway. i remember being like, “has someone told seo an about the swimming? will someone Please tell seo an about swimming?” then he pulls the pool thing and i was like man i’m sorry for doubting the most efficient lead in the history of romance media 😭 kdrama chaebols have nothing on kang seo an. i’m so serious. it’s ridiculous how efficient he is. he has a plan in place at all times — and all while balancing his panic disorder and social anxiety, too. you will never catch this man without a strategy. it’s amazing. i’m so happy he got the [beep beep beep] he has deserved all series so far. no one has needed it in the upi universe like he has. <br><br>i also have a lot to say about seo an’s relationship with his two siblings — but again. we’ll see. i have yet to pick up since they ran to the hospital but i definitely will soon.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh god… i don’t really keep track of all articles i’ve read, i’m afraid… i’d have to catalogue A LOT per day if i kept track of everything i read, i think. i’m remarkably lazy. but i remember there was… a really cool article on the eye as a weapon in baldwin’s if beale street could talk. another one on buster keaton as a “bewildered equilibrist”? another one (a few, actually, unless it’s all one big article i’m remembering) that was in defense of goneril and regan from king lear. another on horace and virgilian mimesis. though none of these are necessarily favourites. <br><br>i also don’t know if i got these from jstor but some recent pdfs i still haven’t cleaned up off my laptop after reading are:<br><br>✧ “The Death of Dissent and the Decline of Dissin’: A Diachronic Study of Race, Gender, and Genre in Mainstream American Rap” by John P. Racine<br><br>✧ “You bet she can f*ck” Trends in Female AI Narratives within Mainstream Cinema: Ex Machina and Her” by Sennah Yee<br><br>✧ “Intimacy Beyond Sex: Korean Television Dramas, Nonsexual Masculinities, and Transnational Erotic Desires” by Min Joo Lee<br><br>✧ “Whose Hand Was I Holding?” Familial and Sexual Politics in Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House by Tricia Lootens<br><br>again, i wouldn’t say these are my Favourites favourites, but i do think they’re cool nonetheless !! i’m sorry i couldn’t give more definite recs :(</div>

 <div class=reply>the film? i remember looking forward to it bc i was struck by timothee chalamet in his small interstellar role and that was the only project he had coming up at the time, so i read the book and was just. let down. but a part of me still looked forward to the movie. <br><br>but the age gap debacle aside (though not to devalue it, i just think it’s a no shit moment, considering the general atmosphere and themes andré aciman loves), i guess i just didn’t see the things people liked about the film. i found it Barely beautiful; it’s only the setting that saves its “cinematography.” the music is disjointed, and often it felt like they just wanted to cram another entry in from their list of curated pieces. there was absolutely no chemistry between elio and oliver, even if that’s what you wanted to use to argue For the age gap. people praise the acting — but where? the formulaic nose flare and wobbly expression? set jaw and empty stare? and that acclaimed monologue with michael stuhlbarg? why…? what’s so good about it? it did push me to live in italy for a bit, but i found the italy episode of normal people more moving with that in mind.<br><br>i know all of these details are pieces people felt for but the whole thing just felt like hypercalculated artifice. even the final scene. especially some of the “emotional” scenes and monologues. idk. maybe i’m just too heartless for some films. but i don’t like having to bring my tenderness to a story. i want to be given it or invited to meet the story halfway in producing it. cmbyn just felt cold and emotionless. friends were crying after and i was just stunned. felt like one of those moments where i understand why i’ve been called a particularly lifelike robot. i wanted to love it and feel for the film, and i do very much enjoy the two songs sufjan lent to it. but idk. i couldn’t produce any human emotions for it at all.</div>

 <div class=reply>ofc !! carrie and lowell was my introduction to him, though, so i was pretty late to jumping on that wagon, and still truthfully don’t know his Entire discography super well. one of my first… partners? i guess? if that’s even what it was? one of the people i was seeing in the last years of my teens. they were a big fan, so i mostly got to know his music through standalone songs that were sent to me. the songs i do know are strong all-time favourites though, even if they’re on the basic/mainstream end! if i had to pick a fav album, maybe either illinois or carrie or lowell?</div>

 <div class=reply>allowing myself some brief honesty here to say that there’s this line in the last section of trust by hernan diaz where a character’s diary entry simply reads “nuit sans fin.” that’s how summer has been, to spare you the finer details. it’s been a night without end. though maybe that’s not fair bc i like the nighttime. it’s been a jour sans fin, then. it’s been endless days upon endless days. a long sunday afternoon, with the melancholy compounded on top of each layer it builds up the further we get into the season. which is very dramatic but i am just not at all a summer person and i never shut up about it. the world feels meaner. stickier. clinging to skin that doesn’t want to feel anything. i don’t want to be outside. i don’t want to exist. the thoughts are getting bad again. but this happens every year. it’s like clockwork. there’s a quote somewhere that describes summer as a slow plague, and that’s really it. winter is a brief reprieve from the illness, but summer always returns to where i don’t want to be. <br><br>all this to say that i can’t wait for summer to be over. that’s all. it’s more accepting than it might sound, i promise.</div>

 <div class=reply>i do, actually! i really appreciate you asking, but as long as there’s no distribution and/or financial exchange/profit happening, since it’s not my work to be allowing distribution for, then that’s absolutely fine. More than fine. i have a pdf file i send people who ask, which has the formatting of the print copies my friends made for me, and if you’re comfortable dm-ing me, i can send you a dropbox link — but if not, also totally fine! whatever works best for you. i’m honoured you’d want a physical, personal copy of flls. thank you so much for holding one of my stories close to heart like this. it means a lot.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh !! whoa !! thank you ?? i don’t think i’ve thought much about how i do my graphics. mostly they seem to benefit from being… low effort? i make them rather minimal, just the title and my pseud and/or a short one-line summary. i also like to use the same photo for both parts (though this is more out of laziness about finding a photo), which ensures clean continuity. so i’d say just make sure the colours complement each other, and that our basic internal rules of graphic design apply as far as typeset, colour pairings and symmetry go. i’m not very creative/imaginative with my graphics, to be fair. i’ve kind of given up on posting them since hairpin turns. so really, i’m glad someone finds them cute, and i’m sorry i don’t have more substantial tips to give 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>here’s my longer review, if you’d like to read it! https://literal.club/regressor/book/singshong-omniscient-readers-viewpoint-cx07w<br><br>the general gist is that i thought it was okay! like a solid 2.5 to 3 out of 5. a passing grade, at least. i don’t not feel for it. some days, it hits me hard. but i’m also not at a level with it where i think: oh yeah, that was Good. you know? i used to think hmm i wonder if i would have liked it more if i read it before su*cide hunter (time to yet again link this post https://bidokja.tumblr.com/post/665008165291802625/i-remember-ages-ago-you-told-me-sssrh-was-better and this post https://bidokja.tumblr.com/post/659260435172818944/what-does-sssrh-stand-for) but no i think, evaluated by itself, i would still feel the same way i do now. the writing struck me as shoddy and haphazard, and not just bc of the translation. but i’m just reiterating what i said in the review. so. if you’d like more detail, i promise it’s not as lengthy as my other reviews 😞<br><br>again, i do feel tenderness for orv, but a part of me feels like reading it was time and energy i could have better dedicated somewhere else. it’s an odd middle ground. i’m glad i understand the fandom ins and out now. but that’s never reason enough.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello! fic/lit recs for… what? as a whole? bc i don’t have any. i’m never quite sure how to approach giving recs if the question is just "hey. recommend me something." something what? though to be fair this isn’t a criticism of you! just that there’s no such thing as universal recs. what i like aren’t necessarily recs i’ll just throw out. <br><br>also, writing tips for what? fiction? nonfiction? fic? my honest to god only tip… is to just do it. i know that sounds incredibly blasé but i feel like a lot of writers who don’t yet know how they work think exploration is a piece of The Process and The Craft that’s separate from the writing — which i don’t think is true. do you really know that you work best relying on one of those really big writer templates for all your ocs or did you just see other writers working with those and are forcing yourself into that work process? writing can’t be given to you, is the thing. <br><br>there Are some tenets i like to parrot, like how 1) if you’re new to writing, there’s no shame in imitating. not plagiarizing, but imitating. it can feel taboo to acknowledge that most writers start with imitation, but i say it’s good to imitate though mostly bc 2) being a good writer can depend a great deal on being a good editor. there’s nothing more valuable in writing (to me) than being your own first editor. that said, when we’re unhappy with the work we produce, a lot of the time that’s bc we have an intrinsic understanding of what’s good, and we’re just not meeting that. and that traps people into spirals of oh, i Have to emulate this to get good. but 3) you can always revise. but you won’t know how to revise well if you don’t know yet what makes something good. language is like music. not storytelling, but the words themselves. it’s tricky to do it well if you’re tone deaf, or at least if you don’t know what note is what. <br><br>all that said, though, 4) the rules suck. sure, you have to master language to a degree before you can throw it all out the window, but in the end, the rules just suck. the typical structures, tropes, all of that. every rule has as much a caveat as it does truth. like adverbs, for instance. they tell you not to use them, and it’s true, bc it’s horrendous when ill-used, but have you ever seen a well-placed adverb? mwah. but again, how will you know what makes a well-placed adverb if you can’t single out a badly-placed one? <br><br>in the end, the irony of all this is that i don’t know much about writing and should not be using so many Have Tos and Needs in this reply when even i know they don’t matter. i only know what works for me, and my writing is the way it is bc i’ve never been taught or advised to do it a certain way. so if i have any real tips, it’s only to absorb, apply, revise, rinse, repeat. again and again. then abandon all of it. i know it might not be helpful at all, but these are genuinely all i’ve got 😢</div>

 <div class=reply>oh god i feel so bad bc this is such a sweet message and i truly am touched, but also i’m not done being blunt, so let me continue my thought in the last reply —<br><br>where was i. no, there’s no way to control how you’re perceived. there is no correct perception, not even yours of your own self. but our end of an interaction, we can control, and that’s what makes words worth it. you seem to be projecting a lot of self-centric (not narcissistic, but centred around your literal self) assumptions about the world but making no effort to meet it halfway, or to try harder for it to understand you. but even that is an assumption i’m making about you. it might be fair, or it might not be. or maybe you’ve tried and been burnt. i understand. but is there a chance… the divide is there Because you don’t want to cross it? or maybe you don’t like that it takes effort to cross it, and don’t like knowing that even when you’ve tried your best, other people still have their own agency and perception of you beyond your maneuvering. maybe you have projected smth true for another thing to your wider worldview. Maybe. it sounds like you want to be witnessed in being yourself without the vulnerability or equivalent exchange that comes with, bc even running away for you is branded as “social exile” instead of “freedom.” there are a lot of self-concepts here that you’ll find are reflective not of a lack of connection with the world, but a lack of desire to change that except to grieve the fact that it’s not easy. which, nonetheless, is fair.<br><br>i know i’m being too sharp. and again, i could very well be making unfair assumptions you. i’m not going to be like, how dare you position me as wrong? how dare my perception of this or that NOT be correct? i think there are certain personalities, perhaps such as yours, that find subjectivity to be the objective way the world is… but often that’s just not true. you’re still someone who has their own agency, and there are too many factors that go into every single minute of your life for you to make final statements. or at least that’s what i think. writing isn’t in the initial outpouring from mind to page/voice. it’s in the revisions you make after. it’s in how present you are in each word you’re saying. if you open your mouth already frustrated at how lacking you think you Know it will be (but you don’t know this, not for a fact, i promise), have you not already denied yourself the possibility of otherwise? <br><br>i don’t know. thank you so much for being so kind in your words here, and i know i’m highlighting the very thing you’re frustrated about by targeting your choice of words. but the inbox is right there, and you are always free to add more, amend the things you said, correct me if i’m wrong until we get it right. and that’s also true of life. even if it might be difficult to be willing to do. but i have been indelicate enough, and i promise i didn’t mean to be cruel. i’m squeezing your hand over this cup of tea gone cold.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha&lt;3 <br>i’m not too sure what to do with this so i hope it’s alright to come to you with— i feel like you’d understand where i’m coming from. <br>lately things have been Trying but that’s what twenties are, i know this, but im about to turn 22 in late july and it’s really catching up to me how i have to Make my own presence, you know? like. i can’t hide anymore. idk. and im realizing that my mind to mouth connection is irreparable— there’s a million things going on in my head, but not even a quarter of it translates verbally, and whatever fraction that does come out of my mouth makes me sound like such a airhead incapable of anything beyond surface level. it’s entirely sickening (😭) and also a bit unnerving… because there’s such glaring divide between the internal and external self i’m experiencing. at the same time, there are plenty of moments where i’m so, very easily read— and i guess i’m asking how one should go about being perceived. this is so silly i know but i honestly don’t know how to correctly be perceived, especially after losing my relationship with writing, and consequently, words. it’s gotten so bad to the point where i’m considering to be completely non-verbal and to communicate through notes and very basic asl. half of me wants so badly to go through with it; half of me recognizes only a deeply wounded person would want a social exile. <br>i don’t know— ultimately the world will not change whether i speak nonstop for the rest or my life or spend it in complete silence. i guess my biggest fear is spend all my life running away in hopes of safety to only sabotage any chances of it while doing so.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello. okay. this will not be my gentlest reply of the night, but please know i mean all of it with sincere eartnessness. if you said all of this to me in person, i would have sat you down and made you some tea not only as a stilted method of comforting but bc i’m about to take up an hour minimum of your time just poking at some of the language you use here. there are a lot of ultimatums, to start: i “can’t” hide anymore “bc i’m 22.” to be “correctly” perceived. “only” a “deeply wounded” person would want a “social exile.” my mind to mouth connection is “irreparable.” see what i mean? where are these finalities coming from? bc none of these are to me universally the way things are. you’re throwing a lot of conclusions at yourself and i don’t know where to even find the first argument / evidence supporting it. ofc i don’t know everything about you and i can only tell that you Have been trying, but there are a lot of hurtful things you’re tossing out here, not just to people to whom these big assumptions apply but also, most importantly, to yourself. <br><br>while we’re at it, let’s examine the verbs you use. “realizing” implies that what you’re seeing is fact and not simply one possible interpretation of where your thoughts differ from what you say. what does it mean to “hide”? to be “perceived”? to “sabotage” chances at life… forever? i’m not making the connections, personally. so let me gently say that none of these compute bc they aren’t concepts that exist, let alone ones that are set in stone. why are you an exile if you start finding different ways to communicate? what about the people who Do communicate differently? are they deeply wounded for something they were born having to accommodate? since i personally choose solitude, and since i prefer to write more than i do to speak, is that a consequence of me being deeply wounded and not simply a choice i make to accommodate my own comfort and ensure i communicate the way that serves me and the people around my best? <br><br>i’m sorry to play the “what about…” card, but again. so many ultimatums. are the words you find lacking incapable of being revised? rewritten? it doesn’t sound like words failed you, it sounds like you gave up on them bc they weren’t born the way you wanted them to be. i’m sorry if that’s not fair to say. but this is my perspective on it. it also seems like you feel as if other people don’t experience the same divide you do (or maybe it is that you believe they don’t have as much internally to convey externally.) what comes out of our mouths IS only ever a fraction of what we think. there’s no way to change that. but when you find something less than what you want it to be, you don’t compensate by doing even less. you try more. you add more words. which i am running out of space for so i’m so glad you sent other cc hold on i’m not done 🏃</div>

 <div class=reply>yes !! it’s funny, i actually had to do a hot ones type interview once for a local election, and i was just so sad at how un-spicy it was that it kind of rewired my relationship with the show even though theirs must be much, much better. but also. i find that sean evans is one of those hit or miss interviewers that get away with being hit or miss bc he has a team that digs out more “obscure” questions, but if you really examine some (not all) of the questions he asks beyond that initial “whoa how did you know that?” sometimes he’s not really asking… anything? he asks really broad questions that are more reminiscent of high school reporters than, say, other new talk show hosts like hasan minhaj who know how to open AND pursue a line of thinking and keep his foot on it. sean is also often unable to follow up beyond the initial research-informed question, and for the depth of the info he has on hand, he defaults to the most uninteresting / blatant segues. it’s infuriating to me sometimes. so it tends to be more satisfying when the other person takes charge of the interview and gives great answers even based on the worst leading questions. matt damon was an unexpectedly great recent guest with that in mind, and i love that he treated sean’s questions with the same decorum and overly serious answers that he would any other part of the press junket. i loved his little answer on the materialism (?) aspect of the film industry, bc he had a unique perspective as someone who’s been on set for so long and in so many roles. jacob elordi was also surprisingly charming in his episode; i think this is the only interview i’ve seen of his where i was like, oh, i see why people find him attractive. he Can be quite charismatic. elizabeth olsen’s energy was also great, though i think she’s just a fun person to encounter doing press in any way. <br><br>all that aside, my fav episode is easily padma lakshmi’s always always always i loved her poise, i was charmed by how she genuinely evaluated the flavours of the hot sauce, and also just — it’s interesting to have a food personality that isn’t gordon ramsay or guy fieri, bc weirdly, hers felt the most informed by love for food when she isn’t even technically a chef. she came across as one of those people for whom food seems to represent its own culture (and i liked her docuseries taste the nation, so at least it wasn’t just a one-off for this particular interview) and it was just a breath of fresh air to have her on the show. it also felt like sean was a tiny bit more flustered and eager to please in this episode, and in that more willing to react and do a back-and-forth. so. definitely an episode that hasn’t been replicated since.</div>

 <div class=reply>i am so late to replying to this that the season has long started airing — but i Have been tuning in and will continue to do so! i had a meltdown and ensuing crisis after the first ep bc the opening got me emotional (as does the colour of the heart you chose), and i did very much enjoy some of the direction in that ep, but everything after has just been. eh. and has restored my indifference to jjk. though i Am surprised at how much renewed tenderness i have been feeling for gojo, especially when i have very sparse recollection of the technical parts of the hidden inventory arc now 😞<br><br>the jjk anime has always been a rare kind of series in that the adaptation is (to me) undeniably better than the source. s1 at least had an understanding of story beats and plotting that i felt akutami didn’t consistently have, whether that’s in the relationship between characters or in the blocking of fight scenes in motion. it’s very palpably missing in mappa’s other recent work, though, including some bits of jjk s2 so far, so it could very well be that stars simply aligned the first time and we’ll never again see the magic of that reproduced. just bc i hate the manga and its author doesn’t mean i don’t objectively stand by the strengths of the anime’s first season. it’s easily the best new gen shounen adaptation for me so far, and i say that as a mp100 enthusiast. csm and jigokuraku — oh, don’t get me started. but to be fair, you didn’t even get me started on my thoughts on jjk. i’m ranting now. i’m sorry. omg.</div>

 <div class=reply>i named a few things here https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1321747556 but a few days after that i realized i didn’t mention inception! how could i have missed that! it’s The ultimate media guilty pleasure for me… so many plot holes, so many things that didn’t have to be as it was, so many gripes i can have and dwell on, but it’s just unequivocally my main comfort watch aside from ferris bueller’s day off, which is objectively just great if you ask me. i think i talked about inception only once but: https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1555053884061749248<br><br>hmm... objectively bad… i mean. i like a lot of things questionable in quality in a wider context, but idk if current me is truly capable of Love-love for something that’s objectively written badly. i think nowadays when i love something i can always advocate for its good-ness somehow. whether the good-ness IS how wonky it is. but younger me was a different story, and i do try to honour the stuff that meant something to them as much as i can. i was a kpop fan throughout the 2nd and 3rd generations and genuinely found all the music from that era enjoyable even if i might criticize them now. more recently, i did enjoy the manhwa red candy, which — don’t even me get me started on how indulgent and over-the-top it is. ridiculous. yet sometimes bigger than the whole sky comes on shuffle and i’m hit by all my feelings for it. if i had to fantasize about adapting any piece of media into a full-fledged show, it would be this one. it’s like a really chaotic and melodramatic kdrama. which leads me to also virtually any tv adaptation of the hana yori dango story, minus maybe boys over flowers, which i didn’t even bother to watch. i still love the tv show with matsujun and inoue mao, but the original meteor garden is one of the earliest pieces of media i’ve ever consumed, alongside stairway to heaven, autumn in my heart, love story in harvard, full house, etc. i wasn’t allowed to watch tv or play with friends when i was a kid, so these really campy kdramas were my main exposure to media culture through a non-family member before i started elementary school. i still hold a soft spot for that genre now, questionable and badly written as they all must have been. <br><br>in music, though, i have no discerning taste whatsoever. this week, i’ve been listening as much to the zom 100 opening as i have been looping sarah tuan’s set in the 18th chopin competition. so i can’t make a judgment about what’s objectively bad. send me whale sounds and i will give it a listen. that’s why i find it good to consume things outside of my usual purview, bc music and paintings… what do i know about what makes one objectively good or bad? i just know how it makes me feel, and that’s all the basis i need for whether i like it or not. it’s not like books or film, where i can critique the storytelling comfortably. it’s nice to be quality-blind to things, but anyway. that’s a whole other tangent 😓</div>

 <div class=question>im really fascinated by the idea you mentioned in one of your tweets of waking up in a foreign body and the terror that would accompany that. i was wondering if you had any more thoughts or have read anything in that vein of thought. tysm! i admire your mind so much</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, you are very kind !! and isn’t it fascinating !! it’s something i’ve been preoccupied with in recent writing projects. this thing i’m working on has it, but before that, there was this character in the series blue lock who has a “monster” inside him — kinda like this creature who embodies his ideal of the soccer player he wants to be. and this character’s arc is mostly about realizing there’s no monster, there’s never been a monster that wasn’t him, that he can’t keep playing as if his body isn’t his. he has to be accountable to his own life, to his own love for soccer. and when i was writing a fic for bllk, i wanted to experiment with the idea of how… what if you lose your memories? what if you come into consciousness in this life that doesn’t feel like it’s yours bc you don’t even remember it? what does it mean to be haunted by memories that aren’t there? what if you had to be Told what you used to love? what if the things that feel like instinct/intuition to your body just feels like someone else’s instincts and intuition, bc are you even the self you used to be? <br><br>and now, at the new job i just started, i’ve been working with this memoir called when my ghost sings — it’s not out until fall but you can read the synopsis here and see why i bring it up: https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/W/When-My-Ghost-Sings<br><br>(of course waking up in a foreign body is also a sensation that echoes how it feels to experience certain mental health situations. it’s a phenomenon you’ll find very often in nonfiction about dissociation, depression, DID, schizophrenia — which aren’t really what i meant in my tweets.) <br><br>i Have been thinking recently that so many possession stories i’ve read seem to parallel pieces similar to scenarios explained by mental health 🤔 come closer by sara gran is the first title to come to mind, but i’m also thinking of dark places by gillian flynn, which is less about the foreignness of the body and more about whether you truly perfectly remember something that all your life you thought you knew well. who gets to tell you otherwise? the manga hikaru ga shinda natsu also offers some interesting points about what constitutes a self when the original owner of the body has been compromised, though ultimately it has little to do with the complexity of it so much as it just. is there. more philosophical than eerie imo. <br><br>this got very long and rambly but tl;dr: when my ghost sings, come closer, and dark places have elements of something a little similar. otherwise, the thought mostly came from my current writing fixations, so i admit that as of yet i’m not super well-versed on it beyond like. philosophy about consciousness. oh, but on that note (tangentially related), i do recommend the most recent episodes of the podcast philosophize this! stephen west practically raised me but ep 179 onwards has been covering consciousness specifically, and as always, he’s amazing at survey introductions to particular schools of thought.</div>

 <div class=question>oh please don't apologize for answering thoroughly! you are so sweet. this is exactly the type of response i was hoping for! to be really honest with you, i'm a year away from graduating with a double major in comparative literature &amp; psychology and i feel quite lost. i want to get a masters in psych for sure, both because i am passionate and because that would, like you said, open doors for better oppurtunities for me to financially support myself. i've relied on scholarships my whole life to get here, and now that the end is so near, i've found i'm not sure what i want to do, which area i want to specialize in, what kind of career i want to pursue... it's all so so overwhelming. and the fact that you got to work in many different fields regardless of your degree and were able to support yourself (because i feel like becoming homeless is my biggest worry as of now...) is very inspiring! so thank you so much. if you have any advice for someone like me, i'm always open to your kindness.</div>

 <div class=reply>i think it’s totally normal to feel lost! i like to think of it this way: there’s something about not knowing what to choose that means, technically, anything is possible. if a choice was clear, for instance, if you really only had one choice to the point that it’s so obvious and set in stone, then that means all others doors are closed, you know what i mean? <br><br>you have worked so hard !! you have so much to be proud of !! i think that each day we live that isn’t the one before is us working against all odds, and especially so when you have had to rely on other external factors just to keep the life you have stable. but i do completely empathize with the worry of being homeless… two years ago, around this same time, my debit account was $500 in the negative, my credit cards were all maxed out, i had to take a freelance job paying $300 instead of my usual $1000 bc i just needed money for bills fast. i did acting jobs. i was a barista for a bit. then i got the job at what was once my dream workplace. not to say that dreams coming true are what will make hardships worth it — i think often, suffering is just suffering, and as much as we want it to mean something, that just means we’re playing into the tunnel vision it wants us to have. but that’s exactly it. i think the most we can do in life is to not tunnel vision.<br><br>otherwise, idk how useful advice from me would be since i really just. live day to day. and that’s really all i can offer you. i know it must be overwhelming, but i think that’s also partly bc it sounds like you’re looking at the bigger picture at all times. sometimes, it’s okay to let small actions be small. you don’t have to make every choice in life only after weighing it for whether it will bring you closer to The End Goal. bc then what if you don’t get the end goal? what if you do everything right and your neighbour’s apartment goes up in flames and accidentally brings you along? does it devalue all the work you’ve still put in? i don’t think so. i think rigidity, or the need to be right every step of the way, can make us fragile. so sometimes it can be a good thing to not be immediately sure. what i do know is that there will always be a way somewhere, just that you have to meet it halfway by being as malleable and open-minded as you can be. steady on your values and your selfhood, flexible everywhere else, as i like to say about my fav character in blue period. then again i have my own biases about these things. <br><br>in the end, if you ask me, i think you’re doing more than fine. you’re doing really well, from what i know. trust yourself a bit to figure it out, come what may. you’ve already been doing exactly that, to come this far.</div>

 <div class=reply>📚 richard… they can never make me hate you. they can never turn me against you. all the poets that have been worshipped only in fragments through twt parallels and tumblr web weavings then ripped down from the pedestal bc the more recognizable bits of their poetry have gotten tiring and overused — i might never feel that way about richard siken. his poetry will always hit me hard. his poetry will always remind me what simplicity of language and the rhythm of internal thought can do in the relationship between words and reader, and his style carries a balance i love seeing even beyond poetry. the three newest poems did take a while to simmer in me but now they make me ache. just. so many poems of his i know parts of by heart but even so, they never get old. i love that man’s writing. if i could protect him from people’s over-humanizing of the poet over the poetry, i would. <br><br>💿 i share some thoughts on the record here: https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1321226883 and so far they haven’t changed! <br><br>💼 interesting! i think the rise of tote bags in the fashion industry is more symptomatic than anything of its rise as cultural capital — which i only use in this case to mean the cultural/aesthetic goods we like to be seen with in order to attain some degree of standing out in society (ironically, it functions as a tool to conform/assimulate.) like luxury bags, yes, but also the books we read in public, the trends we adhere to, etc. when we want to be seen as “educated,” what aesthetics do we subscribe to? when we want to be seen as “cool,” what are the pieces we buy to be markers of that cool-ness? <br><br>so with tote bags, i think what we’re seeing is less a fashion-related rise (though ofc it’s adjacent; fashion is prob time’s oldest cultural capital) and more an extension of what we saw happen with book tote bags, for example. here’s an article from my old workplace that covers the general idea: ​​https://thewalrus.ca/tote-bag. but certain totes mean you are a certain type of person. that in turn is related to the rise of the “off-model” look, which in turn is related to how famous celebrities like to eat cheap pizza and hotdogs in their grammy or oscar ceremony formal attire to achieve a relatable visual. <br><br>all this to say that i think it’s a lot of things at once — fashion, our current over-awareness of the aesthetics we subscribe to and how/why, the over-exposure to what other people are using via what items gain traction online — for which totes are the perfect piece. you start advancing something accessible as having inherent value of its own and people start mistaking it for access to individuality. like the boom in popularity of sanrio, miffy, snoopy, sonny angels. or vinyls, uniqlo crescent bags, headphones. each one of these products are tied to the popularity of aesthetics. nothing is immune, and tote bags are one of the earliest examples. which isn’t to say that some people don’t just use totes bc they find them handy, ofc!</div>

 <div class=reply>this is… so, so sweet… and i’ve been thinking about it a lot since i received it, so thank you so much for the sentiment :( i’ll try! i can’t promise anything right now, and fair warning that i’m just. not all that interesting. or at least i don’t Do anything interesting worth taking photos of. my actual personal life is very, very quiet. everything that happens to me are just other people’s lives happening and roping me into it. the me part of the living just doesn’t have that much going on. maybe that’s why i don’t have an instinct at all for taking photos / “documenting” anything (that, plus i think good things are best allowed the freedom of ephemerality if they so wish), but i do definitely want to try! let me chew on this a bit more and see what i can do.</div>

 <div class=reply>a few episodes! maybe half? i needed more go minsi after seeing an interview for marie claire, but it wasn’t streaming on any of the subscription services i had at the time so i just kinda. gave up on streaming through secondhand sites. <br><br>i didn’t hate it by any means, though! setting a love story during the days of the gwangju uprising was interesting, i found the premise and atmosphere charming, and the main couple’s chemistry served. nothing incredibly wrong with it, really, at least from what i watched. it was just. a drama. it’s mostly that tragedy where the tragedy IS the premise/establishing mood is already a pass for me from the outset. so i’m not sure if i’ll pick it up again.</div>

 <div class=reply>the last one i went to must have been before the pandemic omg… my calendar says it was a COIN concert in late 2019, but that wasn’t really out of my own interest. i mostly come along to concerts if someone wants a plus one; it’s always a nice chance to be a curious newbie to smth interesting. otherwise, i’m not much of a concert person. i get irritable and overwhelmed in loud crowds, which is like. what a concert is. i almost got into a fist fight once in a wolf alice + the japanese house + the 1975 concert at echo beach. <br><br>anyway. my most memorable concert was troye sivan in 2016? i’ll see him again in 2018 (?) but the night of that first concert was also the same night as the 2016 u.s. elections. the texture of that charged atmosphere is still vivid. we were all checking the vote count in between songs, even troye and his band. a girl in the crowd proposed to her girlfriend during “heaven” and it was that song that kind of finally broke me when i was going through videos the day after. there’s a strange companionship in going through something that uniquely, encompassingly traumatic as a collective; there’s camaraderie in the resignation you were all feeling together, this sense of joint grief that felt at odds with songs from troye’s album youth and yet not. i’ll always think of that evening as the exact moment the reality of my coming of age clicked into place. <br><br>but my all time fav concert was… the kpop group got7. it was the concert i was talking about in the quoted post here: https://huckleberry.substack.com/p/letter-six-right-now-and-always but they were my main guilty pleasure in my late teens/early 20s, and i always knew they wouldn’t be renewing with their agency; even if they didn’t disband once their contract was up, they’ll never again be a group enough to tour where i’ll get to see them. i spent a sum that hurt to be on the floor by the stage, only to be too short to properly see them — but this kind security lady noticed and escorted me to one of the vip sections where i could see the stage perfectly from up close. i still think about her whenever i pass the stadium the concert was held in. a stranger’s observation and kindness helped me enjoy to the fullest what was essentially a funeral for my fan devotion. it’s weird for an ending to also involve serendipity and celebration. there was grief there, too. it was as much my swan song as it was theirs to me. plus no one holds concerts like idol groups. period. <br><br>i also loved the high of lorde’s melodrama concert + it introduced me to mitski. alvvays is now one of my fav bands, but i got into them bc my friend’s tinder date had a ticket to spare. had a mundane interaction with snail mail in the bathroom at that concert too. and i have a fun little inside joke about a friend and i thinking we were seeing summer salt but it turned out they were only opening for turnover alongside the band mannequin p*ssy.</div>

 <div class=reply>this is so unbearably kind... whoa. Whoa. thank you ?? very much ?? i’m not sure if many of my friends online and off will agree with you honestly i’m kinda. probably not suited to being with people. if i’m much of a friend at all, i’d be like. the dad friend. instead of the mom friend. my love language is quiet protectiveness and long late night conversations where either lore is abruptly revealed or emotionally stunted advice is offered in place of inability to comfort through physical touch. i just. am not a very energetic person. and i think that’s reflected in my relationships. but it’s very touching to hear this, so thank you, thank you, thank you.</div>

 <div class=reply>sarah dessen novels, las vegas rolls, and sped up songs by the weeknd 😐<br><br>like slight tangent excuse me but i guess technically i don’t believe in guilty pleasures bc if it gives you pleasure then why feel guilty about an emotion that others wait all their lives to feel for even a moment, you know? plus the guilt really has more to do with being witnessed in that pleasure, doesn’t it? which to me defeats the purpose of the moral righteousness that tends to inform the pleasures you’re meant to feel guilty about. if you only feel bad about it bc you’ll be seen doing it, then it’s not about moral values—<br><br>but anyway. with that in mind, definitely those three things. i know the exact list of the weeknd songs i like and they were set in concrete until all of this stuff with the idol made me unable to even look at his face. but it’s there. it’s a thing. sarah dessen novels are so… does it not exhaust her to write the same archetypes of white suburban life? but she did teach me how to write coming of age stories in the way salinger did. and with sushi i’m usually happiest with salmon nigiri and some yam tempura maki but a las vegas roll has all the flavours and textures i love crammed into two bites max. it shouldn’t exist and yet it does and it’s heaven.</div>

 <div class=reply>i will be brief [insert a 14k paper]<br><br>no but it’s hard to answer this when you don’t have context but also just hard in the way that it’s hard to talk about things that are truly, truly good. there are things that are so good i pick it apart and marvel at how all of its pieces have been handled so well, but then there’s the tier above that, where everything is so inevitable as a unified whole, and so seamless in every sense of that word, that i can’t imagine it any different or poke at it and find a place that will give even under momentary analysis.<br><br>that said... i love our protagonist. i love that he exemplifies what it means to be a flawed, insane human being in a flawed, insane world, but his self-sacrifice/self-hate is never positioned as self-aggrandizing. i love that he can’t resist empathizing and sympathizing, that he doesn’t wield his own internal issues irresponsibly, that he learns and grows but remains grounded in a sharp, steady moral compass while also never losing sight of how there are things he can’t know unless he listens to others and accepts all the nuances possible. his selfishness is never about ego, and even his petty spite isn’t set aside to make him into a martyr or saint. this is someone who understands how much violence it takes to be kind, and someone who has seen people in power not assume the accountability and responsibility of being at the top. this resentment alone fuels him, but it’s reason enough to learn to be good. he has no need for pity, only trust and faith that he’ll do the right thing. he’s logical, but above all, he’s intuitive and flexible. he’s generous with his desire to do good by others, and he knows there’s no such thing as right or wrong, only power in hands that should be prepared to make choices befitting of having authority over how reality will bend to its most dominant ruler. <br><br>i love all the arcs and resolutions. i love raviel; the very unconventionality of her archetype and her rs with gongja deserves its own paper on romance and theme. i love the quiet subtlety and simplicity of the story mechanics, bc it’s with respect to their individual roles that intricacy in storytelling is given room to expand rather than forced into unnatural momentum. i love how unapologetically insane everyone is. i love how it takes a certain kind of necessary insanity to try and try again until no one and nothing has to be collateral damage, how it’s worth all the labour to ensure everyone retains their right to humanity, even those that have been cast aside in favour of the dominant narrative. i love that sssrh feels like both love letter and critique, but it’s also its own, indelible thing. <br><br>also: if you’ve read orv and are wondering how sssrh compares, tumblr user bidokja has worded it much better than i can here https://bidokja.tumblr.com/post/665008165291802625/i-remember-ages-ago-you-told-me-sssrh-was-better and here https://bidokja.tumblr.com/post/659260435172818944/what-does-sssrh-stand-for</div>

 <div class=reply>right !! makes me spiral every time !! definitely not one of mine... i think. but it could be so many other things. i wonder if you’re thinking about “someone has to leave first / this is a very old story / there is no other version of this story” from richard siken’s the worm king’s lullaby? it’s also a very common theme in poetry and greek tragedies. like “this was always going to happen / she's been dead since the beginning” from robert icke’s agamemnon adaptation or anne carson’s antigone translation. all three of these have been circulated quite a bit and have gotten popular enough to be equal possibilities, but they aren’t what you’re looking for, i have a tag for this concept that Might point you to a better direction than i can? maybe? https://nswers.tumblr.com/tagged/everything%20is%20about%20the%20carousel%20baby (sorry if i don’t have a definite answer, but i’ll keep an eye out for this exact iteration)</div>

 <div class=reply>i liked it a lot! i wasn’t expecting to get attached to it, mostly bc i feel like a lot of boygenius songs aren’t made to be in an album; there tends to be a palpable sense of whose lyrical/composing voice is strongest in one song, so to have them one after the other can feel as if the album is one long concept of a mashup of all their styles. it’s not a bad thing, but it does make it compatible for just picking the songs you like without evaluating the album itself. <br><br>but the record definitely felt more like a record. there’s more synergy to this album, in that it felt like a boygenius album more than a phoebe + lucy + julien album. their first ep was best in how it felt like the songs were in conversation with each other, but most of the record felt solid and concrete, like the conversations were happening inside the songs themselves, so it felt like it had proper arcs and catharsis and completion. as pretentious as all of this to say. <br><br>i liked true blue and not strong enough during the pre-release period, but we’re in love was the one that got me to put a hand to my mouth during my first full listen. the storytelling! the deceptive softness of the melody! the way the whole song sounds like a long question peppered with smaller ones asking for permission/assurance (isn’t it enough…? will you let me…? will you find me?)! and i’m always a sucker for the idea of “if you rewrite your life, may i still play a part? / in the next one, will you find me?” and “there is something about you that i will always recognize / and if you don't remember / i will try to remind you of the hummingbirds” as the first statement of intent. it’s such an interesting take on the “i will love you in every life” theme, so ofc it plays into my weakness for time loops/parallel universes/regressors, but also there’s just something eternal about knowing someone with understanding so bone-deep it’s built into the very vulnerability that makes all of this so bittersweet. which is honestly just a recurring theme in the record i enjoyed.<br><br>i also really liked letter to an old poet… such an interesting song to end the album on, ugh. the lack of structure, the diaristic free flow of it, the way it comes at its subject with hurt after hurt until it tires itself out. how love tinges anger with hurt above all, and this just loops in all other things that come with: regret, resentment, yearning to be happy, to be free. “i wanna be emaciated / i wanna hear one song without thinking of you” is so simple yet so efficient. it’s very reminiscent of all their other solo stuff, and not just bc it’s a concept that shows up in their respective songs. there’s something here that’s a return to form, so it feels like relief and release to end the album there.<br><br>these thoughts might change, though. i’ve found that my feelings about the album has shifted with more and more listens.</div>

 <div class=reply>i haven’t seen it, i’m sorry! but also i’ve been so wary about movies getting momentum among my circles since all the everything everywhere all at once hype set me up, so maybe it’s for the best that i don’t see it yet while everyone’s excited about it. but i loved the first one as much as the rest of the world and went to see it a couple times with different people so i’d love to at least see the sequel. there’s just no urgency at the moment, and it’s fun enough just seeing people talk about it like the most seamlessly united collective in recent memory. <br><br>i’ll get there eventually, but for now i’m sorry to disappoint 😞</div>

 <div class=reply>weirdly enough, this is one of the questions i’ve gotten the most. like this has to be the fourth and fifth time, and at this point, a part of me is wondering if maybe it’s a sign i Should get into naruto. so fascinating.<br><br>but honestly, no, i haven’t! i’ve definitely passed the window to become invested in the series as a whole — though it’s still fun to absorb what’s going on from people who have been consuming it since they were kids. i think that’s also partly how i know that it’s just not for me. i’ve never felt the urge to get into it, and the more i learn about it, the more sure i am of that. it’s nothing personal or negative. it’s just not my arena. some stories you just know is not your cup of tea.<br><br>though now i’m a bit curious why it keeps cropping up 🤔</div>

 <div class=question>hello! i hope your day has been well❣️<br>i hope it’s okay to ask but what/who would you recommend reading if one really like donna tartt? she’s the author that got me into reading and i can’t seem to find anyone else that makes me excited to read. i think the only other author that really drew me in aside from her is baldwin. i’ve reread tsh and giovanni’s room too much to enjoy another reread and would really like to find something new D:<br>thanks so much!</div>

 <div class=reply>it is more than okay! i think donna tartt’s style actually emulates older authors much more closely than anything contemporary, so it makes sense why you’re finding it tricky to find ones reminiscent of her prose. if you haven’t tried the goldfinch, i highly recommend it if you liked donna tartt’s prose in tsh. only she can do what she does, after all. plus her second book the little friend is forgettable as a whole, but if you just want to absorb her prose then it definitely delivers on that much. <br><br>hmm, what else… i’m so hernan diaz-pilled right now, so his book trust (which i’ve been raving about to everyone who would listen) is the first one to come to mind. brideshead revisited by evelyn waugh, light years by james salter, the bell jar by sylvia plath, maurice by e.m forster, demian by hermann hesse. maybe east of eden by john steinbeck, if you’re up for a longer read. a lot of these have coming of age themes in the way that tsh and the goldfinch are both coming of age in a way, but i’m mostly evaluating based on how closely they resemble that neo-romantic prose style that donna tartt uses. you don’t see it often in recent lit. authors seem to be geared towards less dense writing/more staccato sentence. sometimes it works for me, more often it does not.<br><br>in any case, if you haven’t read the goldfinch, that’s a great next place imo! i actually like it more than tsh. the only other author who manages such a them-only mood in their writing for me has been haruki murakami, and i barely like the guy. his novel wind-up bird chronicle is very adjacent to donna tartt, too, now that i’m thinking about it. otherwise, definitely look to older authors or authors with an “older” style for the same cadence in prose, or (like i did in hs) check the list of recent pulitzer prize winners. you start sensing a pattern after a while, but thankfully that means easy recs every year.</div>

 <div class=question>i have a crippling fear of missing out on things when I watch people enjoy things that aren’t available to me, and when they are, i feel like i gotta show everyone that i am enjoying them too or else the enjoyment is lackluster. do you? and do you have any idea how to get rid of it and how to start doing things because I like them and not because I want people to know that I like them?</div>

 <div class=reply>trying to find a way to word this gently, but honestly? that audience in your head? that perpetual voyeur? shoot them down. with cannonballs. rain hellfire down on them. they don’t matter. so much that when all the smoke and flames disperse from the scene, you’ll see they were all faceless mannequins and you’ve been trying to please and belong with nothing but wood and ash. even the real people whose approval you want are just. projections of concepts onto actual human lives. <br><br>i know it’s easy for me to say this bc i’ve never wanted validation on what/how/why i write/think/consume, let alone needed it. i can only imagine how agonizing it must be for you to feel like you’re missing out by not being part of the majority. to me, you already Are missing out by constantly needing to be seen enjoying a thing. that’s not enjoyment. needing to be seen will always just be needing to be seen. it’s almost a caricature of enjoyment and consumption, the things people default to needing when they want to belong. it’s not fair to anyone, to always be so afraid, to need to Not be denied the Full Experience of everything. but aren’t you tired? and isn’t that reason enough?<br><br>i don’t think there’s anything wrong with wanting a community when you enjoy something. i think that’s wonderful about humans. how we want to share our loves. it’s natural to want to belong. but do you find maybe that you distrust your own feelings? kinda like, “surely, my enjoyment can’t be real if it’s not enjoyment someone else feels the exact same way”? bc the high of being seen is not the same as the high of the emotion itself. do you even have the emotion enough to share it?<br><br>maybe being online has convinced us that the opinions of 1000+ people matter all at once, or that there’s one way to feel something. but neither is true. the fact that you’re even asking me this means you’re looking for a right way to love smth when the right way doesn’t even exist. there’s no universality. the people you want the validation of ultimately have no say in how you live it, and not all enjoyment is going to feel like another. it’s okay to consume things and think, “well. that sucked.” or even just “lol ok.” not every reaction has to be big to matter, and not everything has to reach many to count. often, you have to be a person to yourself to be a person to others, and it’s okay to take your time finding out who that person is. god knows that’s hard enough in itself. you might as well listen to the parts of you that agree or disagree to this or that, to accept your own reactions, to be present in the minute you’re living. there’s too much of life to waste only on forgettable things like approval as the end goal instead of genuine memories to collect long-term. <br><br>i know this tirade probably wasn’t helpful, but — i’m sending you the word equivalent of a hug. you won’t be crucified for having a self, you know. being alone does not equal rejection, nor is it reason to distrust what you feel.</div>

 <div class=question>(3/3) i'm rambling about this particularly now because the person who's shown this to me most intricately has been you, greatly. funnily enough, not that many people put in the kind of insane, immense care you do into listening to people. writing you was an exercise in dissection, illumination, elaboration. sometimes i think about an alternate universe where the curiouscat character count did not exist and we'd send each other ridiculous unspoolings of responses, back and forth. i loved the way you talked about flls and literally everything you wrote, and i was so –? i don't have the word for this, but kind of a lesssss extreme mix of fascinated/enamoured by how thoroughly you'd devote your consideration to things around you, including me? i was sixteen and bursting at the seams. i shone with that attention. then and growing to now, i've loved talking about myself and i've really, really loved talking to others about themselves, and you were such a marvel about that. i think i was a little weird about it (in an understandable way, sure) because i'd get a little thrilled at the very niche drama of having a little emoji reserved all for me, and being known as a regular figure to someone who i genuinely thought wouldn't notice me much. i don't know. i don't very much think that way anymore, given that i'm near the age or older than those i used to consider so far removed and cooler than me online – like, hello, we are all just little guys …….. anyways. <br><br>i'm not sure what this is – an overture of proper friendship? something rekindled? i'm not on twitter and i guess i'm now on curiouscat inasmuch as anyone can … really… be on cc, but i'd love to set up any correspondence; only if you'd like, of course. we can email, maybe! up to you, and i'm saying this from the bottom of my heart; i'd rather you didn't reply at all than feel untowardly pressured to, i swear. i did want to give you my name, though, no pretences – i've been the tiny fairy emoji and i THINK pari and probably zi, but my name is zaynah: friends get to keep my name, regardless of whenever we'd talked.<br><br>it's lovely to properly, finally make your acquaintance, and i'm glad i could write this to you. as always, don't feel any untoward obligation to reply proportionally, if at all – i do think most people aren't wild enough to write 1.3k to someone after months. but i digress. if you'd like to talk, though, i'd thoroughly love to oblige. i've been itching to listen to people i care about lately. <br><br>take care. all my love! stay shining.<br><br>- zaynah 🧚</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, i know it sounds like i’m being self-effacing/deprecating, but i do genuinely think all i ever offer is the bare minimum of what people deserve !! like, yes, we are all little guys, and i was no more special for any reason online than anyone else, but more so than that, i also just think (to loop back that thought in the last cc about language) that language deserves respect from us, and that includes the back-and-forths we have with each other. stranger or friend, online or off, work friend or friend friend. of course i’m cognizant of me being older and the different kind of responsibility i have to a teenager telling me about their relationship with art and poetry — but age doesn’t at all devalue the insight i could only get from your messages or from anyone younger than me. there is so much to learn from everyone around me who’s willing to arrange their thoughts into words for me to receive. that’s sacred to me. whether from a sixteen-year-old or a six-year-old or a sixty-year-old. i don’t think you were weird about it at all! trust me, i’ve had people shipping me with other ao3 writers in multiple different fandoms. i like to stay away from conversations about me mostly bc it’s beyond my emotional jurisdiction; what people tweet or say about me, it’s beyond the parameters of what is mine and my work’s. that’s theirs. i have no claim to it. but the words that people take the time to write about directly To me, whether in comments or ccs, whether long letters or just a “this song/show/art reminded me of you/something i thought you’d like” — again, that’s sacred. if anything, i count myself lucky to have people from all kinds of backgrounds, with their own loves and interests, would consider my little inbox worth the care and energy of sharing their thoughts. not to sound all saintly about it at all! i just think — i consider this cc a privilege more than you would expect. i mean, a space to hear from people and a space to share my thoughts over things i haven’t even reflected on? it’s a dream. <br><br>all this said — it’s an honour to finally make your acquaintance, zaynah ❣️ if there’s a word for how it feels to hear from you again after all this time, i still highly doubt it would be enough to share. all my warmth to you, always, always, and thank you for remembering me and taking the time to reach out with so much thoughtful effusiveness. a lot has changed with me since we last spoke, and i can’t even imagine how i was at the age/mental state i was then, but i truly wish you all the best in these upcoming chapters of your life, and please know my thoughts are always with you. <br><br>(if you want to drop your email in another cc that i won’t publish, i can email you from my own! if not, i’m not as inundated with messages on tumblr @ nswers, and i can share my email with you there, if you’d like! no pressure either way!)</div>

 <div class=question>(2/3) i think i remember two jobs, one with a publication(? as an editor? with a journal???? i do NOT recall) and one with those audio feature things? maybe i'm making it all up actually. how's work? how's the weather, how's your home? what have you been watching or thinking about? i haven't been on twitter in absolutely ages, but i do keep checking the urls of tumblr posts i like and realising it's you posting them. what poetry have you been reading? any art? any little curious things?<br><br>i think i understand your grappling with writing a little more now. maybe it's completely different, but i've been thinking about whether i deserve to call myself an artist, and, like, i'm good, okay? arrogance aside, i know my strengths and deficiencies, but that's not the problem. it's the… blue period of it all, the dignity and the deservingness that i can't help but think is inextricable from ambition for it – for expression – it's not about just art, it's not about whatever's quantified under the label of visual art or drawing or painting or whatever. i got a regional distinction in my o levels – i'm better than other people, depending on whatever shitty metric you use – but i never felt it right to call myself an artist when i'd refuse the ambition and the burden of its possibility. like. until i give it the respect of my esteem and my thoughts, until i feel like i've put not only technical but personal effort into a piece, this title will not belong to me; this because i know i haven't loved it enough; it is not coherent to me; i have not expressed anything consciously.<br><br>i learned about codes (technical and symbolic) and semiotics these past two years in media studies, though, and that was what bridged the gap between my LOVE my home my reading my books and my art – everything is language! so i shall only call myself an artist when i can speak that language, because right now my work exists barely coherent to ME, and that's what matters right now. not what other people see.<br><br>in this is an acknowledgement of thinking deeper, and more. what i've realised when studying literature is that it's most rewarding when you drop your pretences and see the possibilities as endlessly as you can. like, who cares if the curtains are empirically blue, right? why can't they be significant, either because the author wanted them to or because you see significance in it? how human and gorgeous is it that we can read meaning in simple, small things? like, shut up, whatever, you decide how deep something is, YOU create these infinite conceptions.<br><br>(CONTD. i have no idea about the etiquette for this how am i supposed to use it. dear god. contd... contd further.. i guess...)</div>

 <div class=reply>the audio job is still here! i have three jobs right now, but summer doesn’t typically find me in high spirits and it’s good to be busy. i’ve been working on a personal manuscript that’s ostensibly about a haunted house, but haunted houses are also one of those things that you can very easily spiral about dissecting so the manuscript has assumed like. fourteen incarnations by now. it’s driving me a bit crazy, but it’s always good to be driven a bit crazy by something writing related. overall i’ve been interested in soul/essence/feeling embedded into body/place/time/memory, but that’s a whole tangent i have no space for here oops <br><br>ahhh as i talk about myself it’s always as if i’m just approximating who i am as a person and then doing a subpar performance of that approximation. people never believe me when i say i’m not very interesting. but writing — writing is always safe to talk about. i think that’s partly how i’ve come to accept in the last year or so that i Am a writer. maybe not an artist, but a writer, at least. though maybe it’s never been about deserving the label for me. i’m aware of the standards and criticisms i levy against myself and my writing, how it’s solely my own approval i need to earn but what a steep hill that is to cross. it’s good, bc no one else can tell me i’m terrible if i feel like i’m not; someone can tell me a project is subpar, but if i know what i set out to do with it and it served its use, then what anyone else has to say about it holds no sway whatsoever. it won’t even make a dent. it’s not even in my mind. but that also means no one can really tell me i’m good and have me internalize it. if i don’t think i’m good, if i don’t consider a work fine, then it’s not. no matter who it moves or impresses. it’s freeing, to not need anyone’s validation. it’s lonely, too. <br><br>but i digress !! everything is language !! absolutely !! language is the currency upon which human reality is made concrete !! with that in mind, i do believe you can’t unlock the full depth of language if you approach it with a hierarchy in mind. you can’t ask language to come to you just bc you’ve proven yourself to some sort of rubric, or bc you’re good at what you do with it and that means it should submit to your hand. you serve writing, though not as its servant. you remain loyal to it, you respect it, you honour its layers with eternal curiosity, and sometimes that means defining what it means to be an artist before you can even think about earning being one. all this to say i understand what you mean and am nodding alone 😓 there’s nothing more infinite than language. not even money. it’s wonderful. i’ve been reading trust by hernan diaz recently and loving it, and i think “infinite conceptions” truly is the best term for all of it, you’re so right.</div>

 <div class=question>hi, sha–<br><br>how are you doing?<br><br>i'm going through a lot of endings and beginnings around right now. i'm trying to figure everything out all over again and it's a quiet 2am right now and i'm feeling the need to write to you again, so strongly – so i am. i do and have missed talking – to you and your curious brilliance, of course, of course, fondly now and always – but also in the sense of being able to…to? expel, and have my own words be marked as concrete. and i really am sorry i haven't been in touch in so long. you were a lovely penpal and confidant, and still so an awfully stand up friend on top of those. just as i loved being able to share myself with you, i valued what you shared of yourself as much if not more. <br><br>i'm eighteen now! i've graduated high school, and i'm off to uni in lahore in the fall (which i am SO excited for) under their sociology &amp; anthropology program, maybe hopefully probably with an english minor. this is absolutely at least a little bit in part due to you, by the way. i remember you told me about the archiving/oral history work you did and something about that just struck a chord with me – like, i didn't take socio in school, but i thought it out again and again and it's just a thorough, good reconciliation of obligation, curiosity, and ambition, so i'm happy! plus passion and interest, yes, though i will never love anything as deeply as i love books – that belonging is deep as bones. <br><br>what else? i've had lovely friends, no romances (which i'm very placidly okay with), though no best best BEST friends either, unfortunately (the real tragedy of my life). i'm growing to love the way i look and dress. i'm building closeness with my family, especially my mother and brother, the latter of which is 6ft+, growing taller, and i am MOURNFUL. i'm mending things with my sister, just a little. i'm sitting here loving my father and cousin, too! i come from good people and lots of love, which is just so. so. yeah. i'm editor-in-chief of my year's yearbook after singlehandedly commandeering half the compilation and all of the design of the last one (YES this is me BRAGGING i am justified!! they should've paid me!!) i read 29 books in may. i wrote graduation letters to my friends and teachers and it was good and cathartic and right, to get the chance to say important things. i feel strangely, keenly estranged sometimes, and then other times i talk to people and it's like a match is being struck and coaxed alive again. but i'm so lonely sometimes, in a way i think is like dead plants in winter. it will be okay. i'm growing, painfully and well. i've been thinking of art.<br><br>i can't even remember the last time i contacted you – i'm going to read your huckleberry letters soon, though; i re-stumbled across them about a month ago and i've been saving them for a rainy special day. i don't know how long it's been! are you still in canada? do you still have those – (CONTD.: 1/3)</div>

 <div class=reply>where to even start, oh my god — i feel like anything i come up with runs the risk of cliché, but i think that’s just a default when it’s been so long since you last spoke to someone, and especially with the slightly unconventional pen pal dynamic we have. all this to say that i brightened up so much when i realized it was you messaging !! you were one of the very first frequenters of this inbox, you know. you’re never far from my mind whenever i think about the early days of this cc, in the same way you’re never far from my mind when i listen to luz. for what it’s worth, and with both the openness and the distance of our back-and-forth, i owe a lot to the foundation you helped make concrete in letting me get accustomed to not being apologetic for how i talk about my writing and how i answer ccs. <br><br>but anyway !! i’m absolutely not important here. happy birthday! i can’t believe you’re 18! it’s been that long since we last spoke? congratulations on graduating high school and transitioning to uni, too, my god. and socio/anthro sounds so, so cool. some of my fav classes in uni were both, and it’s funny you mention how we used to talk about archiving/oral history, bc i’ve also been reflecting lately on how much more rewarding it would be to work in archives/libraries/museum backrooms than the people-heavy work i’ve been doing lately. i’m finding lately that saying i want to be with people, that i truly love people, is sounding more and more like a lie — though i wouldn’t say i’m being particularly misanthropic, either. there’s nothing negative about it. i’m just struggling lately to find a reason for wanting to be with the world, and to share parts of me that feel like… i’m just handing away. not much more is left inside me. but it’s strange to say that bc it sounds so morbid, or alarming, which isn’t what i mean either. i don’t know. i’m not disillusioned per se. i still love writing about people. i’m just not very endeared atm to the whole Being A Person Among People thing, is all. but that might just be the transitions going on in My life. so.<br><br>it’s tricky finding the right words to wish you well in uni. i know you have a lot of transitory years ahead of you, and i don’t know what to wish someone for whom both the violence and rewards of coming of age will gather more and more momentum moving forward — but above all, i think i just hope that you never lose sight of how important it is to be curious, to cultivate your interests, to pay attention not just to what you love but what you can learn to love. something something susan sontag’s vassar college speech. i’m not worried about it, though. you’ve always had a palpable sense of direction in your emotions and reflections, so please never forget that you have someone on this side of the ocean believing like hell in you on as you evolve and evolve and evolve ☀️</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, that’s a massive honour to hear, thank you! honestly, for itfs… never say never. i can’t promise anything, and who knows if i’ll ever feel a desire to dust off some of my unfinished wips, but the thing about jjk is that i never would have written so much for it if it the source material didn’t leave me so dissatisfied. there’s definitely more stuff there that i could write, but whether or not i get the urge to depends only on being invested in the series again to the point of writing fic for it. which right now feels unlikely, but it can totally change when, for example, jjk ends. that sort of thing. so again, no promises, but it’s certainly not a hard, definite no :)</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no not silly at all! it’s a Great question, but there’s nothing profound to it, really, i just prefer to keep everything on my end of ao3 business as minimal and no-nonsense as possible. tags, summaries, even author notes. my general reservations about tags aside — if i can get away with not tagging at all, i would. my compromise is to just try fulfilling my basic duties with only the tags that are absolutely necessary, and that doesn’t really include character tags. since i can’t really think of any benefits to tagging more but the opposite is a win-win situation, i choose the latter. doesn’t hurt that it’s also just nicer to look at when there’s no clutter in the tags or notes sections. not having to spend time on which characters and tropes to tag before i send the fic off + a neater look without them = happy sha 🌟<br><br>a couple anons in the past Have suggested that i should tag more so more people read my fics but that’s not really who i am, you know? people find my fics when they do, and i’d like it to remain that way, whether by word of mouth or just by complete accident. i prefer to be as hands-off as possible with the finding readers thing. it’s more pleasant this way. whatever preserves that best beyond taking my fics down from search engines is the avenue i’ll choose. <br><br>the bottomline is that i tag so minimally half for shallow/superficial reasons and half to save myself the trouble. that’s really it. i’m sorry if this is a more disappointing answer than you expected 😥</div>

 <div class=reply>listened to it just now and ohhh i can’t believe i didn’t put it in the playlist before this :( it’s interesting bc flls feels so alien and far away to me now, more so than any other fic, but there are still artists that i associate with it alone whenever their songs come on shuffle. i never expect to miss them bc flls got such a neat ending that i Know they’ll be fine and there’s nothing more to write, but then a song like see you later by jenna raine or i knew by lizzy mcalpine comes on and it feels like i’m back there, a couple years ago, writing chapter six on my old laptop. to have a world feel so real to you when you’re writing that it feels like you truly physically left it behind when you finished it — it’s a privilege that never gets old to be reminded of how special that is, so tysm for sharing this thought with me.</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhh idk if this is a serious question but i do have a semi serious answer here if it is https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1319273167<br><br>otherwise — maybe! maybe not! it’s really, really hard to say! one can never be sure with me and my whims 😓 there’s so much fic i still haven’t gotten to write, and who knows, maybe i’ll get into something in the future that plants an itch that will need scratching, but right now, i just have the feeling it’s time to step away from fics at least for a while and actually get serious about writing. not that i have a great track record with that, but again. we’ll see where the next few months take me. in any case, thank you for caring about that little tweet.</div>

 <div class=reply>it is an original work, yes! but no no there wasn’t like. an epiphany or anything. i just think there’s a point where it feels like the right time to start a project, and it’s felt like The Time for the manuscript since i finished hairpin turns. it just happened that i started another fic on a whim and it went on for longer than i expected it to. i’ve always had the feeling that blue lock was going to be my last arena for a while, and even if The Manuscript wouldn’t be keeping me occupied in the meantime, that probably would have still been true. blue lock gave me so much room to sit with as many of my most urgent thoughts as possible and to get all the fundamental writing warm ups and experimentation out of the way, and beyond that freedom, there’s nothing i’m itching to write for right now. <br><br>i also think... my time writing fics for blue lock is perfect to end on in a lot of ways. the kind of too neat and too right i can only dream of. i’ve had the absolute best time writing these fics, and i’ve been lucky to hear it has come across and that i get to talk about writing with bllk readers and just soak up their thoughts and energy. i’m very grateful. my bllk fics and readers have given me the fic author experience of a lifetime, so maybe i just feel protective about this love between me and this particular era of writing. i want to bottle it up and keep it where it can never be tainted. if this is the last i ever give of me to fic writing and they the people to receive it — that’s amazing. i wouldn’t want nor need anything else if this happens to be my last ever. there’s closure here if i need it. <br><br>thank you so much for saying you you’ll support me either way, but i promise there’s absolutely no expectation nor obligation to be here for anything except what you came for, whatever that might be. just know that i already owe a lot to readers like you for being around at all for my silly little fics, and that’s worth more than enough to me, truly.</div>

 <div class=reply>there’s a chance that it might not be ever !! it’s hard to say !! but definitely last fic for a while. there’s nothing i want to write fic for at the moment, and my blue lock fics + readers fed me so well that i don’t think i’ll be hungry for anything any time soon. so. maybe more of an indefinite hiatus…? i didn’t mean to alarm anyone by sounding a death knell with that tweet :(</div>

 <div class=reply>oh gosh not at all... years ago i wanted to work in forensics/criminology/law, but i found myself with no financial support by the time i was 16 and kinda just. made strategic choices. i know that sounds cold but i figured it wouldn’t matter if i studied biochem or philosophy as long as i had a diploma to slap onto a buffed cv, so i just ended up picking what interested me most and would thereby encourage me to truly apply myself bc that way i can get the best loans/grants/scholarships and focus on beefing up my portfolio on the side. for me, undergrad was an investment that would turn up profit if i bet on my stocks well. i was of the opinion (and still am, lowkey) that paying a school to teach me something i’d pursue on my own time just fine was a waste of my already limited resources. i thought school was a good as much as anything else. i didn’t see a reason to pay for it AND dedicate time and money to it in the same way i don’t go to a restaurant and ask them to let me cook my own meal. i chose a double major in classics and linguistics bc i felt like those were two things i’d never be able to cover myself quite the same way, but also bc both encompassed everything i would need for any job i could imagine wanting to do. classics covered the humanities side, from languages to art conservation, and linguistics covered everything from neuroscience to anthropology. plus they gave me time left over to work for the school newspaper during the school year and at a magazine fellowship in between semesters as well as as a research assistant for a professor in the classics department. that left me with quite the work history by the time i graduated, and academia just felt too indulgent as a next step. if i want emotional fulfillment in pursuing what i love or to finish a project or to get the credentials/experience, i can just. do it. i Do just do it. i wasn’t thrilled about the idea of paying someone to give me permission or guidelines to do what i love.<br><br>but i’m not saying i’m too good for academia !! god no. i miss school a lot these days. but its costs render it a luxury, and one that i feel i can make my way contentedly without for now. i’ve been so blessed to get work in sectors that people do school/internships to have on their resume, and it’s led me to the slightly unexpected jobs i’ve had. i just got a position as a copywriting lead for a literary agency, but before that i was working for my dream publication. i also work as an audio producer for two magazines. it’s always more fun to do things that feel novel and challenging, i find. last year, i had both an actor era and a barista era, so who knows, maybe i’ll brush off those research assistant roots and try academia someday! that would be nice. it just feels like a lot of idle time and too much commitment rn.<br><br>my point is — i’m less of an intellectual and more restless traveler always looking for a new high. but i do appreciate this cc and i’m so sorry for going on a tangent 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>i wasn’t familiar with it before this cc, so thank you for thinking of me! i thought the premise was right up my alley, so i ended up reading it right then and there. y’all know i love my exes/second chance romance dynamics, and the lovely art didn’t hurt. <br><br>i’m also always intrigued by relationships with a… class divide? for lack of a better term? k-media love their rich/poor tropes, but i’m also thinking of normal people by sally rooney. how does a romance between people with fundamentally different understandings of money and power navigate that difference? especially in stories like spring, the color of love, where one half of the pairing is a chaebol, how do you reconcile one of you having inherited wealth while the other has defined survival in a way the other will never have access to? i know that’s reading too much into it, but it’s such an unavoidable part of situation imo. the rich one can throw money at the rs all they want, and there is a lesson for the other that not everything has to be a fight and they can just accept gifts and kindness, but realistically, how do you make that work? <br><br>this manhwa started off strong with cheongsoon: he made sense not just as someone who’s the victim of how “poverty has a way of being passed down” but as someone who wasn’t emotionally available bc when you live like him, everything comes at a cost. yet the way the story set that up as a realistic core then shuffled it to the side in favour of this… i wanna say underlying attitude of disregard? towards that theme, but also the characters towards their jobs, their social roles in the company, the few women in their lives — i think that’s where it lost me in the end. so many of the later plotlines felt contrived even with slivers of realism, which was disappointing bc it had all the facilities to be good and nuanced and still portray a love for the ages. i love a romance that’s about selfishness and choosing each other no matter what, but the love here just felt standoffish rather than selfish in the name of love, if that makes sense. kinda like. they really couldn’t give a shit about the realities of the world they live in/the people around them, and not in the way that’s fun and touching to see. also. i saw someone in the comments say “dear author this plot twist sucks” about the brother thing and — yeah.<br><br>sorry i’m like rambling a litany of complaints but the fact that i read it all is a good thing !! don’t get me wrong !! the expressions were drawn so well, and the manhwa was at its best when there was no dialogue/narration. i loved the casual intimacy; it’s rarer than it should be to see couples in romance just be Comfortable like that. the strongest conflict for me was cheongsoon’s uncle. that was when i was like. oh, okay, they haven’t forgotten about the differences threaded into who they are and how they’ve learned to want things in the world. and the final scene where it’s revealed what the last thing he left behind was is quite nice.</div>

 <div class=reply>funny you say that bc sae is unequivocally my bllk favourite and i find it a shame that i can go on and on about sdse around friends/on priv but only got to write them for real in one hyperspecific au, so i’m incredibly glad to hear that the fic was alright despite that... thank you so so much for taking the time to write to me here with such sweet and earnest words 🥹💗<br><br>hmm i don’t have that many fics in my mental bank in general, to be fair, but not bc i think i’m too good for them omg i am definitely not it's just. a bunch of other things combined. all the gold in the rnbc tag was a genuine shock to my system, for example, bc the stars don’t align often in terms of my pairing preferences, the characterization i like to see, etc. <br><br>for sdse, the only fic i have in mind is this outsider pov that i basically know by heart by now: ao3.org/works/43583449. this author Does indulge a lot, so i feel strange advertising this primarily as a character study, but including all their other sdse fics, they’re really the only one i’ve seen handle sae… i don’t want to say Well, bc that implies my view is the only right one and i’m not willing to entertain alternatives, but with all the nuances that align with the ones i see in sae, at least. i’ve had to accept from spending time in the tag that sdse is just. hard to pull off. it’s easy for a story not to feel like sdse anymore if an author isn’t careful. when you portray shidou as someone at sae’s beck and call unconditionally, for instance, you run into a risk of making him not completely shidou. yes, he defers to sae, but he’s not truly submitting to him. he calls sae out for going easy on rin, negotiates when he can’t get what he wants outright. control is so specific to sae’s everything, on the other hand, but it’s how that plays a part in his rs with shidou that leaves him consciously vulnerable to him too. shidou likes it when sae is rough with him, but it’s the same for sae. sae needs shidou under him, but shidou also needs sae above him. it’s constant power renegotiation, and not every kind of fic allows for that, understandably. but this author does a lot of wonderful balancing on that regard esp in this fic (e.g. how a lifetime of being wanted has taken its toll on how sae sees desire vs. how he Does get off on being owned by shidou as much as he does owning shidou). sae is just. a seesaw of a character. simple physics, but it takes effort to balance both ends. this author might be indulgent but to me they also just get the sleight of hand of the canon sdse dynamic, their unique dialogue and body language, the vulgarity and perversion of their attraction to eo yet the necessity of mutual trust for them to work at all. that, and outsider pov is just the best trope to use for these two bc they’re terrifying and awe-inspiring and really goddamn inscrutable yet the only thing that makes sense for the other. this fic is like a winning bingo card to me.</div>

 <div class=reply>that brings me back whoa i had the most insufferable beats phase in my last year of high school bc of k/ll your darlings 😭 looking back i didn’t even love most of it, just that it was the sparse but urgent writing style i aspired to at the time. i loathed kerouac then and loathe him now, but i think some of his best work is in the essay collection lonesome traveler. i also really liked bob kaufman’s poetry and used to recite pieces of “a terror is more certain” in my head during situations i didn’t want to be mentally present in. the book of martyrdom and artifice was my fav ginsberg, but i also encourage anyone interested in him to look at his later work in life; i find that his contributions to conversations around american participation in drug production and the vietnam war highlight his views as much as howl does. other than that, the lasting impact of my beat phase was mostly in how it led me to an even worse susan sontag phase and a teenage devotion to franny and zooey by salinger… which are their own thing. but my memory from that time period isn’t very good/reliable, and i’m sure there was more i liked if i was that insufferable about it and just can’t recall now i’m sorry :( <br><br>on that note, sontag + andrea long chu are the only two essayists that i would say i love In General-in general these days. that, and i have a soft, soft spot for kyo maclear’s work. brandon taylor i feel shines more in nonfiction, whether his newsletter or magazine essays, while jia tolentino excels more in her new yorker pieces than in a themed essay collection like trick mirror. maggie nelson has as many hits as she does misses, larissa pham comforts me even when she doesn’t excite me. anne carson defies the traditional structure of all genres she writes in that in my head she’s a translator before she is a poet or an essayist, but i think she writes with her trademark acuity even in works like eros the bittersweet. <br><br>and as for how i am… it’s alright. like. i’m alright. certain symptoms always get worse around this time of the year, and i’m just trying to manage them. it’s hard not being able to sleep well, mostly. summer is always incredibly difficult. otherwise i’m alive and alright and not giving anyone any trouble — but tysm for genuinely asking !! i also hope you’re taking it easy !!</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha hope you’re doing well ^-^ how do you feel about growing older now? is it different to how it felt when you were 16? and 18 or 20? i’m turning 22 and i’m excited at the thought of it but also kind of sad about it, only because i feel like sometimes i may be too old for certain things and what not, but i try to not think that way. i’m just at that “wow i cant believe im not 19 anymore” thought process v-v</div>

 <div class=reply>absolutely omg i think it’s been this gradual shift of birthdays being a whole internal process in the years between 16 to 20, a kind of emotional and mental recalibration of the age and self you now are after each one, then 21 and 22 was full of this sense of urgency and over-awareness that i’m not doing enough/running out of time. which i don’t believe is true now, but this year is also the first year where i’ve felt like. ok. another year older. cool. there’s neither joy-grief nor existential dread. it’s just another day. there’s a reason to hang out with friends and have cake and receive wonderful cards and letters, all of which i’m thankful for, but it’s also a stage of life where the truth that grounds me is that things will go on no matter what, even if it’s a bad day or a birthday. <br><br>i guess that’s what getting older is to me now. when you grow up aware of the things you’ve had to live through or survive, you also have this awareness of what you can’t have/what you still don’t have. which i feel like i’ve finally shed. i know that i am one year wiser and more equipped for the future than i was a year ago. that’s all that matters, even if it might not be ultimately true. i’ve experienced more anyhow. thought more, had more conversations, written more. i can’t ask for much else. <br><br>but i do think you’re allowed to feel somber about not being 19 anymore! you put so much work, whether conscious or not, into growing into your 19, 20, 21 year old self, and now you have to shed that and start over. it’s not straightforward or comfortable, even if it’s a more subconscious process for some than others. not to mention these are the years that will come with the most transitions for a lot of us; for most, that means these are also the years to come with the most loss. change means moving away from things, starting over, which are its own wells of grief. anyone should be allowed that.<br><br>people tend to get discouraged when they check themselves every year and find that not much has changed, or that they might be doing worse somehow than their “better” years — but what i do know is that this is rarely true, and there’s no perspective quite like the one you have when you’re 23 and seeing how young your 13 year old self was, and i assume that will only grow more and more true the further you go into the future, until you’re 33 and thinking wow, what a baby i was at 23. such is the bitterness of the shifting nature of life, but also its sweetness? these days, i think it’ll be cool if you can look back at more than just the last year and know that if you sit with the you of, say, 10 years ago, maybe more, you can have a conversation with two drastically different approaches to the same topic despite being the same person and even if you agree on some pieces of it. <br><br>but anyway! i have rambled enough. a late happy birthday to you, and i hope 22 is gentle with your heart 🌷</div>

 <div class=reply>this a tricky one hmm the mech community is... finicky. the better engineered a board is, the more it costs to manufacture; the more a board costs, the longer it tends to ship out and the more exclusive the group buy will be. quality boards are produced on an interest check &gt; group buy &gt; aftermarket system: if there’s enough demand for a board pitched on geekhack, various countries will open group buy preorders and note an estimate on which quarter of what year it will ship out. once it arrives for those who bought, there will be slim chances to grab a kit yourself until another round of group buys happen, if at all. however if a board has great resale value or if the person who got one didn’t like it, you’ll see some go up in places like r/mechmarket or the keebsforall marketplace.<br><br>some find it a pain, honestly. but recent years have seen an uptick in lower end but affordable mass-produced keyboard kits, and there are people who are happy with cherry mx switches on ajazz/feker/epomaker boards, which are dirt-cheap and does the job if you just want any kind of mech keyboard. if you want to experiment with building your own, sites like kbdfans and novelkeys have kits that can help introduce you to the basics of the hobby. they’re… not amazing, but if someone’s starting out and isn’t particular yet about what they’re looking for, they’re useful budget beginner keebs. you can pick your parts and even have keebs built for you, and from there explore keycaps and cables, which have their own systems. i’d say that right now mode designs offers the best balance of beginner accessibility and quality. my personal fav keyboards from them are no longer in production, but only bc they changed business tactics to now offer the sonnet and the envoy; both give you good enough room to experiment with plates, designs and diff ways to build a board without relying on the group buy system, plus there are multiple build videos from yt channels and even mode themselves to give you an idea of how to go about it all. <br><br>i guess the place to start would just be the fundamentals of a build. i recommend looking at youtubers like alexotos, who’s the only good big name in the hobby imo, but :3ildcat and rice cloud have cheaper builds while filledtypes has a good mix. off these, you can familiarize yourself with the parts of a keeb: keycaps (comes in a few diff profiles), plate (a big spectrum of materials), pcb (can be either hotswap or solder; i advise against soldering as a beginner), and switches (comes in three diff types, all of which have their own idiosyncracies)<br><br>really, you won’t know what you like until you’ve tried them all. between you and me, if you just want to try building a keeb, then a bluetooth hotswap one or smth from kbdfans/mode will do just fine. no need to get into the nitty gritty. it’s a consuming hobby that’s drastically different for everyone, not to mention the costs can get ridiculous. so. i hope this provides an idea of what to expect 🙁</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha🫶🏼 i hope this isn’t too much but you make me very hopeful. like. hearing you speak about your rs with solitude and reading/writing after going through a few years not being able to do either— it makes me very hopeful. <br>i have a gut-feeling that one day i’ll return to writing despite not wanting anything to do with it atm, and though i’m alright with admitting that now, it is still hard to surrender even if only momentarily. <br>i know it is only pretentiousness (and my scorpio moon sign, unfortunately) to make me feel in any capacity that my emotions are unique. i know they are not, but i guess i haven’t seen anyone as honest as you are about things. it’s really nice to see, makes me feel more human than accident.<br>this is such a long way to say thanks for being Real. but. yeah. thanks for being Real. <br><br>hope the days have been gentle, that your hands have only been love💌</div>

 <div class=reply>oh wow wow wow… this is a longwinded preface feel free to skip to the next paragraph but it’s funny bc i do wonder often if i come across as ingenious or inauthentic from the way i use… words? grimacing as i write that but i think i always brace myself to be called cold and/or pretentious (which i don’t consider wrong; i do probably have a tendency to be too objective or detached), yet inauthentic is one of those criticisms that feels unfair and reaches me in a slightly more childish place. in an “oh, bc i have to think about how to say things, my thoughts and emotions are too calculated to be authentic?” kind of petty way. which. i also understand that being careful with words translates to what others might see as inauthenticity for a reason. nothing i can do about that. in the end, i’m just not a terribly emotive person. <br><br>ALL THIS TO SAY that i really want to be honest. in my interactions, in my writing, in my relationships. i know it’s not always possible, or successful the way i want it to be. so it means a great, great deal to hear you say this, is all i want to say. and that i don’t think of it as surrendering, to pause writing right now. ofc you never know if or when you’ll return to it if you take a step back right now, but in my eyes, giving yourself room to breathe and to find other things to love just as much if not more than writing is a pursuit that has no cons. you as a writer goes as deep only as far as you the person. i believe that wholeheartedly about artists. you as a person comes first bc it will only ever help sustain your craft in the end. <br><br>and i mean. your emotions Are unique exactly bc you’re more human than accident. accidents can only be statistics, i’d argue. even if the thread of the emotions we feel runs the same through multiple people, it will always be unique to the individual in the end. that doesn’t mean you should see yourself as a villain or a failure for feeling what feels unique. i don’t think emotions themselves have inherent moral value, especially if they’re reactionary, and that’s what makes your feelings more than a statistic. if this roundabout logic makes sense. <br><br>thank you once again, and i also hope your days have been nothing but gentle 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>sha is a short version of my first name! it’s a nickname that irl friends and biological family also use, etc. i’ve heard people interpret my full first name with everything from noble to thirst to prophetic/persuasive, but oh, “salvage” is such a singularly wonderful sentiment that blows them all out of the water :( slight tangent but in jojo’s bizarre adventure there’s one character with the ability to create life from nothing and another with the ability to fix things that have been broken, whether to heal or to repair, and it’s always meant a lot to me that it’s the latter whose power the story highlights as the “kindest of all.” creating life is one thing; it’s another to salvage. this reminded me of that, so although it’s not my full name and one can never be sure how well it applies it to me, it moves me incredibly that you took the time to share so thank u very very much 🥹🤍</div>

 <div class=question>how can you write so surely about love all across those fics of yours when you have never fallen in love yourself? how can you be sure that your readers relate to your oddly specific descriptions of love and longing, that’s of course if you care about relatability at all, and that they grasp what you mean and not wonder “what are they going on about…?” i am a writer myself, and don’t get me wrong bc i really appreciate your work. it’s just that i find myself knitting my brows upon reading you sometimes</div>

 <div class=reply>that’s a question i’ve asked myself a lot, too, honestly, but i guess the best (longwinded) answer i have is that i get restless at the idea of only writing things i already know, whether in plot or worldbuilding, etc. ofc there are exceptions, but i’ve always thought it will severely limit the stories i can write if i had to had to know things first to write them rather than open myself up to the discovery process as i write/be as open as possible to learning as i go along. speaking as Just Some Guy trying to approximate a human life in their stories knowing it will never be perfect, it’s not as if i had to survive a war and raise a daughter myself to try my absolute best writing detour, or have an unfulfilling career in film to take a shot at writing a 27-year-old retired actor. <br><br>it’s the same approach to me with writing characters in love? as a personal preference, i’m not super comfortable making characters act as megaphones for my own feelings. i think that’s what my nonfiction stuff are for. whether it’s parenthood or ptsd from being an idol/pianist/artist or being in love, what i consider my job as a writer is to drop into the lives of the characters. i can’t speak for others, and ofc plenty of writers write from inside themselves as much as some actors work complete magic while method acting — but for me, writing happens to be a chance to take on roles that can’t be more different from me and satisfy some curiosities that way. <br><br>i think maybe that’s why i love writing romance and characters not the same age/gender/nationality/personality type i am. i won’t be able to experience what they do otherwise, and the joy of writing is that i Do live with them for as long as i am writing their world. their longing is my longing, their love is my love, their lows are my lows. all that. it’s arguably easier for fics, bc the canon source gives me an existing character who sees the world in a specific way for specific reasons, and as long as i approach them with the intent to understand, the hope is that i’ll also come to understand the way they might or might not love another person. <br><br>i try my best, at least. i don’t know if i think about making my characters likeable/relatable, though i hope to make the story as comprehensible yet complex as i can. that’s the extent of how i consider the “what are they going on about…?” thing you mention. from metaphors to introspection, i’d say i just work with the assumption that it will Always be too specific to be universally relatable. i guess that lends me its own lens, nudges me to chase more, specify more, add colour or whatever. i never know how successful i am at it. that any of it ends up relatable to readers shocks me every time.<br><br>this has gotten too pretentious oops but the tl;dr is that my not knowing isn’t exclusive to being in love. i don’t know anything, ever, when i write. it’s my fav feeling in the world. i just try my best. the best attempt is what both i and the reader end up with.</div>

 <div class=reply>no no, don’t worry, but i’m afraid i’m not the right person to ask for this... i wanna say it takes quite a lot to anger me to a point beyond damage control, but once that threshold has been abused, i’m not much of a forgive-and-forget person. so. i’m unsure myself how to answer. <br><br>i think… the most important of any apology is to be sincere and accountable, and to know that reasoning is not automatic justification. if i were to apologize to someone, i think the best i can do is to know and acknowledge the ways i might have hurt them, and to not word it in such a way that the onus to prove the reality of the hurt is on them. so no “i’m sorry you felt hurt…” or “i’m sorry that you took it the wrong way…” bc if you’re the one who inflicted the harm, then you don’t assign the responsibility to the other person. lowering yourself also isn’t the way to uplift them, meaning that “i am such a terrible person for doing this, i keep doing things wrong, no one likes me” is not the same as “i know i did a terrible thing to you.” with that in mind, i think whenever we have to apologize, we must also do it with the awareness that the other person should not be cornered into the reply We want. you don’t apologize just so you’ll be forgiven, and we have to accept that people have the right to not forgive, or the right to move on and start over without necessarily accepting the apology. so as far as telling you how to apologize, i think a crucial chunk is not to get ahead of the other person. you don’t get to tell them how they need you to make it right. <br><br>i guess the main points of what i’m trying to say is: be direct and honest about what you did wrong, and acknowledge that your reasons for doing it does not make the fact that you hurt someone any less of a truth. you give the other person space to do what they want with the apology, and if they want to talk more, be open to that. don’t be a doormat, either. own up to any damage from you without turning it into a whole talk of how you’re the worst person in the world for even thinking to do it; that has nothing to do with the thing you did. if the other person did something wrong to you, be as honest and direct about it as you are in your apology without framing it in such a way that it’s like an eye for an eye (i.e. “i hurt you bc you hurt me so now we’re even.”) that’s not an apology. <br><br>i think apologies are like rowing a boat with one other person. that short, upfront, back and forth motion. but i also don’t know the exact situation you’re working with, and it could very well be that i’m being too prescriptive to harmful degrees. i think the main thing is just. to make space in the big conversation for as much of both of you as possible. if that makes sense. <br><br>i hope this can be helpful in any way at all ahhh i am wishing you the best of luck and i hope things go alright in whatever way that might mean for both of you 🙁</div>

 <div class=question>hi, sha - i hope that spring has been treating you kindly so far! <br><br>i'm not too sure how to phrase this (and especially without the risk of sounding pretentious or overdramatic omg i'm so sorry if it comes off like that!!), but do you ever feel completely numb, or as though every part of you is numb but your heart feels really heavy? i feel like i've been grieving the same person for far too long - they've just naturally kind of fallen out of my life after weaving in and out of it with months in-between, and likely aren't coming back this time. i know that life is at least partly a culmination of everything you learn and feel and the people you meet (i guess john locke was right in the end) and that meeting people is a cycle in that some people are meant to leave you with a lesson, but i wish i knew when it would stop hurting, and how it's so unfair that i don't get a say in how disproportionate the hurt of someone leaving is to the importance of the things i've learned from them. i feel like i'm grieving someone who isn't even dead. which isn't of course to say that i don't value the relationships who've stayed! but i think that there's a kind of numbness that only certain people are able to fill, or at least when you're a teenager approaching adulthood at a terrifying pace. i guess i just wish i knew what to do - i feel like joy has been coming to me so limitedly and fleetingly in solitude lately, and even things like reading books i love and writing don't bring me the same sort of happiness - i don't go out with my friends much, but when i do, i feel a very temporary happiness which despite it's temporariness is still more than what i feel when i'm doing a hobby i used to enjoy doing by myself, and that therapy, which i try to be consistent with, makes me feel even lonelier than before since it's like putting all my wounds out on display and forcing myself to look at them.<br><br>like, i feel like when i'm reading, i'm just reading for the sake of having finished a book rather than truly enjoying it. i think i've always been so desperate to reach the made-up threshold of being "well-read" (&amp; wishing to read to try to "absorb" the prose of good authors in another desperation to become a better writer) as a consequence of being raised in a vv western academic setting + around mutuals who are writing geniuses. like there's those few books which remind me there's joy in literature - i felt it when i finished real life, and when i finished the heart's invisible furies, among a few others - but i so rarely come across a book i'm able to finish since i feel so picky about silly things like prose and setting that i have more drops than nots. <br><br>this cc is all over the place now that i look back at it i'm so sorry, i guess i'm asking how to feel joy in solitude, escape the grief of people still alive, love reading again, and if there's a way to isolate reading from personal writing and be able to do it just for fun without thinking of self-improvement</div>

 <div class=reply>you are never in danger of sounding pretentious To Me of all people omg<br><br>hmm i think when you have a certain rs with this idea of what fullness feels like, you run into danger of being more aware of emptiness. you get the instinct to hoard, to gorge. you see an absence left behind and the only thing that matters is how different this is to their presence, and how surely this means no one else will be able to satiate the hunger there bc only they were able to bring fullness.<br><br>and maybe all of this is true. idk. a lot of my own life feels like feeding myself a spoonful i’ll enjoy but from a meal i won’t finish with any sense of satisfaction. i have my anger and my frustrations, and i hate people and love people in moments that don’t always persist beyond that one pocket of time. my memory is horrible. i think often that i live like a ghost. intangible and unreachable. <br><br>but that isn’t always true, and i think i’ve reached a point in life where that’s the thesis holding me together. nothing is ever Always [insert word]. someone on tumblr said that the main lesson of their 20s is that Everything changes beyond recognition. i think that’s true, including your writing. if we stick to the food analogy, do we eat a meal we like and think, darn, i’ll be hungry again later today? or oh, that instant oatmeal was not as good as the fancy pasta last week?<br><br>maybe. i get seeing what’s not there — happiness, fulfillment, improvement — and thinking that gluttony is the answer to such emptiness. but i also think the way we live now is so permanently against a wider backdrop. everything we consume, we want to place somewhere in our internal museum of things. the present tense is attached to “used to” and “could/should be” without any chance at being only itself, ephemeral and forgettable.<br><br>all this to say that i’m biased towards ephemerality bc it’s the only life i’m able to live these days, and i won’t pretend to understand what coming of age in the zeitgeist you belong to is like. but from the way you words things, i wonder if it truly is solitude you have rn and not self-imposed claustrophobia. it’s hard to live with absolutes without feeling suffocated, yet it’s as hard to grow up without absolutes to ground you. i know. but — to say this as mildly as possible — sometimes literature doesn't bring you joy bc you don’t bring joy to it. i think books and writing can feel it when we hate them or want them to be something they never signed up to be. to your question, i have no direct answer except that for me, there’s freedom in "crappy" books and genres i’ll never write. in venturing as far from my own style as possible and feel safe in gorging there. for me, it took years of translating super vulgar latin poetry and reading unedited tumblr novels before i could stomach novels and my own writing again.<br><br>i doubt any of this is helpful, but please know i’m sending you all the warmth and fresh air in the world, literal and metaphorical :(</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! i wanna start reading sss class s*icide hunter and i remembered how much you like it, so i was wondering, would you say reading the manhwa then picking the novel up where the webtoon currently is at is a good idea? or do you think details will be lost? i really, really care about the littlest things, so i figured i'd just start with the novel, but the manhwa looks very Very tempting...</div>

 <div class=reply>the serotonin that Pumps through me whenever i hear someone getting into sh omg… but no, i think the manhwa adapts the novel amazingly, actually! it preserves a lot of gongja’s introspection and in some parts even amplifies the impact of his thoughts and choices — plus picking up the novel after you already have an image of what he’s like in the manhwa is a pro rather than a con, i’ve found. granted, i was a manhwa-first reader myself, so i might be biased towards my particular experience, but i think the manhwa is very much in conversation with the novel and loves gongja and his story just as deeply and earnestly. <br><br>the manhwa → novel transition is also uniquely positioned rn in that the latest manhwa arc is by far its strongest/most involved one so far, and if you read all the way to that Then move to the novel, you’ll just have a small little arc as a breather before jumping into another really strong, big, full-with-so-much-love arc. so. if you ask me, there are virtually no cons to starting with the manhwa and just picking the novel up from there 🤔</div>

 <div class=question>hello, sha! what are your thoughts on isagi/bachira! i've been thinking so much of bachira and audre lorde's "i had come to believe that if i really wanted something badly enough, the very act of my wanting it was an assurance that i would not get it" lately</div>

 <div class=reply>oh this is interesting! i love them dearly as a pair, and i want to say i tried my best to capture my view of their rs in hairpin turns, but i also used to joke on priv that canon isbc are to me like two hs sweethearts who were each other’s first love but went to different colleges and broke up midway through their first year there for no reason except they’re becoming different people. i think they’ll always be a comforting balm to each other, that they ground each other whenever the other runs into danger of flying forward too fast, that they’ll always support each other no matter where they end up. but in some ways they had their time with each other, and yes, they’ll always love each other, they’ll always pick up when the other calls, but there are different things they need from the world and if we really get down to it, those things aren’t really things that the other alone can provide. they’ll always love each other in a special way, but that’s a truth that also means that this same love is the first anchor they need to lift from shore to set sail to who they’re meant to be. <br><br>i always find that when people talk about isbc it’s in direct dismissal of the fact that bachira’s love for isagi in the early blue lock days wasn’t… entirely good for him? either of them, really? they found each other in a setting where you weren’t supposed to find another person to help you and it served them both up until a point, but there’s always been a sense of taking-for-granted that isagi had about anything soccer related prior to u20, bachira included, and a sense of wishful thinking in bachira’s relationship to soccer prior to the 4v4. but bachira let go first. he wasn’t abandoned like he thought, nor did he abandon isagi. i think he just realized how right rin was about him playing a soccer looking for someone, and what a fundamentally different thing that was to truly wanting and going for things. <br><br>so this audre lorde line i’d probably attach to either of the itoshis more. with bachira, i think his desires tend to be so big that the only way he can envision them into reality/fruition is to give them shape Outside of himself. it’s easier for him to invent an ideal of what he wants, the absolute most perfect form of it, and attach that to something external than come to terms with the fact that he wants something big and demanding that he’ll have to work for all by himself. bc that’s so lonely, and he’s tired of wanting and working for things alone. but he got over that by Being the monster he wanted to see in either isagi or rin. i think always about his convo with isagi after he tells him why he chose spain. more than bachira being scared of what he wants, to me it’s more his arc has been realizing that doesn’t need/care for permission or assurance or even any confirmation that he deserves it. he trusts himself to go for it. and i wanna say that’s what he’s doing now while isagi is navigating how to do the same at bm.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello! ahh i never seem to be any good with remembering recs on the spot and also — i’m realizing this only as i type it — i’m afraid i don’t seem to have contemporary lit recs so i apologize if you’re looking for something more slice of life? my most memorable sapphic reads i think have been more in the fantasy/sci-fi/horror/graphic novel genres, so if you’re open to that, these were the first ones to come to mind: the chosen and the beautiful by nghi vo (all her works are mwah but this is a magical realism great gatsby retelling so i’m a bit biased); she who became the sun by shelley parker chan (i believe the sequel is coming out in august so now’s a good time to get into it); on a sunbeam by tillie walden, which is still The soft worldbuilding space opera to me, though i think some people would advocate for her other works (all sapphic) being stronger; laura dean keeps breaking up with me by mariko tamaki is so personal to me but if you ask me why i’m not entirely sure; the horror (?) novels our wives under the sea by julia armfield and paradise rot by jenny hval, both of which i started and enjoyed enough that i stopped reading immediately bc they’re both also short and i have an irrational fear of good things that i can’t draw out for a good while. <br><br>you probably have already checked out more famous titles like this is how you lose the time war and the price of salt. never read either in full, but i’ll throw them into the running anyway since i love the author of the former and like the movie adaptation of the latter. i have a soft spot for devotion by hannah kent and written on the body by jeanette winterson (with whom i otherwise have a rocky relationship) bc i find that their prose in these particular books clears my head when it’s too clogged to write. god i’m sure i am missing So many. i should also maybe say that i’m not typically… a reader of novels on the lighter, fluffier side. not in the pretentious way (or at least i hope not) so much as in the attention span sense. so always take my recs with that in mind. my preferences definitely lean towards more loaded stories/denser prose and sometimes that’s not really synonymous with novels worth recommending in the general sense. but to cap things off, i’ve enjoyed both books by carmen maria machado. her body and other parties is a short story collection with some stronger than others while in the dream house was a tougher read of a memoir but in all the right ways. <br><br>in any case i hope there’s at least one title here you find to be helpful to what you’re looking for :(</div>

 <div class=reply>ah... this seems to be a season of endings for a number of flls readers and each new message like this is making my heart feel more and more like a fist has crushed a half-full soda can in its grip. i’m really, really sorry to hear that — which i know is stupid and inadequate to hear from me, but i really, truly am sorry. <br><br>i think, whenever any kind of relationship reaches a close, there tends to be this instinct to feel personally responsible. like, maybe if i can just not be me, this wouldn’t have happened. but at the same time, i think it’s special when we have someone like that in our life. someone who makes us think: i can be someone else if it means i get to keep you. but that’s not really fair to ourselves. it’s not necessarily right, or even healthy, though it does reflect a certain type of love that hurts all the more to lose. i don’t know. i think we try the best we can at the time. whatever faults we committed or whatever we Are responsible for — knowing that doesn’t ease the grief of going through an ending. <br><br>all this to say that i am squeezing your hand very tight in solidarity. thank you for being so emotionally open to my words in a tiny lil fic, and thank you for taking the time to drop by and write to me despite everything going on. i wish you nothing but peace and gentleness for the remainder of the year.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha. imma be honest with you, it’s been a really really long time since i’ve sent you a cc and i barely remember what i asked and what you answered but whatever it was, the feeling it produced stayed with me. including the amount of work you put into your fics (flls and your bnha and your yoi fics stay with me till this date). i remember that you were really into enneagram at one point and now at my life-draining corporate gig, they made us take the test and when i took the test on my own time without rushing the way i did back during the day - both results were pretty *different* ☠️ shshsjsj ok the point was this they re-introduced the test and a bunch of memories including reading your ccs back in the day of being younger and unmoored as a baby adult brought me back here :3 also what do you think would be the significant difference between identifying as a 3w4 / or 4w3 or 5w4? 😭 i tried the test one too many times after obsessing a little and all three types kinda make sense in their own way now and now im all ‘👀 wtf do i do now’ abt it. p.s. you really don’t have to answer this fr fr (i know you get a lot of cc’s and you keep sifting through them) answer only if you get energy man. take care of yourself. i hope you eat well this yr &lt;3 - sei (also i never gave a name the last time so- lol i figured i’d drop it this time in case i ever send a cc in the future…hmmm. who knows? life has been awfully strange nowadays for me and this is definitely the ongoing effect its having on me lol)</div>

 <div class=reply>i am always into the enneagram! hmmm my gut instinct is to lean towards a heart type for you, just with how you phrased this message — which isn’t to say that any of these things are necessarily markers of any one type. i’m mostly leaning more towards 4w3 &gt; 3w4 bc i assume two different tests gave you those two results? which would make more sense under interrogation than the outlier 5w4. <br><br>but since you’re exploring the enneagram from a workplace environment rn, i’d start with the question of… what do you find draining about this gig? are you putting up with this work in pursuit of some measure of success — success that you find valuable, success that you tie to your sense of self and self-worth, success that you feel will define you for better or for worse? or do you find this gig draining bc a corporate setting does not allow you to feel like an individual, and there’s nothing fulfilling here that will serve you in things like. knowing who you are. what your goals are in life. what will make you happy. god, this sounds like such a rigged litmus test and again none of these things are inherently exclusive to 3w4s or 4w3s but although 3s are a heart type, they actually have less of a prominent rs with their emotions than 4s are. 3s are about values and productivity, about the tasks that will lead to accomplishments and the accomplishments that will lead to a certain image and sense of success. 3s tend to disregard their own feelings in service of that success, whereas 4s would find that career success can ultimately feel impersonal, even inauthentic. 4s are concerned with what feels real and good to them, and when something doesn’t feel that way, they tend to struggle to connect with it. 3s can be focused to a fault, to the point of disregarding all else. 4s tend to lose themselves in an ideal alternative to the current reality. if you feel 4-ish but some of the 3 bits resonated with you, i do think there’s a high chance you’re a 4w3. <br><br>a 5w4 has the same 3 instinct of disregarding emotions, but 5s to me are defined by hunger. some enneagramists call it greed/avarice, but 5s are… hoarders? they’d be in a corporate gig bc it’s hella interesting, or bc it’s a job that allows them to work independently, to keep their circles small. that’s working off a 5 stereotype, but in any case, i’d suggest looking into the instinctual variants of all three types since there are some key differences there too, and 5s most of all. <br><br>my main thought is: all three types would Not make sense for you if you were either 3 or 5. that leaves me to guess that you’re Maybe… a social subtype 4w3? that’s where my instincts are pointing rn — but ofc i have the bare minimum info and i absolutely cannot speak for you. but i hope these help point you in a direction that Can help better :( <br><br>thanks for coming by again, sei. sending u warmth and well wishes with work and beyond, and thank u for your endless kindness to my words 🤍🤍</div>

 <div class=question>Hello, I really hope you won’t take this the wrong way as I really like your writing and you as a person independently from the writing. <br>I have been very confused with my gender identity lately. Like you, I was born biologically female and I go by she/her as of now. When I first checked your account about four months ago or so, I wondered why you went by all pronouns when you present yourself as mostly feminine. Even your Pinterest web weaving is all feminine outfits and hairstyles and… aesthetic? I suppose? Which makes me wonder if I am okay with my pronouns at all, added to that the fact that I am not straight. How did you realize that you’re okay with all pronouns? Is there a difference between their usage and the way you choose to present yourself? Have a great day ahead 🍊♥️</div>

 <div class=reply>no, this is a great question, and i appreciate you being so mindful! <br><br>hmm... this is only my experience, but the way i always talk about both my gender and sexuality is that on one hand it’s All, but on the other hand it’s None. yes, i can feel physical attraction to just about anyone, but i can’t fall in love. yes, i’m fine with all pronouns, but i don’t really feel as though she, he OR they apply to me either. “they” is the most chill, but i’m not Against she or he. there’s a kind of. nebulous middleground there. in high school, i presented mostly as what you might call masculine: short hair, “boy” clothes, "boy" name. i did my time, see if that felt comfortable. it did, but it also didn’t, just as what you are highlighting as “feminine” works now but only Sometimes.<br><br>it’s been much trial and error to even come to the conclusion that it’s both all and none, but i think — and i say this gently — smth you have to internalize vs. the thoughts you outline in this msg is that absolutely nothing about presentation is Inherently gendered. i saw this workshop video where the attendees were asked how they knew they’re the gender they are, only the answer cannot have anything to do with genitalia — and the truth is that if you pursue the thought, the markers we traditionally turn to for “gender” (clothes, hair, etc) are just. arbitrary. nothing labels any of my pinterest stuff as innately feminine except what you have internalized, which in turn is bc someone at some point decided long hair and lace was For The Girls and we just ran with it until it became a norm so concrete that it formed one end of a binary that we just accept without questioning. <br><br>i mean. ofc gender is still an ever shifting process for me. i yearn violently sometimes to just be “masculine” and wish often that i can climb out of a body built like This. but the idea is that gender has been beyond binary-dependent categorization since antiquity, and there’s nothing at all innate to human beings that carries gender innately. not these reproductive machines in our pants, not clothes, not even pronouns. a person can use he/him pronouns and still dress “feminine.” and so. i think moving forward with gender, even if you end up finding you like she/her most, also just means deconstructing the flawed way we tie an abstract concept like gender to markers designed to serve problematic systems. there’s a sociopolitical tangent there, but my point is: it’s your body. whatever helps make you feel like it’s that instead of just something subject to rules that very questionable systems put in place — that’s what your gender is. everything else is whatever you want it to be, with the only caveat being ofc if it compromises your safety.<br><br>but i know this is easier for me to tell you than to internalize, so i can only hope some of this made sense within the word limit. please don’t hesitate to pepper me with questions for clarification any time, and i’m wishing you a great day ahead as well 🥲🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>omg yes !! not a terribly long list, i’m afraid, but i just finished they’re going to love you by meg howrey and it felt very aligned with what i loved about those two novels. not quite as long or multi-generational, but there’s substantial overlap in themes and general… vibes? less so with less by andrew sean greer, but i’ve always thought there’s a sharedness in spirit between it and the heart’s invisible furies. the idiot by elif batuman and its sequel are also very theo decker, and anything by lily king sits in that comfortable corner just a few blocks adjacent to the goldfinch. <br><br>but if you’re looking specifically for something Dummy Thicc and reminiscent of the kind of multi-decade bildungsroman that the goldfinch and the heart’s invisible furies are, i’d look around novels like pachinko by min jin lee, cleopatra and frankenstein by coco mellors, at swim two boys by jamie o’neill, city of girls by elizabeth gilbert, the lessons by ian mcewan, or tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow by gabrielle zevin.</div>

 <div class=reply>i like rilke! i think he’s been flattened a lot in the era of self-help and brain pickings and sites like on being, but in a way i get it bc letters to a young poet is such a titan in conversations around introduction to and love for craft. <br><br>that said, i just tend to favor elegiac poets (my keats and catullus hyperfixation phases went for so long in hs and uni that i’m surprised i still had friends after), so i’m a bit biased towards rilke’s work in that realm. duino elegies was my first proper rilke work, and i don’t think it’s ever been dethroned by any of his others… and like. i guess i gotta lament sometimes how translations seem to not quite fully capture the intensity and packed-ness of the original german, but that’s par for the course with poetry in translation and is probably a shove towards me just sucking it up and finally learning some german. but. my point is. rilke tends to be received as a poet who was a bit capital r Romantic in the keats sense, yet to me he was more what byron wished he was. grittier, more frenetic and tempestuous. translators seem to take the mystical, almost whimsical route with duino elegies in particular — which. not sure how much i agree with that, since there’s definitely glimpses of something… edgier, if not quite jaded either, in rilke’s work. like what midnight mass did with the concept of angels? that really gave off the same vibes as how duino elegies felt to read, in retrospect. <br><br>rambly musings aside: i like rilke just fine. very vibey. very distinct voice. thumbs up.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh goodness i don’t know how many times i’ve answered this question and i don’t even know if my answer remains the same each time either, but… to quote ursula k. le guin, i think love, like bread, has to constantly be remade. i think that when you love someone, you have to constantly, constantly, Constantly make the choice to keep loving them, even as they change, as they grow, as they become a different person from the one you fell in love with. as you learn new things about each other, as strengths become flaws and flaws become strengths, as you experience hardship and successes and all the many, many things in between. there is no such thing as filling up love to the brim the way you can collect other things. it will be from scratch each time — or rather it should be, bc i always think it’s not sustainable to expect love to be complete and stationary. that’s impossible, bc people will never be complete and stationary. <br><br>so i guess when i say that being in love with someone means you’re always at the beginning, what i really mean is that Being A Person means you’re always at the beginning of the person you’re becoming. you’re always growing into someone new, and experiencing new things added to the unique-to-you cocktail of what makes you who you are, and that’s what i mean about the beginning. you’re always coming of age to an age you never were before and never will be again. and when you love someone and they love you, when you love each other in everything that encompasses, you love the very ever-changing nature of love itself, too. that places you in the beginning that both of you are eternally in. you say — i love you now, and i’ll Keep loving you, and this love, we’ll have to keep remaking between us as we become different people. the love will change with us, bc it’s a love that’s worth giving room to grow and change. it’s a love that we can always gift a different beginning bc love is at its purest when it feels like a start between just us. <br><br>you know that one anne carson translation quote that’s like “it’s rotten work” / “not to me. not if it’s you.” i think it’s Bullshit in half the contexts people use it. bc loving someone IS work. who wants to be at the beginning again and again? there’s no winning that shit. but love isn’t a competition or a race or god forbid a checklist. it’s work, and the point is that it isn’t rotten bc it’s them and it’s you and this is the love between you both. the work is the work, but it just comes with loving this person and them loving you back. this constant return to the beginning is just more and more chances at renewing that love and remaking it like bread. <br><br>not sure if this makes sense, and tbf i know i have only an outsider’s perspective on love and the kind of relationship that this quote bookends. it wasn’t even meant to be serious, that advice column opening. it was meant to be goofy and pretentious — but it’s still the thesis of the whole story. so. this is the best i’ve got 😅</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha it may be a little out of the blue but i wanted to say i really enjoy your huckleberry friend newsletter ! i think there’s something extremely comforting in the format, and the february letter in particular found me at a time when i was worried about a number of things. i dont really have much luck with winter, and sometimes i think back to the hardest periods of my life and find that they happened to be around the season. i found myself coming back to your letter a lot during winter this year, and i remember thinking that i had been taking it for granted that i was able to deal with those particular hardships in a season where it isnt strange to bury yourself under the covers and never want to come out. its not winter anymore, and im in a better place mentally than i was at the time, so i just wanted to thank you for providing a lose sense of companionship. im not sure if you know it, but there’s a term in korean that that roughly translates to internal intimacy. 내적친밀감 basically just means feeling a onesided sense of friendship or closeness and as im writing this im realizing its veering close to parasocial, but i promise it isnt really used in serious contexts . at the risk of sounding presumptuous , the bit of you that is able to be percieved through the letters has provided me with that feeling and i cant thank you enough. the cherry blossoms have come and gone, where i live, but the many flowers that are still in bloom have been making my days a little brighter. i hope spring finds you in a similar place of happiness. (also, i’ve started exchanging letters with a friend partly bc of your letters, and its been a delight so far. so thank you that as well!)</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooooh i love that so much… i was kind of familiar with (외)적친밀감 (idk if i’m spelling it right but i remember encountering it in a manhwa? i apologize if it’s wildly off) and it makes sense that (내)적친밀감 would be its inverse… oh i adore that. filing it away in a mental folder immediately. <br><br>and i can definitely empathize with having winter as the backdrop of so many of the hardest periods of life :( i think part of the reason it’s taken me so long to come to terms with being a winter person is that it feels a little like i’m being in love with something that allows me to hold onto pain and suffering to the point of overindulgence, which is absolutely not the person i want to be now and moving forward. but you’re exactly right in how you word it here, too — that sometimes it’s a relief to wither away in a season where Everything is withering away and it’s far too much work to pretend otherwise. i might try again in spring, but for now, i get to be small and cold and cocooned without needing to explain or be anything else. in the enneagram typology system, they have an instinctual variant called the self-preservation subtype, and i think that’s something that winter allows to come naturally, and might even encourage. that preservation and thereby protection of the self, especially if you don’t have the facilities at the moment for anything more than the bare minimum, like the science of hibernation. katherine may has this book called wintering, and i believe she did an episode with the on being podcast as well — neither of which i’ve touched, but there’s value in seeing those wintering periods as a necessary part of life. i won’t say i’ll go that far myself in describing my relationship with winter, but i just value that it asks nothing of anyone, not even definition. during winter, it’s less of a burden to feel like your Self is a burden… in some roundabout way. <br><br>all this to say that it’s really heart-settling to hear that letter not only resonated but also offered even a slight sense of companionship, which i also just think letters are always uniquely positioned to do. i find the format comforting myself, and it has revived my love for letter-writing in other areas, so i’m really just [infinite string of heart and nature emojis] to know it has rippled to something much more real and concrete than how it can feel when i’m typing away on my laptop. <br><br>anyway! thank you for taking the time to send me this lovely message, and to return your sentiment — worded so beautifully that it feels like a little prayer — i hope spring finds you in a similar place of happiness 🤍</div>

GOD. like. listen. i love bachira and isagi’s dynamic. it’s astounding that we have something so unflinchingly and unfailingly healthy in a series that has every attachment style you can imagine. but at the same time i live in perpetual drought of all the other bachira dynamics we can have. i like to think i deserve more bachira and shidou interactions. more nagi and bachira. otoya and bachira? i’ve been onboard the moment i saw them together for the first time in fc barcha. hell, bachira and sae? let’s make that a thing. spanish league subunit. <br><br>i’m giggling at our implication that i pulled rnbc out of thin air like i did half of these dynamics, which is so fair and i forget that i don’t talk about fandom-y stuff on main but. with rnbc, even i get surprised at how dear they are to me. maybe not more dear than rnbcis, but very, very dear nonetheless. i just perpetually do the pepe sylvia routine to my poor priv audience, who i can only hope ignore them as much as i want to believe they do. god. the rnbc thoughts that plague me in the middle of the night. i have an app counter on my phone to keep track of how many times i have genuinely cried over rnbc. i’m holding onto the thematic weight of the rin-bachira-sae-shidou quartet for dear life too, and some nights their canon birthdays give me hope. then i remember we haven’t seen the pxg guys in like. a year. <br><br>but truly, thank god for bachira being such a seamless fit into any dynamic you can imagine. a blessing to all writers. a dream character to fit into any scenario. also thinking about how this one bllk writer has singlehandedly populated the rin/bachira/nagi tag and every time i see them in the rnbc tag i’m like damn. there they go. they have one agenda and one agenda alone. by the time that tag hit 10 works i was just. sincerely blown away by the resilience. the loyalty. the commitment. so much respect to them for knowing the fics they want to see in the world and getting to Work with bachira’s versatility.</div>

 <div class=reply>i name a handful here https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1300765574 and i Think my feelings largely remain unchanged but honestly if i had to pick only one to recommend it’d have to be sss class su*cide/revival hunter. no hesitation, no competition. to be fair i don’t like to advertise the things i like as recommendations necessarily bc like. taste is subjective and i don’t think i should be relied upon for recs about anything. so. take this with a grain of salt as with all things i say. but su*cide hunter has a special place in my heart, and sometimes i do wish someone understood why i go insane every time dear reader by taylor swift plays and spiral about a character from sh. but anyway. before i ramble even more. if there’s really a single single single webtoon to my liking specifically, it’s this one.</div>

 <div class=reply>i do! definitely, i do. i try to be conscious of when i’m not in the best mood for doing replies justice, which happens a lot more than i’d like. sometimes i’m just testy or extra low energy but other nights, like tonight, even though i have the free time, i’m just not. articulate. at all. i’m not making sense in this batch of replies and i can feel it but i’ve also left so many of them unanswered for so long and the guilt is winning. <br><br>so i guess it’s not even that i get tired of answering ccs bc i actually do love all of these so so much; while they’re not too different from the sort of conversations i get pulled to irl, having the anonymous one question one reply element is more freeing than it is restricting. if i have a concern at all, it’s that sometimes i’m just not the right person for these replies, and i feel down and burdened when i can’t do them justice but have no choice but to send off my best. which a lot of the time is hardly even good. there’s guilt there, too, especially since i only have one chance to give a reply and there are moments that another answer will pop into my mind weeks later. <br><br>it’s tricky !! i have to like. psyche myself up before a round of replies. and give myself little incentives and rewards to not put them off bc there are real people on the other end of these messages and i’m grateful they took the time to write to me and i should show that gratitude by. you know. actually replying. then i just do my best and hopefully there’s at least a tiny something that’s worth trusting me with the original message. but it’s definitely always more hope than certainty.</div>

 <div class=reply>i talked about csm here https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1284051338 and here https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1296132191 but ooooh that’s interesting! idk if i have a favourite anything, character or dynamic or whatnot. no hold on that’s a lie i do love aki as an individual and therefore all the dynamics that involve him, from denji &amp; power to even makima, whose general concept and depiction i also love and is one of the main reasons i’m not a big fan of the anime adaptation. <br><br>but yeah, i guess aki is my fav csm character? i’ve never thought about it until this moment but omg the more i type right now the more that love pours out. whoa, have i kept this repressed?? this might be the first time someone has asked me about my fav csm anything 😭 this checks out, though... i love characters with a particular relationship with revenge, the more complicated the better, and all the notes i’m usually wary about in terms of tying vengeance and desire to live to each other, aki managed to cover. there’s also about how… nearly everyone in csm got the ending their storyline deserved, and i’ll always defend aki’s end as a storytelling choice bc his was the most perfect to me. wow i do really love aki, huh. i remember when i first read csm and my friends were expecting me to come out of it depressed and bogged down but i just felt really. invigorated. by it. which is a pattern with fujimoto’s work but that first time with csm, i think i owe primarily to aki’s arc. <br><br>god i’m sorry this is very inarticulate i’m really not in top shape with these replies tonight and i should stop but i will leave you with this far more eloquent and poignant post sjsdks https://nswers.tumblr.com/post/705762659246751745</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t mind at all! but i’m afraid it was a birthday gift around two years ago…? my friends were kind enough to give me multiple copies, and i’ve kinda just shipped some copies to anyone who’s expressed wanting it in the last year or so. i don’t have physical copies left, but i do have the pdf file of the interior if you’d be comfortable dm’ing me so i can send you a link? if that’s something you’re interested in, at least! no worries if not. you could just be asking out of curiosity 😅</div>

 <div class=reply>ON A SCALE OF NO TO YES IS SO CUTE I FEEL SO BAD BUT.

 <div class=reply>i have never. in my life. heard of this anime/manga. so i am so intrigued that you sent me this rec bc i don’t know if it’d have ever found its way to my radar otherwise. i am a bit ???? at the synopsis for the anime but reading the reviews seems promising, and i do love a hidden gem with equally hidden layers. the art also seems unexpectedly delicate and lovely. i’ll see if i can give the manga a shot now that i’m semi caught up with my ongoings 🤔 tysm for dropping by and thinking of me !!</div>

 <div class=question>i know you probably hear this all the time but i just needed to let you know that no fic (or piece of writing in general) has stuck with me as much as flls. it seriously changed my perspective of love and relationships in both a romantic and platonic context in a way that nothing else has. the first time i read it i kept having to take breaks because certain parts felt so deeply personal and forced me to reflect on things i was afraid to admit but once i got through it i couldn’t stop thinking about it and was left with such an immense amount of appreciation for your writing. im on my 4th reread right now and this is super dramatic lol but it never fails to help me feel a little less alone. sorry for the ramble but i hope you have a great april and a great year &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>4TH REREAD? OF THE FULL 100K+ WORDS? oh my goodness ??? that’s an immense honour, it really is, but also — i am both glad that it gives you a reprieve from aloneness and saddened to imagine that to have read it four times, there must have been a number of moments you’ve had to turn to it. i’m sorry to hear that. and none of this is dramatic at all, it’s all free real estate here in my cc inbox, believe me :(<br><br>yk i’ll be honest i’m Still always in disbelief when i hear people talk about flls. sometimes it’s like — are you sure? are you Positive? MY flls? that college au? that little thing i banged out during one of the hardest summers of my life for the last animanga that should have gotten a slice of life au out of me? that one? so if anything i’m really grateful that you took the time to write to me. i guess i tend to lose track of what flls’ appeal for people is, especially bc the irony is that i haven’t and probably will never have the romantic context, experience and perspective that i wrote about in flls. it will always be more personal for other people than it is to me. so it’s easy for me to be like. hm. are you Sure you have the right flls. are you sure This is the fic you want to say all these things about. flls has had such a wide range of readers, and a lot of them have made me feel a bit like flls was the equivalent of a song i made for a tiktok trend, so it’s always just so so Nice to get messages like this and know that at the end of the day there are people to whom flls means something personal. and that’s really all i can ask for as the writer. that the story means something to someone, and that it’s taken on a shape far beyond what i had the ability to give it before i sent it off to the world and into other people’s hands. <br><br>but that is me rambling about my relationship with flls. the bottomline is that i’m eternally grateful to readers like you, and even more for you taking the time to send me a little something 🥹💗</div>

 <div class=question>hi, sha! i don’t know if you’ve been asked this before, but i recently finished reading all the little reflective notes/commentary you’ve posted about your writings and i was just curious if you’d ever do it for your older fics, like your bnha ones? even though i’ve kind of fallen out love with bnha in these recent times, i still really love tddk as a pairing and your fics are some of my favorites! as someone who writes myself, i just love picking apart other writers brains and you provide such interesting insights into your fics and your approach to fic-writing and it’s all very interesting. i think it would be really cool to hear your thoughts about your older fics and the choices you made and the perspective you went into them with now that time has passed!</div>

 <div class=reply>hello hello hello thank you so so much for your kind, kind words 🤍🌷🔅<br><br>and hmmm interesting… i think i joked once about becoming a booktuber except i read and review all the fics i’ve written since i was like. twelve. and another anon said i’d have to do it for my bnha fics, so i’ve considered it a lot here and there since then. i’m definitely open to doing it for my older fics, but my main concern is that… i’ll probably be quite brutal on them? idk how to phrase that without sounding snooty and pretentious about my own work for god’s sake but i do have a lot of impersonal criticism for my bnha fics in particular, yet it also seems to me that across all my cityboys work, the bnha readers have the purest emotional connection with the fics. i imagine it will take a lot of balance and generosity to not infringe on that and make it sound like i’m stepping on fics that means something to others. not to overinflate the worth of my fics, of course, but i guess i just don’t want to trust myself too much to be careful only to end up devaluing a scene or storytelling choice that i may not like now but still has value to someone else. i don’t want it to be personal, but stories Can be personal, and i just don’t want to get it twisted at the expense of someone’s innocent attachment to a work that frankly isn’t even mine anymore. am i making even an iota of sense omg<br><br>also i think i dropped bnha so so So long ago, you know? it didn’t have the following it has now, s1 hasn’t even finished, and so much has happened in the manga that i don’t know for me to accurately judge my own choices and perspective relative to canon characterization and events. that, and my bnha fics are also just. very simple and straightforward. i wonder if i’ll have anything of use to say about them that won’t just be “oh, i see why i did this, but that’s actually Very Not Good. if i was doing this now, i’d try something like…” which honestly would probably be pretty helpful to me, but again. i have doubts and reservations with regards to my own capacity to be a capital w Writer. i think i’m yet to be one. that i’m yet to earn the ability to talk about my old Old work with poise and clearmindedness. or my newer work, actually, so it means a lot to hear that my words were palatable in some way to you despite. thank you, and i really, really appreciate this. <br><br>the tl;dr is that i Have considered it and am continuing to consider it. it’s certainly not an impossibility, and i’m very grateful that there are people who’d be interested. but hey. my fics tend to no longer be mine the moment they’re out there, and i want to stay mindful of not intruding on that after all this time. if that’s not too roundabout of me to say. i hope this made even an iota of sense oh my god i’m sorry</div>

 <div class=question>hi! i hope you’re doing well, sha! this is kind of random, but what are your thoughts on fruits basket? it only came onto my radar last year and i absolutely loved every second of it and i finished re-watching it very recently and i just adore it. not even just the characters and the plot, but the actual narrative itself is handled with so much care from takaya-sensei, you can feel the love she put into the writing. as someone who was mostly entrenched in shounen previously, it made me realize how lacking a lot of character work in shounen can be. anyway! all of this to say, the characters and themes and messaging seem like it would be right up your alley? but i haven’t seen you talk about it before, so i was just curious!</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh you might mean the 2019 fruits basket, which i’m afraid i haven’t touched 😞 i’ve only seen the 2000s one, and i had a high school friend who’d make us watch the whole thing every time her bday comes around… actually, i’m pretty sure i also gave one of my oldest friends the nickname she has bc she really liked kisa when we were growing up and her name is jessica. anyway my irrelevant tangent aside i think it’s generally agreed upon by people who have seen both versions that the 2019 version is far superior so dkjsjs i absolutely cannot speak to the strengths of furuba at its peak and my opinion does NOT count<br><br>it’s really heartening to hear you loved it, though! i think it’s always invigorating when you consume something that’s been done with care not just out of storyteller perfectionism but out of sincere love for characters, and you will always find that one way or another in shoujo, josei and seinen. shounen def tends to prioritize presentation over meat, which tends to mean that often there’s more spectacle than there is enough time spent cultivating certain elements of the story. but shoujo very often has little else to do but spend quality time loving its characters, and i think you see that shine in furuba, which iirc really makes sure no one’s humanity is left unexplored, even the characters positioned maybe as antagonists. it’s required shojo reading for a reason, and to me part of why is how unapologetically but firmly it centers love and gentleness in the face of adversity/harm as being synonymous with resilience. this sense of being able to love someone Through something and ending up on the other side hand-in-hand, bettered by the ways you can make each other more loved. kinder. softer. happier. <br><br>something i also liked about furuba growing up was how it presented love through these small acts of seeing and knowing, which looking back was extra interesting bc it places this limiting element on itself — not being able to touch, or having to hide your feelings and/or relationship — and makes something special out of it. it’s just one of a kind, fruits basket. to be very very honest i can’t recall if i connected with the themes and messaging too much when i was watching it, and i’m not too sure i will now, either, but it really is something special, period. i’m not blind to that at all. i’m so glad it exists. that, and i imagine it’s truly a breath of fresh air after a lot of heavy shounen; it feels like i’m taking that breath with you to hear you talk about having a good time with it, so i’m really grateful you took the time to write to me about it. i also hope you’re doing well 😊💖</div>

 <div class=question>sha!!! i was re-reading and analyzing one of the sonnets i cherish the most and at some point out of nowhere, my brain went ‘holy shit- sha might love reading this’ and unwittingly im now writing this to you. i think you can truly appreciate new knowledge when it comes to literature and overall figured you would find it really interesting - so i just had to let you know that this specific piece of writing exists somewhere out there<br><br>it is called “lethe” (λήθη) and it’s actually written in greek by a writer called lorenzos mavilis. i spent some time digging the net and surprisingly found a translation that actually does the original justice:<br>https://www.translatum.gr/poetry/mavilis.htm<br> <br>basically, according to ancient greek mythology, when a person dies their soul goes to the Underworld, where the spring of “lethe” is located. apparently, those souls get thirsty and drink its water which causes them to experience complete forgetfulness of their past. the poem itself circles around the concept of oblivion, tears and how they thwart the process of forgetting, the bitterness of memories and mourning the dead. there’s a certain melancholy to it, the overall effect being a bit similar to how it feels when a friend is trying to comfort you via phone call after telling them that life recently hasn’t been treating you well but in the end it turns into an one-hour long lecture - which is also what probably made it evoke such an unexpected bittersweet feeling - or rather a joyous sorrow of some sorts? what im trying to say is that it leaves a bit of an aftertaste, kind of like the one unripe quinces have. sweet but sour in a way it makes your mouth dry. hopeful but gut-wrenching. it leaves behind this special weight. it’s difficult to explain. i don’t know. perhaps it’s the mania slowly kicking in.<br><br>it has honestly become a bit of a hobby to ramble about this work. if you ever find the time to read it i really hope you adore it as much as i did. i wish you hopeful days and only heart-warming memories this spring sha 🫶🌱<br><br>rafaela</div>

 <div class=reply>omg i was about to click the link before i even got to your description, but i’m glad i didn’t bc you spin the energy and imagery of the piece so beautifully and it was its own pocket of shared knowing? almost? to have that in mind as i read the actual poem. <br><br>my modern greek is just about nonexistent, so i can’t speak too much as a consumer of only the translation, but it Did make me think… when i was writing this one fic around a month ago i remember wrestling with whether to name a memory erasure experiment lacuna as a nod to one of the characters’ fav movie, but also as a word that in my head showed up as emptied little compartments. not empty but emptied. as in something was there and in its absence, you’re even more aware of the presence that preceded it, OR if i should just call it ameles / lethe, which i thought was on the nose and too universal bc. you know. greek mythology. but in the end i settled for lethe bc of its relationship to αλήθεια (idk how to add breathing marks on keyboard oops) — i believe truth is the same word in modern greek still, just pronounced differently? i hope i’m not talking out of my ass here. but My Point Is: it’s always been interesting to me that by adding the alpha privative to λήθειν — that is to, negate the word for that which has not been hidden/is in plain sight — we get the word for truth. and for λήθη to mean forgetfulness, a single letter away from truth, it’s almost like. without truth, there is oblivion. and yet it’s With the abandoning of the past, we can see more clearly that which is in plain sight. <br><br>god. i hope i’m making sense. your message is so articulate and i’m blabbering all over you. but all this to preface that i wholeheartedly agree with the bittersweetness you highlight, though i also love that there’s almost this sacrosanct quality in how it centers νεράκι / νερό at the heart of each line water is mentioned, which makes sense bc the water of the river is a purifying / erasing element, but also: νεράκι right before στάξει in the next line, and νερό right before mention of the λιβάδι' απ' ασφοδήλι bc water is needed to till the fields even in hell… i love that. you’re right, the poem is overall deeply melancholy, kind of rife with this resignation to reality, but the sweetness for me definitely comes from the use of such simple but deliberate nouns and verbs. no pain that water can’t wash away, water as the element of life and eternity, etc. that’s why the final verse hit me the hardest, i think. weeping on behalf and For the people whom the water of forgetfulness can’t touch. i love it so much. sweet but sour is exactly the word for it. <br><br>thank you so much for thinking of me and sharing this, rafaela. been thinking a lot about lies and memories aiding in comfort, and this gave me even more to chew on. <br><br>i wish you all the sweetness in the world this spring 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i think i managed around five eps? i def want to pick it up again sometime in the future bc the 1998 version was one of my first animes as a kid and i do appreciate how distinct the new one feels… i just don’t think i was in the mood for it when i gave it a shot. didn’t seem fair to a show like that to watch it just to watch it, you know? <br><br>i guess i feel some indiscriminate hesitation towards remakes/continuations of media i hold a lot of nostalgia about from when i watched them in childhood… which i should really do something about. it’s just as unfair bc so many of these new “versions” — trigun stampede, the hxh remake, the furuba remake, the new bleach season, the slam dunk movie — are arguably needed and/or novel improvements upon the original i know, and there’s a lot there i want to enjoy more than i have, and all out of what, some stubbornly irreplaceable nostalgia? there’s bias here that’s just me making it unnecessarily difficult for myself 😅<br><br>but i did like what i’ve seen of trigun stampede! i love what they did with everyone’s designs but especially vash and nai being the anchor of the story right from the opening scene of episode one, and from the talk i’ve heard about the finale, that will only reward me when i do pick up the rest of the season. the animation took me a second to get used to, and i’m not against it so much as i haven’t gotten comfortable with it Yet, but i’ll get there. the colours and music were lovely, and the fresher, more interesting elements of trigun’s sci-fi worldbuilding seem to shine even more with the animation choices made in stampede. so. lots, lots, lots to love. enough that i knew it would be pretty disrespectful if i just Forced myself to watch it. some pieces of media, you have to soak it in when it’s the right time. i have faith that will happen for me sooner rather than later with tristamp, but i sincerely am sorry that i don’t have much for you at the moment :(</div>

 <div class=question>hellooooo sha&lt;3<br>there is absolutely no need to respond to this. i don’t really know the purpose of this message or where it’s going but i just think you would understand me in. whatever this is (&amp; i don’t mean to indulge in parasocial relationships but—!!)<br>anyways, sha. you’ve helped me greatly many times. be it with writing or learning to differentiate loneliness from solitude (i still tell myself solitude should not be a burden multiple times, and i cannot thank you enough for grounding me) and i think i get it now— i inherently have no purpose or obligation and that fact in itself is so freeing, and i will hurt and be hurt, and the whole concept of age, and all the lost hobbies i once swore my life to, i get it. and the past few weeks i have been to museums and cafes and i am doing better not forgetting myself, and i am lighter and less pretentious in my aches, and i’m remembering to live again. but do you also feel, in the moments spent with company, that, somehow, there is something missing? i do not know if i am missing love or missing myself in those moments. <br>i know greed—in this context—is a kind indicator of liveliness, but when it’s for something you don’t even know— i guess it’s just a bit unnerving to think you’ll always be hungry. i don’t know.<br>i know there is only overall happiness and nothing for a fixed entirety. i know everything is momentary except the things that are not, the things we fought hard for, and gradually grew accustomed to even when we promised ourselves we will never take it for granted. <br>i know it’s just the human experience. but sometimes diaries and screaming is not enough. that’s when devotion looks especially appealing to me, when things are not enough. like, i’ll make a fool out of myself to show you my extremities, my promises. is this just boredom talking? or loneliness with a different face? as much as i used to pride myself on self awareness, these days i feel like i’ve got no answers. or justifications. who knows. <br><br>this is so silly. you can laugh it. chalk it all up to another pretentious ache that one day i’ll grow immune to. <br><br>that i’m still clueless. <br><br><br>thanks, sha&lt;3 hope you’re not teasing the brink of insanity these days&lt;33</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, i don’t think this is silly at all. not just in the way i don’t think anything that someone has taken the time to articulate can’t be silly, but i do genuinely believe there’s something meaningful in what you’ve put into words here, and i can’t imagine it can be any more well-put than “i guess it’s just a bit unnerving to think you’ll always be hungry.” <br><br>yeah, it certainly is unnerving. the hunger is an ache. nothing laughable or pretentious about that. i mean. if anything, the way i see it, that hunger, that ache, is what we look for when we seek to define the human condition, you know what i mean? i think — you’re right, in that we will all probably always be hungry. the truth of that doesn’t make it any less unnerving to realize and feel in your gut. that hunger makes us do things — chase after external sources, compact into ourselves, feel reckless and restless — and i can’t speak for people that it has driven to desperation bc i don’t. understand. not truly. but i find it freeing myself, to know there’s no real way to satiate that hunger. maybe that’s bad, but you know i’m a big believer in how, as far as living goes, real knowing is in the not knowing. and i don’t mean we have to be content with not having answers. that’s like telling someone to learn to see starvation as voluntary fasting. but living is to me whatever stops you from dying, and when you live a life privileged enough to be liminal, i think that just looks like… a perpetual awareness that you yearn for life. i think that hunger is what propels us from moment to moment, bc human nature also dictates that we escape hunger. no amount of knowing that’s futile will stop us from wanting. i think the greatest luxury of being creatures who are able to think about ourselves is that there’s no end point. we will always know less than the most we can know. and i think that goes for the joys of life, too. we will always think, what if just—?<br><br>so. yeah. diaries and screaming is not enough. it’s so crazy to be aware of the extent of your existence via a desire so small yet so unshakeable. i always find myself thinking that, too. it’s weird. life is well and truly strange. i don’t love it, but i can always admit it is strange. <br><br>for how little it’s worth, and i really didn’t mean to talk incoherently At you for this much, i’m with you in spirit on that middleground of knowing-not-knowing. thank you for taking the time to write to me with such thoughtfulness. i hope your april treats you kindly, and i’m sending you nothing but warmth and things to fill your days ☀️🪴</div>

 <div class=reply>i gave some fragmentary answers in the other cc (https://curiouscat.me/sleeptowns/post/1308349940) but i also promised you proper novel recs — and at least now i know it’s okay to include darker aspects of it — so here are the first few to come to mind: <br><br>- burnt sugar by avni doshi<br>- hot milk by deborah levy<br>- breast and eggs by mieko kawakami <br>- the lost daughter by elena ferrante (a film recently came out as well)<br>- sharp objects by gillian flynn (and its excellent hbo adaptation) <br><br>also not really about mother-daughter relationships per se but the ~horror novels motherthing by ainslie hogarth and just like home by sarah gallery contain elements that i would say are at least adjacent. i’ve also recently started reading they’re going to love you by meg howrey, and it centers a lot more than the narrator’s relationship with her mother, but so far i’ve found their dynamic quite compelling. <br><br>i hope you are able to find something to like in these (if you have yet to read them, at least) 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you so much ahh that’s very kind !! i... would love to finish my one sdse wip in the same universe as the rnbcis but these two are such a handful (in a good, exhilarating way) that sometimes it’s literally physically taxing to keep writing so who knows if i’ll ever finish. but anyway. <br><br>i did read this one actually! with divine timing too bc i think i happened upon it after learning that shidou’s first name wasn’t ryusei as in shooting star like i thought but ryu as in dragon + sei as in pure/holy, which i should have guessed but also found ironic considering sae calls him his akuma/demon… and so very fallen angel coded. then i saw this fic and was like. the bllk hivemind is real. “i won’t bow to any god but you.” and “my holiest angel, my heavenly god.” changed lives ended careers reversed the earth’s rotation ugh catholic imagery recontextualized in this capacity is always fun but it’s extra fitting for these two</div>

 <div class=reply>this is going to sound like a joke but i… can’t watch it bc i find bojack’s design terrifying. that’s literally it. for a time though my bigger worry was that it will be… triggering? i guess? especially with my own history. i was concerned overall that it will be too nihilistic to be anything but a watch i’ll regret, and there’s nothing i hate more than people delving into nuanced subjects with ultimately un-nuanced portrayals. but i did give it several earnest shots, and i have fav lines from it and know which episodes are my friends’ favs, and now it’s not so much any big reason as it is that i am just. unable. to watch it. if there’s a way to consume it without watching it, i’ll be right there without hesitation, silly as that sounds.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! tonight has been sort of a rough night for me mentally and i found myself wanting to read your recent posts because they always give me a sense of peace and make me feel less alone, and then i wanted to write an ask so i could embrace that feeling. i’ve had this one in the bank for a bit. about a year ago, after reading your jujutsu kaisen fic and sending you some asks and seeing your tweets i felt like you had really good taste, so when i saw you had also written for blue period, i thought: i’ll watch that so i can read the fic. i had only just got back into anime at the time and i never really watched many that didn’t have some sort of action, but i ended up really loving blue period. i watched the entire season pretty quickly, i started reading the manga (something i wasn’t really doing for any anime before) and i asked for physical copies of it for my birthday (along with jjk too which i also have you to thank for) and funnily enough i never ended up reading your fic for it. i hope that’s okay to say, i just ended up getting sidetracked which how much i loved it on it’s own. it’s been awhile, so i don’t really think i could talk too much about it right now, but i know that it means a lot to me, so thank you. i think i’m do for a re-read soon. i’m using all my energy to make this ask a blessing for you to have a good week.</div>

 <div class=reply>i do not have good taste at all! do not ever trust my taste! that part alarmed me so much that i have to lead with this thought! but in all seriousness i always love hearing that people enjoyed blue period, so thank you so much for taking the time to share this with me :( it’s def one of those works that means something different to everyone, and it’s nice to know that innately whenever i hear that someone else has picked it up and connected with it. it’s like ah i’m glad you found something in it. i’m glad there was love waiting there for you. that sort of thing. i owe a lot to the cc anon who nudged me to finally read it after i hesitated over the first volume in my shelf for so long. <br><br>and no omg it’s totally okay not to read my fic! no obligation to that, ever. i’d rather people read whatever is in them to read and when. really, thank you so, so much for your unbelievably kind words about My words, and for putting so much care and labor into writing to me despite the rough night. i hope there have been gentler nights since. i’m wishing you a warm and peaceful spring ahead.</div>

 <div class=reply>not at all! i generally just ignore anything aot, i’d say. i did give the anime a shot when the first season was airing (i.e. i watched an episode), and i’m not totally ignorant of what the story is about and who the characters are, but it’s exactly bc of this that i’m pretty content just writing it off as one of those pieces of media i have zero interest in. mostly, i’m more surprised than anyone at just how well i’ve been able to dodge something so bafflingly beloved. it’s like having noise cancelling headphones on while everyone else is having their ruckus in another corner of the room, so i totally understand why you asked 🤔</div>

 <div class=question>hey sha !! how have you been? what do you think of 2023 so far? my 2023 personally has been kinda awful !! my mental health has dipped terribly, and i go back to school in a week. (my uni is in a city very far from my home town). this will be my fifth and final year of uni and im feeling nauseous because i feel to terribly lonely. i haven't managed to make friends im close to (the type to come over to my house to hangout, of the type to simply go out with). the only one friend i made confessed his romantic feelings for me and we went out for a while, but then i realized that i only liked him as a friend, so i broke up with him. i know it was the right thing, as i know that love comes in many forms and a romantic relationship doesnt necessarily make you feel less lonely. but man i really want to feel close to someone right now!!! its so frustrating bc i feel i failed, all these years of uni ... what does it take to get close to someone? <br>i know this is kind of a self-pitying ramble, but im just so tired !!! i know this may be too selfindulgent, but your fics were what took me out of another emotional dumpster i was a couple of years ago, so i come seeking your wisdom !!! im sorry if this is a weird ask. <br>anyways, thats all. thank u so much for your writing, btw !!!<br><br>thi</div>

 <div class=reply>oh dear god what a year it has been for you, and we’re only how many months in. i’m genuinely very sorry to hear about all this :( <br><br>but no, i completely see where the frustration and loneliness is. though i don’t necessarily think you should beat yourself up for “wasting” all these years in uni, bc i think some things you just don’t know are possible the way they are until it’s happened, if that makes sense. and it’s more normal than not, actually, to not make friends you’re close to. i mean, imagine if we got close to every single friend we make. it’s a nice idea, and i know it’s hard to see people who are really social and not yearn in some way for the closeness we imagine they have with so many people, but it’s still a statistical impossibility. it’s a miracle and a blessing to have close relationships, if anything. that’s what makes them so valuable. but i know hearing that doesn’t make any of this easier to experience.<br><br>you know, what i think is — this is your final year of uni, right? and as cold as this might seem for me to say, you’re about to enter another period of your life with its own ups and downs. people you’ll meet and love and befriend, or maybe a new kind of loneliness, a new kind of obstacle, a new kind of joy, whatever it might be. and having people in uni you’re attached to, a lot of the time, is just more people to lose as you grow up even more. i can’t find a gentler way to put that, but i really don’t mean it meanly. i think people that you meet at liminal stages of your life tend to be the ones to fall off first as you all grow into more concrete people and lives. you can love them all you want, but it’s also one of those… what a miracle it is that our lives ever even overlapped at all moments. some people are lucky to have college friends that last for life, but again, it’s not the expectation, and there’s no pressure on you to have that. i think you’re doing just fine, even if it doesn’t feel like it. none of this is your fault. you certainly didn’t Fail. absolutely not. <br><br>the way i see it, you’re about to finish uni. that’s one hell of an achievement. you made the wise choice and broke up with someone you only liked as a friend instead of staying with him just to have someone. that’s another hell of a thing to be able to do. i don’t know where graduating will take you next, and i really am sorry it’s all bleak and lonely right now. but i have absolute faith that you’re moving forward and i truly do hope there is connection in lots and lots forms in the near future for you. <br><br>i’m wishing you all the best, thi. sending you the sentence equivalent of a tight hug.</div>

 <div class=reply>i am… tired. i think that’s the only opinion i have. at first it was funny in a disbelieving way, a bit like How Did It Get There… then it was sobering bc it became clear How it got there, but now i’m just tired and want the series to end for the sake of the characters and the mangaka and the audience. i’m sorry if that’s heartless to say about a series with characters i still do adore, but it’s terrible witnessing characters and storylines you spent time with struggle on life support it didn’t agree to. i indulged jjk’s flaws while i was writing for it bc that’s exactly the fun of writing — and also i thought it’d be over by now. it isn’t. idk what akutami’s waiting for. they clearly hate writing it. can’t imagine how good the paycheck must be to keep doing this, honestly. <br><br>i think i’m definitely harder on stories these days, and maybe jjk doesn’t deserve so much. but it just gives me a headache to hear about what on earth happened this time. if there’s any emotion that the sukuna megumi thing stirred in me, it’s hope that we’re almost to the end. i just want akutami to let these characters go, and vice versa. i’d have genuine criticisms to say if there was genuine plot happening, but even the story seems to be exhausted. but idk. maybe it’s different for people who are still IN it for jjk. my only opinion is that i think a goodbye should be imminent, if nothing else.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello !! i just saw your later cc but to make up for my lateness i’ll (try to) see if i can answer both… i really am so sorry 😞<br><br>the first thing to come to mind was the anthology what my mother and i don't talk about. it’s edited by michele filgate, but it features a lot of renowned writers from alexander chee to carmen maria machado. the second thing to come to mind was the mother’s day episode of this american life: https://www.thisamericanlife.org/159/transcript. there’s also this story, which was featured on longreads when it was still on medium but i’m only able to find now via this site: https://mymothersworld.com/ (i don’t quite remember what i thought of it, but it’s still worth checking out) and there’s a poem called “mother” by erica jong, and the context is a bit messy and a lot of things come up when you look up erica jong as both mother and daughter, but this is a link to the poem: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/mother-365/ <br><br>which reminds me of the movie mommie dearest (which i hear is hilariously bad for people with no experience with parents like this but is ironically quite realistic for those who do), and i distinctly remember watching a video essay on it from the channel be kind rewind but can’t seem to find it. here is a great substitute: https://youtu.be/nCi19sYugIA (i also recommend looking into the background and history of this movie and what it's based on if you'd be interested in some complicated real life mother daughter relationships) <br><br>i realize none of these are particularly happy, but i hope there are blinks of joy in the anthology and in the this american life episode. i’ll give you some novel recs in my next answer, i promise!</div>

 <div class=reply>i absolutely did not know !! like it’s hilarious how many times i’ve drastically changed my path in life. i was changing what i intended to do with my degree up until graduation, only to swerve and end up in something i never even studied. personally i think knowing who you are from the very beginning and doing everything right to fulfill that vision is a myth. a scam. bc not knowing can be a good thing. <br><br>i approached my education with full awareness that i’m not bound to whatever i choose on paper, so i didn’t really choose my classes with any thoughts except oh this one sounds cool. when i didn’t think anything sounded cool that term, i just picked the one i thought i’d do well in without trying too hard. which. i know how that sounds. i wish i could tell you that there’s a way to maximize your time in school such that every class you take will be fulfilling and life-changing. and i Did have fulfilling classes. but they were the minority, and i don’t do anything with them in my current jobs. so if nothing is calling to you, i don’t think there’s shame in just picking the ones that are compatible with how you study or attend (or not attend) classes. my diploma remembers that i’m summa cum laude, not that i took a polisci class one term bc the only evaluation was a big paper. it’s only an added plus that i still think back to what i learned from that class. pick classes you’re likelier to go to. i was a serial class skipper, but i always enjoyed the classes i went to regularly. if you’re not passionate about a class, pick one with a prof who is. some classes i picked bc a friend was in it. some classes i picked bc i was likelier to go to a 2pm class than an 8am one. whatever major that amounts to, then that’s the one. <br><br>i only picked my degrees bc i liked latin. that’s it. in some ways, i put up with the parts i didn’t like bc i already chose. that’s all it takes sometimes. not really any kind of bone deep knowing or passion. sometimes the vaguest curiosity is all you have, and there are ways for that to be enough.<br><br>however: just bc you can switch doesn’t mean you should, and just bc something is difficult at first also doesn’t mean you should drop it immediately. uni is hard to figure out bc it’s all intuition but people tell you it’s life-dictating. but whatever stops you from giving up on education you deserve IS the education you get. whatever you have to romanticize, however you have to strategize — that’s the stuff that will equip you for life, not the fine letters on the degree you get in the end. <br><br>my baseline note is that it’s okay to not know, but not knowing is not an excuse for not doing. there’s a middleground there that gives you all the room to work with, and don’t let anyone tell you it’s not enough to be in that in-between spot.</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha! happy march! i have been wondering -- do you have any advice on how to make friends for someone who spends most their time stuck in their head and doesn't really like people all that much? and how to keep those friends when self-imposed exile grows longer than socially appropriate? and maybe how to balance the desire for solitude with the craving for genuine human connection? your fics and newsletters embody this feeling that you've somehow found the perfect balance between the two, and of course the tailored words you post for others every once in a while don't reflect your reality, (and maybe i'm projecting), but even so any insight you have to offer would be properly appreciated and cherished. thank you &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>oh it has been so long since i responded to ccs that it is almost april. this is mortifying. i am so sorry. and to such a thoughtfully crafted message, too. thank you so much for taking the time to write to me with such care and intention :( <br><br>hmm… this is a hard question, bc i think human connection is one of those things that we can’t truly be objective about. if we don’t have enough of it, it’s easy to tell yourself you chose that, and if we have too much, it’s easy to say we’ll be just fine without it. but every case is different, right? we can prefer being alone at a movie theatre but still want someone to hold our hand before we get a flu shot. and i think when people imagine being fine with solitude, what they truly imagine is independence, which always ends up being trickier. <br><br>only speaking for myself, i’m an adult with adult friends who have their own lives, and that’s a different framework of social expectations. nearly all my friends i see in person once every few months, and i’m also not very good at sending short frequent messages. it only works bc my friends have their own partners, or live in other countries, or have research papers and jobs to keep them busy. i’m more of the friend people come to see when they want a pause, which also means people only need me when they need that pause. but something that’s worked for me i think is just… to be generous with what you Are able to give. you don’t have to like or love every single person you meet, but you Can be present when you Are with another person. i get being stuck in your head, and i know it’s tiring to be around people, but i also know i can always recharge and go at the rest at my own pace. if i’m hanging out with someone, it usually lasts the whole day. if i’m replying to a message i’m late to, i hope it’s in a way that allows the conversation room to continue (though i’m also guilty of giving people room not to have to reply) or at least affirms that i understand their thoughts and am all ears. physical exile doesn’t have to be emotional exile. sometimes a “this made me think of you” goes a long way, and that’s smth you only learn to collect bc you’re present with people. i think genuine human connection isn’t picky about its environment. i don’t know if it’s enough, but the people i do love — i want them to know. i can’t offer much, but very often, people need less than you think. and also, it’s okay to take your time finding your people! definitely don’t shut yourself away from the world, but you also don’t have to put up with people who don’t respect certain boundaries just to Have people. <br><br>i realize none of this is very helpful as i’m rereading it, but i think my only point is quality over quantity, and to surround yourself with people for whom this is also true.</div>

 <div class=reply>i got to this message while my housemate was sitting next to me and we both gasped and agreed that this is one hell of an honour to hear. like. my god. i’m done. i’m closing up my inbox. this is peak. <br><br>but all (sincere) joking aside, i love adrianne lenker and big thief! masterpiece is possibly one of my fav albums, and her solo output in particular has its spot in my personal hall of fame bc her discography is this fascinating balance between rich imagery and a slew of deliberate verbs sung with even more deliberation. so many of her songs are mid-motion, mid-action, mid-moment. yet the production of the songs themselves feel grounded, and never like it’s doing too much or too little. it’s to the point, but the point is never dull. it’s really, really nice. i like her style a lot, so again, i’m truly beyond honoured that her lyricism could at all loop towards me 😞</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! i hope this ask finds you well &lt;3 i was reading your ode to winter and it really settled some restless thing inside me, i don’t know, it was just so beautiful and i thought about it all of today when i was walking outside in the cold. it made me think of loneliness and alone-ness and being content with yourself without want of someone else to fill that gap and i just. was wondering how you do it. if it’s natural for you to find peace in doing and living by yourself, if you’ve always found comfort in solitude, if you’ve ever been so lonely the comfort of being alone starts to lose its warmth. i don’t really know how to word this, but i’ve always thought of myself as a solitary creature, someone who would rather do things alone, but i’ve realized it’s not that i’d rather do things alone but that it’s just easier for me to exist alone. have you ever experienced that feeling? sorry for this ramble i’m not sure where i was going with it. i’ve been thinking to myself all day that i need to ask you this burning question and now that i’m here i’ve forgotten how to ask it. thank you for reading till here, you don’t have to respond of course, i hope you have a lovely rest of your day &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my goodness what a lovely message… thank you for taking the time to read the newsletter and write to me :( <br><br>and no, i think you ask some really good questions. it’s not straightforward, definitely. there isn’t much out there to acknowledge people for whom solitude is the very thing that brings what is brought to others by having company. there’s no easy way for me to tell if i’m someone who has always loved being alone or if it’s something that naturally came about bc of [waves hand] factors in my life. but there’s that louise gluck quote, about remembering one’s childhood as a long wish to be elsewhere, and i always thought that i remember mine as a long wish to be left alone. the same even now. if ever i found alone-ness sad, or lonely, i don’t think it was ever by virtue of being alone. it might have been bc i had nothing to fill my life with, nothing to feel anything over, or maybe there is too much i’m feeling and i’m all alone with it — but i don’t think alone-ness itself is the Cause of any of these. and that’s a crucial distinction to me. needing people so you’re not alone with yourself at the end of the day is not the same as wanting people as yourself. it delays the necessity of reckoning with who you are and the parts of you that you don’t want to be alone with, but it doesn’t erase it. so i think i just tend to be skeptical about what people advertise about the pros of being around others all the time. <br><br>i mean, i know this isn’t really a good answer, but to me, as long as solitude is a means of loving yourself and embracing your needs and not an excuse to deny yourself love bc at least being alone means you won’t have to be forced into vulnerability — then that’s all anyone can ask for from the things you keep around to bring you comfort. i find that it’s much cleaner, too, to ask for something like that from a state of being rather than from others. some people talk about their friends or significant others or pets or Kids like they’re meant to be tools to solve the human condition for them. but you can’t subtract something in your life by adding. you subtract by subtracting. you add by adding. i don’t think it has to be more complicated than that. sometimes something feels natural for no other reason than it asks nothing of you. i think a lot of us could do with a lot more of that in this world, and if solitude is that thing for someone, then far be it from me to discourage it. <br><br>sorry for the roundabout answer ahh i hope you have a wonderful week ahead, and thank you for such a gently articulated and thoughtful message</div>

 <div class=reply>oh that is so so sweet to hear !!! i’m glad you found your way to gracie abrams !! <br><br>though hnnn i don’t think i have any strong feelings about it, necessarily… which is kind of a strong feeling in itself, possibly. i’ve only listened to the full album in one go once when it first came out, and nothing really jumped out and punched me in the face. i think a part of me is disappointed, and the other part is trying not to be bc that means i had expectations, which i didn’t even realize i did bc i love gracie but i doubt it was to the point of expecting a full length album to knock me off my seat. disappointment feels unfair of me. <br><br>what i can say, though, is that… the problem with this album is that it takes all the parts that are usually so good and heartfelt about gracie’s music — the confessionality of her lyrics, the nuance of the dynamics she paints in these relationships, the gentleness of her whisper singing — and flattens them until they’re worth next to nothing. it’s not terrible, bc those good qualities are still there, but it is very stationary, and that makes it repetitive and empty when you’ve got twelve tracks in the album that could have been swapped out for each other. the strong and intimate moments lose their strength and intimacy when the whole thing is one big neutral chunk, and i think it would be different if there was any sort of momentum or direction or even just one slight peak in the writing or the singing or the production. but everything stayed at the baseline. it got quite tedious, and the lyrics also started losing the ability to hit hard bc some metaphors are like… first draft similes? i feel like when you write about personal things, it’s always better to go more specific than be universal and risk not only ubiquity but softening the impact of your own confessionality. the same with production. mixing and production can do so, so much, so i’m also surprised to know aaron dessner did most of the production. i think the haziness of gracie’s voice is well-preserved, but its emotional weight became invisible about halfway through. it’s just. an album that could be and should have been more. is what i think. <br><br>but if i had to pick a fav part of the album, i’d maybe choose the final three songs? right now was the only song to make me go oh that’s pretty nice, and i think that’s worth a lot considering it’s the very last in an hour’s worth of much the same vibe. if i listen to those final three now by themselves, i think i’d quite like them, but right now seems a good balance of all the best this album has to offer. idk. all of this is subject to change, as always. i def need at least one more listen to have an opinion worth someone’s time. <br><br>in any case tysm for thinking of me and i also hope you are doing well 🌟</div>

 <div class=reply>this could not be more vague and i have no idea what the specific context for this could possibly be but for what it’s worth no i don’t think so 🤔 i’m not a big believer in purpose — which isn’t to say i don’t think things should have purpose! i do have strong feelings about what’s necessary and what isn’t, but my general feelings about requiring purpose to live is… meh. bleh. <br><br>i guess i’ve never really thought about it. or if i have, i must not have found any of the answers i was offered worth ruminating over for too long. it’s useless to me, purpose, and i don’t mean that snidely or derogatorily, i promise! i just mean that i have no use for it, literally. i don’t start writing something intent that the end result fulfills some sort of purpose and only that, and i think i live life with much the same approach. i do reflect and examine and weigh options as i go along, but purpose as a concept is just a big why in my head right now. it does sometimes concern me when people get too bogged down about stuff like that, bc there’s always something they end up neglecting. it’s like how i see writers plan and plan and plan and never actually write anything. or maybe they talk about the big themes they want to explore, the big things they can do, but you read the result and you see the more it could be but it just… isn’t that. bc they stuck stubbornly to the plan or got too caught up making the notion page pretty and packed or was too sure of what they’re capable of to leave room for experimentation. that makes me sad, especially bc these people work harder than i have in my writing and deserve more in their output. <br><br>seeing people live life that way is much the same. that’s really all i mean about not believing in purpose. it’s good if you have it, and of course of course of Course it’s valuable to have. but as for me, purpose has never really earned or demanded a place in who i am and how i operate. for all that i like to make fun of my life, i’m not totally blind to having specs — or however you wanna call education and career and portfolio or whatever — that anchor my life into what others consider to be achievements. so. i acknowledge i’m plenty spoiled by how i’ve been able to get to where i am by just going with the flow, to wherever life takes me next. i just happen to have the luxury of ignoring and discarding what i don’t find interesting or necessary, but a luxury is a luxury. in the end, i probably shouldn’t speak on what i’m lucky enough to not find important.</div>

 <div class=reply>THIS MADE ME GIGGLE first of all thank you very, very much for the kind sentiments, but second, i do just tweet whatever though! i Have used a fancier pfp or a nice poetry quote as my header in the past but shuddered at it eventually bc it’s so. non-casual. when my tweets are very much the opposite. i have mutuals who are much more artist-minded than i am. i have literal Poets as mutuals. but i most definitely am not one and have no interest playing at being some kind of capital r romantic artist. <br><br>idk. if people are turned away bc they assume a pinterest-y pfp means thoughts with no substance — sounds like an exclusively them problem, tbh. like i keep turning that thought around to check for what part of it is my business to worry about, but i just can’t find any angle that makes it so. people are so concerned with having icons and posts that are super in line with what aesthetic they want to reflect, but gosh, what a bother it would be for me to worry about whether i’m adhering to a particular look. i use this or that pic bc i think it’s minimal looking and plain enough to not be all up in my face, but more likely bc i suddenly got sick of the one i had and just picked the first simple one to catch my eye somewhere. otherwise, i tweet my tweets and peace out soon after. they speak for themselves however they do.<br><br>above all it ultimately doesn’t matter if people follow me or not. it’s baffling to think it would. what bearing would it have on my life or my thoughts if someone is turned away from my account? would it stop me from eating or sleeping? if a tweet gets no likes, would it make the thought i articulated un-happen? no to all of the above. do i tweet and expect ah sha you are such a Serious Hardcore Thinker, you should have Legions of followers who worship at the vermeer painting you have as your pfp? god — imagine. i’m laughing again just thinking about it. no one would expect me to be a cult leader. i don’t even rt or have a name or a bio bc it’s all too much of a bother. somehow people find their way to me, and i’m thankful as is. some miscellanea i just find unnecessary to maintain, and in this particular case, i just hate when things are taken too seriously and/or decidedly. that includes myself. the ultimatums of social media is what i find corny. reminds me of academia. it’s often the elitist ones that concern themselves too much with flaunting social and cultural capital that you’ll discover to be hollow and not very interesting once you get into actual discussion. it’s disappointing. and so un-fun to fall into the trap of participating in.<br><br>i’m sincerely grateful you’d think my words would be worth more than what you perceive to be lacking 🤍 but i just — don’t, personally. or rather, the worth isn’t worth poring over and externalizing for other people’s sake. but thank you, really.</div>

 <div class=reply>hi hi so sorry for the delay in answering ccs and i also hope you’re doing well !! i’m just not too sure i have recs that perfectly fit the bill, though it is an interesting point to think about and i wish i had more to offer… i know rené girard must have written a bit on the imagery of blood, just that it’s def more on the sacrificial/religious side. there’s also aspasia stephanou’s inhuman materiality in gothic media, which again has its own genre lens and isn’t quite about the eroticisim/intimacy of blood specifically, but it offers some nice points on it. <br><br>ahhhh the thing is i think it’d be difficult to find something on a subject this broad without another specific marker associated with the blood — could be the eroticism/intimacy of blood in the aftermath of violence, for example, or the eroticism/intimacy of the consumption/exchange/offering of blood, of which i’m sure there are quite a few written. if you know what you’re looking for, or if you’re not looking for anything specific and just want to see what’s out there, i think there’s no harm in looking into subgenres first and hopping around from there. i’m sure papers on vampire folklore and literature have a lot to say about the erotic qualities of blood, or there must be studies on catholicism’s practice of making mass-goers drink the “blood” of christ. it doesn’t have to be your endgame reading, but sometimes it’s nice to read more specific theses and visit the citations/footnotes of any points that might be closer to what i need, if that makes sense :(</div>

 <div class=question>I SWEAR I HAD A DREAM ABOUT A CERTAIN CROWNED PRINCE RIN falling for Isagi who happens to be of lower status. so naturally I hopped on ao3 and looked for fics that might fit what I’m looking for but there’s none. then I hopped on here just to ask if it ever crossed your mind but i scrolled a bit in your recent cc’s and read that YES, IN FACT IT DID and honestly if you ever decide to write a royalty au one of the itoshi brothers is a perfect fit. The way you worded sae and shido’s dynamic - i agree, i think sae would be a perfect PERFECT prince. you’re so amazing i want to scream about it</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my god i saw this while having a semi ryusae meltdown on priv and i thought to myself: holy shit?? i’ve always believed my bllk cc visitors are lowkey telepathic and this proves it??<br><br>but no there really is so much potential in an itoshi brothers royalty au !! a rin who’s unexpectedly made crown prince would further spike his complicated bag of feelings towards sae in canon… though sae has a remarkable compatibility with the kind of character who’s been raised to be king — calm, impenetrable, the kind of presence the room falls silent for, vicious and efficient in both words and actions — whereas rin has all the pitfalls of being the younger brother to such a person, unable to quite shake off his hero worship, not seeming to realize that his very need to surpass his brother also positions sae on an unreachable pedestal by default. sae has already been broken in by the world, and it’s made him cold towards hints of vulnerability, while rin just oooooooozes a need for approval. there’s a bleeding heart-ness to him that would make an interesting combination with having to suddenly assume sae’s role as crown prince, a mix of determination to do better than sae yet a sense of. why did you leave me with the weight You were supposed to carry, you shitty older brother. add to that the fact that i think canon post-spain sae actually thought he was doing rin a favour by doing a 360 on him. a way to teach rin the ways of the world bc at least he’ll find out from him first, and that’s his responsibility as an older brother that spoiled rin enough that he’s helpless without sae’s guidance. <br><br>THAT SAID i prob lightly touched upon some of these in hairpin turns, but just to consider all my possibilities, i fear canon rinsagi doesn’t give me much to work with right now in terms of a whole au… yet somehow rinbachi would be made for it? smth about a rin trying his best to be cool headed and indestructible like sae, then in comes bachira — who insists rin should have Fun between his boring administrative work, who’s perfectly made for royal etiquette as much as he is capable of shunning it, who comes out of lessons with his tutors with sleeves stained with ink and knows all the palace staff by name and is so desperate to love and be loved (see: rin’s need for approval) in a place where family has always meant duty first.<br><br>and smth similar in ryusae, where the prim and proper crown prince is rumoured to have a batshit insane right hand man orbiting him, and people can talk all they want, each new story more drastic than the last, but only sae knows that shidou is as loyal as he is unpredictable and equally vicious and never Ever too far from where sae needs him to be, and it’s the closest reprieve there is from the monotony of royal responsibility. <br><br>i feel on the verge of mania actually god sorry for rambling but tysm for this moment of telepathy and for your kind words 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>hmm there is no other life for me except one where i write :) i’m on record saying i could be stuck in a deserted island and it wouldn’t matter whether i had food and shelter if i couldn’t at least find a way to carve words against tree bark to get as close as i can to writing. and i did mean it. it’s out of the question to not write. i will die. not hyperbolically. literally. it’s not even a matter of me living and breathing writing day in or day out. it’s like having a consciousness inside of you, so intrinsic and indelible that you’ll feel halved if you lost it. even in a life where i’m a chemist or a dancer or a hitman or a politician — i don’t there will be a relationship with any of those fields without writing of some kind. sometimes it feels like writing isn’t even a craft i chose or a tool i use. it’s not even something i live for the way you might for life’s small joys, or something i need to live in the same way you need food. i’d already be functionally dead the moment i have to choose writing to have it.<br><br>god anyway that sounded too intense and pretentious for the tone of your cc yikes i’m so sorry one of my housemates jokes that whenever i talk about writing i sound like a sports anime mc monologue so feel free to laugh at it too :( i bastardize writing too often myself to be so serious and earnest about it honestly <br><br>and hey, listen, i think reading in your 20s is different from reading in your childhood — which is def useful when it comes to fostering a lifelong love for it, but the things you take away and the things you even like to read and why are completely different with a 20-something brain. even things you read and liked as a kid, you’d interpret now in ways you wouldn’t have the facilities to back then, and like you said, it’s better than never. so i don’t think you should beat yourself up too much about not reading endlessly in childhood !! the world is infinite, and so are the stories in it, and that will never change no matter what age you start consuming those stories. <br><br>all This to say thank you so much for your kind, kind message !!! sorry for getting unnecessarily serious on you, i hope you’re taking care as well, and i’m cheering you on in all your reading and more 💛</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s not strange at all — and in fact got me to tear up a little. i can’t think of any other colour association that will move me more than this one did, and not just bc blues are my fav colour family, or bc i like winter and the sea, though all of that plays a part 🤔 i think it’s the range of shades part that really got me; something about being able to move through the gradient and for that to come across to readers is really special to hear. so thank you so, so much for sharing this with me.</div>

 <div class=reply>hi!! aha hmmm… hmm…. to be perfectly honest… i wouldn’t recommend it? i can maybe say it’s worth reading insofar as it offers some cool trains of thought about the ways that mary shelley’s frankenstein remains relevant and significant as we move forward with today’s technology and continue to have increasingly nuanced conversations around artificial intelligence and really just artificial life and what we consider “anatomy” / which organic parts of our lives you consider to be against question, but as with most of jeanette winterson’s work, the execution is questionable in the very act of — executing, i guess. i think her prose is consistently beautiful in its own way, and whenever i feel stuck and unable to produce my own voice, i read a few passages from some of her other, more palatable books to kind of wet the ink, but she just. does not know how to write longform. not that i have any authority to say that. i’ve read some of her shorter work + her small nonfiction pieces and they have been much stronger, yet her novels have this tendency to prioritize a kind of personal conceit, and it just feels very much like the author is looming over me waiting to choke me out if i dare criticize what the book is arguing for — and not in a good way. whatever cool thoughts frankisstein offers are also just… not entirely novel or creative, and a few are resolved in a way that leave a sour aftertaste. again, not in a good way. <br><br>i Am a little conflicted bc her approach to retellings is most def still better than a lot in the market rn, and again, her style is popular in writing circles for a reason. but. i mostly included frankisstein in flls bc megumi is implied to get the rec from mahito’s newsletter, and it seems exactly like the sort of thing that someone with mahito’s tendency to hollowly philosophize would like (derogatory). i do like the stylistic beauty of the particular snippet i included in chapter 4, especially as it highlights megumi’s relationship with words and what we’ll see is an inability to Express his love to yuuji in the right language, and so he must borrow them in this case from a book he didn’t even discover himself — but i don’t have a lot of kindness to spare for the novel itself, unfortunately. ofc anyone is free to pick up the book and like it if it’s up their alley! it just wasn’t for me, and i can’t rec it with a clean conscience 😞<br><br>p.s. thank you so much for rereading flls and for wanting my thoughts on frankisstein !!</div>

 <div class=reply>easily my fav song from nj !! really the only one to hold me attentive to it, but that’s prob to be expected. it’s funny bc i don’t usually watch mvs, but i thought i saw choi hyunwook (who plays a lead character on one of my fav shows from last year) in one of the gifsets circling around and i was like… ariana… what are you doing here… my point is i watched it totally not expecting what i’d find and now i can safely say that this is a huge, huge honour, so thank you so much 🥺<br><br>as for my thoughts on the song / mv in themselves, i do kind of lament seeing the choreo bc it changed the vibe of the song completely for me? the title of the song is so reminiscent of the movie 동감 from the 2000s, which was like. old school kimi no na wa. and i always love a good Were They Even Real twist in kpop mvs. but what felt melancholy and haunting in the song at my first few listens just seemed cheerful in the choreo, and ofc that’s perfectly fine, i just wish i didn’t see it and now have the image of the dance in my head when i hear the song. i personally find the cohesion of this comeback messier than nj’s debut, though i think i just have a bone to pick with how kpop tends to aestheticize the Coolest imagery in their teaser concepts and then drop an mv and overarching comeback concept that is so. expected. by comparison. i wish groups leaned into the aesthetics and styling that they started the era with. if ditto had been the title track for promotions instead and the dance had been more chair-based / b-side esque or at least consistent with the coming of age vibes of the ditto mv taken straight out of ea coming of age films from the 2000s — that would have felt much more novel to me than what omg ended up being, i think. <br><br>there’s nothing wrong with kpop being… pop, but i do have a pet peeve insofar as so many groups try to market concepts that aren’t emblematic of the industry’s wider discography then end up defaulting to that with the actual title track in the end. i just really thought nj will have more of that bittersweet, nostalgic essence to this comeback, but now i’ve mostly reverted to an “ah… of course. that’s fair.” feeling. i do still like to listen to ditto and concoct my own vibes for it bc. that’s how music works. i know that. i’m not trying to criticize kpop for being kpop. but just felt like that was a necessary caveat to my love for the mv, which is to say that i liked the mv so much (and am therefore so moved by your comparison!) that i’m pretty disappointed we don’t have more of the vibes we thought we were getting when it first dropped.</div>

 <div class=question>Hello sha! It seems like you experimented with multiple aus across many fandoms and I was wondering if you ever considered writing a royality/kingdom au? Also, I’ve read five fics of yours and it’s abundantly clear how much love you’ve poured for hairpin turns alone like, you can tell that you’ve had the time of your life writing it. And so, will you be writing for Blue Lock again? I hope you’re staying warm!</div>

 <div class=reply>there’s actually a royalty/kingdom au for jjk somewhere… but it wasn’t very substantial, to be fair. i’m not the most attached to settings any older than the ~modern era, whether reading / watching or writing — but i do like modern royalty !! one of my dream fics to write is an au based on the kdrama goong, but there hasn’t really been a pairing that i’ve found perfect for it. i considered one for orv, but i’m not attached to any of its dynamics in a way that doesn’t simplify itself in the end. so many characters i’ve loved recently are crown prince types, yet i feel like i’m still waiting for the moment that a dynamic drops into my lap and it clicks that it’s time.<br><br>(although — as i write that and as i reread your cc, i do think either of the itoshi brothers would make a perfect burdened prince. but ahhhhh idk i want to write bachisagi but also to write rinbachisagi again in a modern setting but also a rin made crown prince after sae abandons his post as heir for Reasons but the thought of perfect prince sae having to make space in his life for shidou, who cannot be more of an antithesis to royal perfection — i’m on my knees banging a fist against the ground and that’s barely hyperbole. not to mention the hairpin turns world tempts me to return sometimes, with all its background dynamics. but that much is not new with any of my fics.)<br><br>all this to say the itch / urge to write for bllk again is very much there. thank you so much for saying this about hairpin turns — i smiled so wide when i read your cc, it really means a lot !! i might have already said this somewhere, but there’s something in hearing kindness about hairpin turns come from someone who’s read more than one or two fics from me that just moves me differently. i think a part of me is like — would someone be able to notice what i felt writing this? would anyone be able to tell how different this one feels from the ones before it even though technically the rest are my usual tastes? i know what i say about readers not really knowing writers just bc of one work, but there’s a sense of trust and connection i especially feel towards people who have read a few fics from me and kind of… know my work, in that sense. so thank you so, so, So much for reading five (!!) of my fics, and for being so thoughtful in sending me this about hairpin turns. i Did have lots of fun with that fic, the kind of fun i can still feel thrumming in my hands every time i think about it, and i’m incredibly delighted and touched to know it came across to at least one reader. <br><br>anyway. i’m sorry for rambling at you. i got super giddy and excited, but i really do mean it. tysm — and we’ll see about another bllk fic. it’s def not an impossibility. i also hope you are staying warm 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>hello !! honestly, i finished hairpin turns and was sure that’s all i’ve got for blue lock, but lately i’ve been wrestling with the temptation to write for it again — so i have no idea what to do right now 😓 <br><br>it’s not impossible, though, for sure! i had a lot of fun writing the sci fi au, and there still has to be more to chew on. but all i have to offer rn is… we will see.</div>

 <div class=reply>i actually have not! it’s the only one of the shounen big three that i didn’t do time with at all, oddly enough. it’s not even a case where i gave it a shot and just didn’t like it. i don’t think i’ve ever seen a whole episode, and it’s never been on my agenda to. i guess i just wrote it off quite early in life as something not quite for me? or maybe just something that was for my friends and others more than it was for me. <br><br>see, this is an interesting question, but please remember that i do have a limited scope of how to answer in specific relation to naruto! my main thing is that i feel conflicted between my belief that anything queer people can read queerness on is queer coded enough bc of that dynamic alone; i think a thing needs little else to be queer than for queer folks to interpret queerness based on what it has given them. someone brought up this point of how the horror movie with the megan doll had unintentionally resonated with a queer demographic more so than billy eichner’s movie bros, which was marketed to be upfront about being a queer story — and there’s an intriguing thought there about what sort of “queer coded” markers queer viewers will actually connect with. with that in mind, i think the classic friends-rivals narrative in naruto (and to be fair narusasu is quite the emblem of that, even amidst hundreds of others in pop culture) is queer coded purely bc a queer demographic has decided that this kind of dynamic reflects elements that we claim. full stop. that’s it. i think there’s enough validity in that. <br><br>at the same time… shipping comes in all forms, right? resonance is on one end of the spectrum while fetishization is on the other. but there’s a wide middle there, and to me that means that a piece of media offering up the potential for shipping culture’s taking does not necessarily qualify that media as queer coded, nor even necessarily makes it queerbait. sometimes a dynamic exists between coding or baiting. do some pieces of media take advantage of that hazy middleground to earn the attention of demographics that otherwise won’t pick it up? yes. you can argue shounen owes much of its pull to how audiences would rather invent upon a dynamic between two men than, say, take an explicitly queer shoujo romance between two women. but i don’t think we should equate the reach of transformational fandom as deliberate queer coding on the creators’ behalf. that includes naruto, no matter where naruto &amp; sasuke could have ended up, whether or not kishimoto intended for them to be this or that. but i also don’t think that erases what fans see in that dynamic, in this series, and especially not the queer demographic. i think there’s a way to juggle all of that at once. <br><br>am i making sense? i hope i am. i’m happy to elaborate more, and ty for indulging my thoughts 😞</div>

 <div class=question>helloo sha !! the other day i was having a conversation with a friend about my favorite pairings from animes or series and realized in a good majority of them, theres a character i kin/identify with immensely and and the other one is usually just my type? as if person A is me and person B is just the type of person that i look to be loved by irl? if that makes sense? i’ve never self inserted or anything before this was a terrifying realization to come to 😭 i started to realize when i write for them i either write for how i want person A, the one like me, to be loved. and how they’re loveable. or how they can love. and i was bewildered by the somewhat self centeredness of it all ???? i really am just loving qualities that i have and showing people that yes this can be loved !!! its true !!! and also, they can love so hard and meaningfully !! like when i write about person A loving person B i really drown in my own words. it was such an odd realization and i found it so embarrassingly silly i had to walk around my room screaming about it for a bit. kept thinking am i really just falling in love with myself or at least a version of myself i used to be or can be, over and over again? i was just losing my mind over it i truly had nothing better to think about at that time and thought this was something i’d show a therapist and say ok see i am not mentally well. i’ve found it hard to write again since too because i’m just getting a little embarrassed about it every time and stop. not even because its cringe in a way but bc im just struggling with the newfound realization that i actually love my own qualities so much despite me having so much anxiety and insecurities over them. very mind boggling <br><br>but anyway so i wanted to ask you if you have noticed something similar with the pairings you like, and if not, why you like your favorite pairings as much as you do ^-^ im very curious about how other people interpret their own favorites now. and having read your writing and how well your characters are fleshed out i really wanted to ask !!</div>

 <div class=reply>oh this is so interesting !! i was thinking just the other day that only recently have i really gotten into a pattern of having characters more similar to me as my favs, which overall i’d say reflects well on where i’m at in terms of self-acceptance? i think i’d always stay extra self-critical, but there is a part of me that embraces my own personality and disposition a lot more these days for sure. <br><br>in fics, though, i tend to avoid characters similar to me, actually! the more i have in common with a character, the less likely i am to want to write them. it kinda just. muddies the writing process for me. one of my biggest personal no-nos is writing a character and losing the plot bc i was subconsciously projecting onto them — which to me defeats the fun of writing. deciding what to write next for me these days is a bit like an actor taking on roles they’ve never done before / roles with careers and lives they would never try otherwise. <br><br>but also to be very fair a) i don’t experience romantic attraction / can’t fall in love and b) i can see why people would want characters they mirror to be a proxy for a path towards love, whether as giver or receiver. so i love this for u !!! i imagine it’s a bit like how people like to imagine happy endings for fiction based on their real lives, and i think it’s neat taht writing can offer catharsis that you otherwise won’t have within your control irl. so truly, truly, truly, it might feel embarrassing for you in the moment, but i hardly think it’s silly. if anything, i’m glad that avenue is available to you. like, loving yourself through the love you imagine possible, even if only on the page for now? i think it’s an incredibly valuable perspective on your own qualities. <br><br>but i will say that i tend to only like pairings where at least one of them is my fav character. i guess that’s the closest i have to what you describe. sure, the fav character in question likely has little in common with me or else i wouldn’t feel comfortable writing them, but still. the fic acts as a sort of vehicle for everything i love about this character through the lens of a dynamic i find interesting. that’s why fic is fun and necessary for me, i think. it’s everything i can’t fit into a tweet or explore in just messages. i know fic is a complicated corner of the writing world, but i also know it’s taught me a lot about how to love characters through the act of writing them. all of which to say that i love that it’s also made self-love possible in your own experience 🫶🏼</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! I hope you're doing well. i am seeing a bit of spring in my very cold canadian region, so i hope you are too! so... hmmm. i'm wondering if you've seen the jjk leaks and have any thoughts. i feel a bit guilty sending this ask, because even though you've always been nothing but kind it also feels a bit like knocking on someone's grave (because i've read the ask and ones after it about your departure from jjk) but i just. i'm not expecting the chapter leak to have woken anything in you, in fact, i wouldn't be surprised if it maybe solidified your current feelings, but i guess i just have to ask because you've built such a wonderful itadori and megumi in my mind, and their relationship is so strong and protective of each other, that i just... this chapter hurts a little extra. but i've also made my own departure from jjk, and i have the happy ending of your fics too, so no pressure if you really don't feel anything. have a great rest of your week &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>i have heard about it! it’s funny how many messages i got of just Did You Hear About JJK, no clarification. and like. i’ve said some blunt things about jjk and i stand by them. even when i was writing for it, i had no idealisms about it, though mostly bc i know from experience that pieces of media need to be less than mindblowingly unique and great to attract huge active followings. the transformative nature of fandom relies on it. fandoms will rarely form around things it can’t invent over, if not outright improve upon. i’m the same. i don’t think i would have ever written fic for the series i did, including jjk, if i didn’t think man i adore these characters, i adore what they give me to work with, and it upsets me that the story is doing nothing with them (or at least, from my biased perspective, not exploring them to their full potential.) <br><br>but the specific thing about jjk is that it feels directly hostile? it’s not just a mangaka who doesn’t know how to love their story, their characters, the world they’ve built — it’s a mangaka who seems to actively hate all of these, and it shows in the writing. idk what akutami’s personal situation is, obviously, and i know they didn’t want to write jjk and it’s a shame it blew up and cornered them into writing a story they have no ounce of delicacy or care for, but my point is that it makes complete sense why people would be so hurt. i’ve seen people so carelessly be like jjk was never that good anyway real shounen should be like [insert name of other flawed shounen manga they want to champion] and while plenty of work ARE better than jjk, i think the hurt here goes beyond just a matter of quality writing. it’s not just oh we’re really doing this — but oh we’re doing it Like This. with These characters. in This way. add to that how all of this comes after so many storytelling choices that feel careless at best, and it’s like. i am giving you this hurt bc i love these characters, but you did not Earn this hurt. and that makes me hurt even more. <br><br>all this to say that no, i personally don’t really feel anything, but i do feel protective of the people who continue to love yuuji and megumi — and gojo and everyone, even if not jjk as a whole. there’s a secondhand level of defensiveness i feel on the existing audience’s behalf, but also a lot of like. writerly disapproval, if not disgust. so if there’s a name for the emotion you feel when you stand in solidarity with someone’s hurt even if you don’t actively feel the hurt — that’s where i’m at. though i prob have no right to it. but no matter what i bid my own itfs my best goodbyes some time ago. the sincerity of that will never change. <br><br>thank you so much for being so so thoughtful and considerate about how to approach asking this question, and for your kind words. i wish you a gentle rest of your winter 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>YOU JUST REMINDED ME THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL EXISTS WITH THIS MESSAGE, OH MY GOD. HOLD ON. RAN OVER TO LOG IN AND CHECK ON IT BC IT HAS COMPLETELY SLIPPED MY MIND.

HOW MANY THINGS HAVE I BEEN NEGLECTING. <br><br>anyway more importantly — thank you so much for checking it out !!! it means a lot that you took the time to watch so thank you so much for your attention and kind words. i know i can be quite the lethargic and dull speaker, so i’m really, really glad the thoughts reached you nonetheless !!<br><br>and oooh it’s interesting you say that bc one of my official jobs is actually in podcasting !! so for what it’s worth it it’s a space i have a relative amount of comfort in? i Have thought about it briefly, especially with the boom of podcasts during the pandemic outbreak, but to be honest with you i just don’t think i have the sort of interesting personality that can sustain a podcast…? structured video essays are one thing, and i know people have hosted podcasts with less, but i’m not meant for any kind of performer/entertainer role, i think… not to say this hypothetical podcast is of that scale — but you get what i mean. i’ve always wanted to try being a late night radio dj, though. or at least incorporate that format into a podcast. play some songs. answer some quick anonymous queries. play more songs. but i think that’s just my attachment to late night radio growing up speaking. there’s music copyright stuff to think about in the podcast format, etc. but it’s a very fun idea for sure!<br><br>this is just a long-winded way of saying yes, i’ve thought about it, and it makes me feel very endeared that you did as well. no plans on podcasting outside of my irl work at the moment, but it means a lot that the thought crossed your mind — and i just appreciate the support endlessly as a whole. thank you, thank you, thank you. i hope you have a wonderful february 😕💗</div>

 <div class=reply>i was just thinking that my hairpin turns playlist was lacking some lizzy mcalpine omg uncanny timing… and you’re so right… you’re So right. erase me from the same album also has some of the vibes of that au but with hate to be lame in particular it’s about not needing the other two but wanting them anyway to the point of need. so much that you’ll lie, that you’ll get rid of the “baggage.” oh, i am so sad about them. in a meaningful way. i really just mean that i miss them already and it’s so nice to hear you associate them with a song that i also like so tysm for taking the time to tell me this. i also wish you nothing but days filled with warmth 🌱☀️</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha! are you well? <br>i hope it’s okay to ask— what would you suggest to a uni student struggling to be a uni student? i’ve changed my major from film to psych to englit to eng writing and everything is monotonous to me— save for writing, which is too vulnerable and something i don’t like to force out… i was thinking latin bc i generally always had an interest in language and love the intricacies of grammar, plus it’d be cool to be able to read more available text in the future, but i’m not sure. <br>part of me wants to drop out and take time to learn myself— but i’m two years in already, and it would be the second time i dropped out, and i guess i’m afraid of coming short. <br>i hope you don’t mind me reaching out— but i remember reading one of your ccs telling someone to choose mental health over school when you can, bc you had done the opposite, and (i don’t mean to put words in your mouth) had regretted it a little. well. it’s the second week of school. im realizing i don’t really want to share my writing with my face attached, and that for so long i’ve used writing as an emergency to the point where i’ve merged it with my identity. i guess im realizing i don’t want to to be a writer anymore, not really— but i’m wondering if that’s only because i don’t want to be honest. i think when you’ve used writing as an emergency room, you can’t really hide from it. i’ve used writing as a way to analyze and understand myself and i just read myself so clearly a few days ago that i kinda just want to exist now, without the need to justify my emotions. writing has always been a justification for me. i am deeply regretting not sticking to psych…<br>idk! i know everyone gets cold feet. i know 20s aren’t smooth. but living has felt more like performing lately. i am well enough to know how unwell that is D:<br>thanks for all your consideration, sha. hope you have been taking care🫶🏼</div>

 <div class=reply>hmm i was just telling someone the other day that i wish people signed up for uni only when they’re 25 and older. i feel that too often people are expected to know what to do with their lives when they haven’t even Lived, and what does a 19 year old know about the real world, and how could that knowledge ever arm them with the facilities to know what kind of education would be most fulfilling for them? every single young person i’ve been around, it always seems so obvious what’s plaguing them, what’s making them so restless or angry, but you also don’t want to invalidate that very real feeling of being young and not knowing what the hell is meant to be going on to make all of this bearable. sometimes i wish people in their late teens / 20s understood themselves more, but the truth is that they just never do. even the most ~intelligent ones, even the ones that grew up too fast, they never have the right answers for themselves. why would they? we all still have so many years of realizations and wake-up calls ahead of us. the hope is that we grow up and Realize, then do it all over again. some people will never get there, but you hope nonetheless. <br><br>all this to say, if you’re too unsure and listless to cement what you’d like to do in uni rn, i think it’s more than fine to take a break. dropping out is such a final thing to say, but it doesn’t have to be. idk how it is where you live, but where i’m from, uni is expensive. too expensive to be paying an institution for time to figure it out. i understand the fear of dropping out and it not amounting to anything, but. too many people use school as an excuse not to figure anything out bc at least it’s smth to fill their days — but it doesn’t have to be school until you feel like it really has to be. there are workshops, one-off classes, internships, mentorships. you can explore writing under a diff name, can pitch and submit to mags. you can take on jobs to sustain you in the meantime. it doesn’t have to be school, but it doesn’t have to be nothing, either. people tend to think that if something is overwhelming them, then the only alternative is nothing. but i think. living will always feel like performing if life feels like a costume, but you won’t know your measurements until you put yourself out there to measured and learn how to tailor and sew to what you need best. <br><br>i know this isn’t very helpful, but all i can say is — don’t choose something just bc it’s better than nothing, and don’t choose nothing just bc it’s better than the something you have rn. if that makes sense. <br><br>in any case, i’m sending you all my well wishes. take care of yourself 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha&lt;3 i’m not sure if you remember me but i was the anon that wrote to you a while back about writing, about what to do when you feel unable to write, and therefore unable to make up for an insubstantial presence. i’ve been aiming for genuine instead of perfection these days and after what feels like Ages without writing, i’ve just written a poem on cain and abel and i’m very proud of it :]<br>i just wanted to thank you for answering that cc so openly and honestly. i still go back to it whenever i feel stuck and hopeless, and your words always help me. thank you for helping me recognize that writing will always be there for me.<br>i hope your days are gentle and devotional and endlessly kind&lt;3 i hope to read some more of your works in the future and will be patiently waiting and rooting for you!</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! i was wondering if you take any notes on the books you read? or keep a little common book handy? i’m not sure what’s going on but a lot of times i feel as if i can’t really articulate what i’ve just read… and as time passes it seems like i’ve forgotten entirely what the novel was about. this is probably really silly but i feel a little sad when this happens? because in the moment, it’s like, i love this book. i love it so dearly and i swear i’ll carry it with me forever, but not even two months later—maybe even one—i’ll forget majority of the book and realize i’m empty handed again, like i never read the book at all. is there a way to truly keep them with me? sometimes, while i’m reading, i start to realize words don’t have as much of an impact on me unless i really try, and i have to read again to actually digest what’s going on. i don’t know. is it concerning to have to read things twice in order to feel the weight of it, when, in the past, you immediately felt that weight on first read? and it’s not even a matter of understanding/processing the content but just. recognizing the heaviness in the words, you know, that visceral chill that comes before you had the time to process. i don’t know. where is the line between passive reading and the weakening ability to connect with words? i don’t know. i hope this makes sense. <br>anyhow, i hope you’re doing alright these days and that words have never staled for you🫶🏼</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t, actually! i’m not a fan of having my focus compromised when i read or watch a thing, so i don’t have a lot of patience for pausing to take notes down or annotating or highlighting. it ruins the experience for me if it’s not as low-maintenance as possible, and it’s only since i got a literal account that i even started keeping track of what i think about the books i end up finishing. <br><br>but i sympathize with your situation completely, and i don’t think your sadness is unfounded at all. i just think… we place too much onus on ourselves to remember, is all. i’m not sure why we always think it matters less bc we don’t have full recall of something, as if it calls into question whether or not we felt for a piece of work in the moment. i don’t think it does? it matters enough that you felt for something in that present moment. it doesn’t need to be immortal or infinite, that feeling. if anything, i think it will be a joy to have things to revisit anew only knowing i loved it once. it’s enough to have loved something once, however briefly. i think emotional memory and permanence naturally aren’t meant to come hand in hand, and so it’s a rare but wonderful thing when it does. maybe i’m just coming off hot from a fic i wrote about exactly that thought, but if i’m sure of anything rn, it’s that our culture’s obsession with recording and documenting is a futile endeavour that only compromises the one thing you should know: that this thing might have happened once, and that’s all. you read this book once, and maybe you felt for it, maybe you didn’t. you can try to note it all down, every single detail, every single emotion, but would that change the fact that your memory is subject to fading and at some point, you’ll look back at this perfect record and still only see details that mean nothing? <br><br>all this to say i think you’re too hard on your memory for something that ultimately holds no power over you. i just feel like. nostalgia is heavy, looking ahead to the future is too faint, but the only thing you owe the present is to be present in it. that kind of thing. you don’t need to record the now for your future self to remember. that much i know. i think you’re doing just fine, especially considering that the past three years, scientifically speaking, has been hard on everyone’s ability to encode memories. you’re entitled to feel sadness to memories you know you’ve lost, but i also think there’s value and meaning in that transience. so. i’m sending you all my warmth and well wishes. i hope you find even more books to love, now and ever.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello hello helloooo thank you so much for coming back i’m very charmed by all the questions you’ve dropped 🤍<br><br>must reads are… tricky. i think all the books i cherish deeply are also ones i read at a point of my life made for meshing well with it, and that renders my relationship with those books personal in such a way that makes me hesitate to recommend them universally. the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne, for instance, is technically not an intricate book at all, nothing impressive or even believable, not to mention its author has a terrible record with his other novels, but i treasure it a lot for reframing my view of the kind of stories i might love to consume and write. i feel very indebted to both it and the kite runner by khaled hosseini, which is like. the book that opened my eyes to the potential of storytelling. i’ve yet to reread it properly, and i’m kinda almost afraid to bc i feel like i’ll have a lot of cold-hearted criticisms about it now, but it remains a novel that’s irreplaceable in my mental hall of fame nonetheless. and quite recently i reread franny and zooey by j.d salinger (i know), which was a book i was Obsessed with as a teenager, and if i cemented anything this time, it’s that this might be The Book. my favourite book of all time. the book i hold closest to heart. the book i feel the most known by. all of which are sentiments that make me gag a bit bc you know. imperfect vulnerability. or vulnerable imperfection. but i’d also be remiss to answer this question objectively in any way. it really is these three books that come to mind first, personal and specific my perspective on them might be. <br><br>in any case, i wish you kind, warm days in turn, and thank you for all your generosity in my cc inbox !!</div>

 <div class=reply>i am as well as an unwell person can be these days, kind stranger, thank you very much for asking 🫶🏼<br><br>oooooh i do not have essay recs off the top of my head, unfortunately, but i do have: <br><br>◦ cain/caim by josé saramago, which is like witnessing someone confront the parent they resent during a much anticipated ted talk, and i mean that with no small amount of wonder. this novel mostly covers big events from genesis to deuteronomy-ish and it has been some time since i read it, but saramago’s brand of… anger? bitterness? spite? towards the biblical god is something i think about a lot even now. it feels only fitting that he wrote something following cain, and while the cain and abel part is only one segment technically, it does inescapably ripple through. lots of good bits here about cain and abel, though i’m biased bc this novel was foundational to my own fixation on cain as an essential figure of myth (but also just. you know. most founding stories are just stories of fratricide. brother on brother crimes everywhere.)<br><br>◦ this poem https://thebaffler.com/poems/genesis-mort<br><br>◦ this piece ugh https://www.triquarterly.org/issues/issue-149/murder-ballad-land-nod<br><br>◦ this interview with karvl ove knausgaard https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-power-of-short-stories/391658/<br><br>◦ “the robot bird tells me how it is i am in hell” from this set https://granta.com/three-poems-mccrae/<br><br>and a couple honorary mentions: <br><br>◦ this poem by orpheuslament on tumblr https://orpheuslament.tumblr.com/post/686967767175446528/text-id-two-brothers-in-a-field-are-enough-for<br><br>◦ this poem from substack https://divineauthor.substack.com/p/cain<br><br>i know it’s not a terribly thick or helpful list and i’m sorry for answering this while i’m feeling especially blank but this made me feel very tickled we love this question we love cain and abel we love talking about the old testament god</div>

 <div class=reply>oh whoa thank you !! i always feel like i’ll be cursing myself every time i talk about a project too much while writing it but a) it’s mostly superstition, one of the few defence mechanisms turned rituals i have while writing and b) it’s funny that i bring up talking too much about a project bc half of the time i genuinely have nothing to talk about until at least majority of the thing is done, so what even will i be cursing myself with<br><br>but those bits aside i am? technically? working on both an original thing and a fic? i mean the original thing has been on off on off for like half a year now, and it’s just me chopping up and shredding and dicing and sauteeing this manuscript i wrote when i was 18 to 19 and i hate it now but not the idea of its story so i am in the middle of trying to make it a better, more me kind of frankenstein’s monster. which is a daunting task if i’m honest and it doesn’t help that everyone i’ve talked to about it (one person. one person literally contracted to listen to me talk about it.) has just been way too indulgent and trusting that i’ll figure it out eventually by myself so. i have taken time i could be putting into that and started this blue lock wip instead. don’t know if i’ll ever post it, since it’s a bit too unlike my previous work on cityboys and i don’t really wanna throw it at people whose days are better off not interrupted by a notif where my own personal reaction would be “they wrote what for what?” BUT i did see the other day how many unpublished fics i have that i just left with a finished first chapter and nothing else so i’m feeling very sobered by that discovery. maybe sobered enough to finish this wip just to be contrary. we shall see. <br><br>but thank you for being interested enough to ask and i’m sorry for rambling at you! i am on the go right now and so my mind is as well! i hope all is as well with you as can be!</div>

 <div class=reply>hi !! i hope your day has been kind as well 🤍 <br><br>and hmm i… have given it a shot a couple times. i felt a bit lukewarm on it from the outset, but each episode i’ve tried has just discouraged me more and more. though i don’t think it’s Terrible necessarily? i really love her work with park chanwook, so i was looking forward to this since her one other drama didn’t land too well with me and i thought it might have just been the subject matter being too close to real life for me to see it as favorably as i should. but unfortunately this one was a miss as well. <br><br>with two examples to look at, i do wonder if i’m just not a fan of seeing jung seokyung’s writing expanded into your average kdrama structure? i think it’s a totally different ballgame than films, and i find that the work of otherwise strong writers can feel oddly bloated or sensationalist when they have to adapt their style and approach to a 40-50min one or two eps per week structure where the focus is on having a final moment — a cliffhanger, a reveal, a twist — that will linger until the next episode comes out. not saying little women is guilty of a little makjang, but it also could have used some restraint, at least from how much of it i’ve watched. especially when you’re dealing with themes like this — class systems, power to the little people, money is the real god, etc — i find that subtlety / allegory go much farther. you can’t write a story about the people who are burdened by system and then just string those characters along in the narrative without giving them the agency to decide for themselves how the plot will go, you know? that just defeats the purpose for me. but that’s kind of a tangent. actually all of this is a tangent whoops you can stop reading any time now if you still are<br><br>but my point is: kdramas as a whole are guilty of not trusting their viewers to catch on or keep themselves invested, and whatever conversations went behind the scenes that led to jung seokyung adapting to that in her own way just… didn’t work for me. which is a shame bc i do think it’s gorgeous. the symbols, the blocking, the composition, even some of the music were unexpectedly lovely. it just felt like they were serving a totally different story than the plot writing itself did. i hate being bludgeoned to death with story and coming out on the other side expected to say i had a good time just bc i sure did have A Time. so i guess you can say i’m also a bit biased against the kind of drama little women turned out to be. <br><br>all this to say — not for me. but i stay loving jung seokyung’s film scripts, and i’m glad she’s getting the attention she’s due for decision to leave.</div>

 <div class=reply>hi !! i love that this is my last cc of the night bc it feels like such a curveball after the last couple ones. just — i’m seriously grateful for all the thoughtful questions people leave on my inbox. but anyway. <br><br>(did you watch/read bones and all, by any chance? i feel like i’ve had a lot of conversations lately about cannibalism but they’ve mostly been with people who went to see it.)<br><br>ok fair warning i’m not read up on cannibalism at all beyond like. anthropological rituals and such. so i’m probably not the best person to ask. but some pieces that came to mind are:<br><br>lithub.com/cannibals-or-ghouls-the-elusiveness-of-language-in-bones-and-all/ (this is more an article than an academic/literary essay, but there’s some really nice thoughts here about personhood and the eating that they do in bones and all: <br><br>theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/03/why-female-cannibals-frighten-and-fascinate/519276/ (read this some back now and it’s more about the archetype (?) of the monstrous female character especially in the french film grave/raw, but i think no conversation around cannibalism is complete without examining hunger in the context of female desire) <br><br>https://youtu.be/dkAUYv3Mv0c (video essay on the movie i mentioned just above) <br><br>https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/23/style/cannibalism-tv-shows-movies-books.html (on the rise of cannibalism themes in recent tv, movies and books, very surface look but i’m linking it in case one of the references quoted catches your eye)<br><br>https://amchoreo.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/hc3a9lc3a8ne-cixous-stigmata-escaping-texts.pdf (pdf for helene cixous’ stigmata, which is honestly kind like reading someone’s rambling diary but you weren’t there to find the inside jokes funny. not linking here for the full thing, only one specific section called “love of the wolf” that is Kind of about the physical consumption of that which/whom we love. it’s not exclusively nor explicitly about the act of cannibalism, but there’s some juicy ruminations there about the nature of love and the hunger it perpetuates, like “for us, eating and being eaten belong to the terrible secret of love. we love only the person we can eat. the person we hate we ‘can’t swallow.’ that one makes us vomit. even our friends are inedible. if we were asked to dig into our friend’s flesh we would be disgusted. the person we love we dream only of eating.”)<br><br>wow i’m so sorry this is not a robust list at all… most of them are just. magazine pieces. really shows you what i read most often 😭</div>

 <div class=question>hi, sha. i need advice on something re:writing and i don’t really know who to talk about it with so i thought i would ask you, since i actually really look up to your works :] i hope that’s alright with you. the thing is, i want to be a writer. god, it’s the thing i want the most in the world, you know? every time i finish a book only to find it has left even the smallest impression on me, i become once again suddenly aware of this dull throb in my chest, something empty that i can’t seem to ever fill since quite some time ago. i want that, too. i want people to read my works and get that feeling, that warmth, that momentary desperation of ‘what now?’ right after they close the back cover of a book. but i also haven’t been able to write for so, so long. perhaps for some people, including you, it isn’t that long; a year, more or less, of empty docs and meaningless words thrown haphazardly onto a page in (dashed) hopes that they’ll become something but i’m nothing, it’s nothing, and my eyes get so glazed over when i reach that conclusion that suddenly i can’t see well, and i refuse to, and i can’t have lost my passion for writing in a year. but i’ve taken breaks, i’ve outlined stories, characters, worlds down to every little detail, but when the moment comes to bring them to life i–i can’t. i can’t do it. i might start, i might rack my brain trying to come up with meaningful metaphors and i might even cry trying to make my writing match the prose i love so dearly but then it stops, i stop, and i feel so hollow. my words, too, are hollow. the reader would see they are if they read them. and it hurts and i tell my friends about it but all they say is ‘perhaps you need a break’ or ‘don’t be so dramatic, it’s not the end of the world’ but for me it feels like so because god, if i don’t have my words, if i don’t have my stories, if i don’t have my passion, then i am, beyond any doubt, left with nothing in this world that i truly can call my own. and that’s unbearable and i don’t know what to do and i don’t want to ever believe i’m done with writing. i try to give it time but the more it ticks by the more i seem to detach from the warmth i once carried on my fingertips, ready to burst, to bloom, to create, and it hurts so much. i don’t know what to do, sha. this turned into more of a rant than anything else. i’m sorry about that. i guess i just needed to get it out, i just needed to say it, maybe ask if you’ve ever gone through something similar before, but i know i can’t ask a solution from you. thank you if you read up to here, you don’t need to reply, just… thank you for listening :)</div>

 <div class=reply>i know it’s groan worthy when someone starts a reply with a personal anecdote bc then it’s like. wow. this is a cringy find jesus ted talk. but. i stopped writing from 2018 and 2020. i won’t bore you with the contextual details, but i tried other things for a bit and it was total soulless crap. i just didn’t want to be honest with myself about how much i hated writing so much that reading made me sick too. i looked down at how easy it is for people to bang things out that others will think is good even when there’s no love in it. that makes someone disillusioned, &amp; very aware of the fact that your own aspirations in writing — to be read, to be loved for what they read from you — is so Goddamn superficial. you don’t want to write. you want to write something that will be loved. and i’d think, those are the same thing, but they’re not. it’s not even about writing for yourself vs other people, it’s that writing is a fickle, egocentric creature, and it will not come when it knows it will be used as a tool. if you want writing to come not only so it will be beautiful, but beautiful from Your hands specifically, then is it writing you love?<br><br>i think… writing, being a writer, loving writing… the ugly crap, the soulless crap, the impossible days, the two year break are all part of it. i missed writing during that break but i hated it more for not being what i wanted it to be. that’s Such a toxic relationship, you know? like only loving a daughter when she’s perfect, when she’s beautiful, when she does what she’s told. like falling for the idea of someone and lashing out at them for not being that someone. it just exhausts both parties, bc how can you sustain a relationship wanting someone to be something? <br><br>i think you’re burning yourself out wanting to make something beautiful, my dear stranger. i’m sorry if i sound like i’m berating you. i really am not. i have all the respect and empathy for what you’re going through. and i know i don’t know your life, only what i’ve gone through that might be similar. i can’t tell you if you need a break, or to try writing scripts instead, etc. but i don’t think you’re done with writing either. i just think you’ve hurt it quite a bit, and hurt yourself in the process.<br><br>i love writing more than anything in the world. i’m sure you do, too. that love makes us very desperate sometimes. but we shouldn’t take it out on writing when it’s all we have. it’s done a lot for us. let it be ugly. make mistakes, bc the real act of love is in fixing it — in editing, in trying again without beating yourself up for making the mistake in the first place. it’s very fun, writing. but you have to let it breathe. you have to let yourself breathe. <br><br>i hope this makes sense :( i’m sending you my deepest, warmest well wishes.</div>

 <div class=reply>no shame At All in that. do you know how many people just sit there and read something without even thinking oh i should probably critically engage with it? but you did ask at an uncannily good time, bc i saw this post on my dashboard a few days ago. i haven’t gone through it, but i thought it was an interesting list: https://northwindow.tumblr.com/post/705391261040902144/reading-on-reading (for your purposes in particular, i’d say try "uncritical reading" by michael warner?) <br><br>but the truth is that i don’t really read and remain critically engaged at the same time. like, i don’t open a book and experience it while actively thinking about my problems with it. i feel like i wouldn’t be able to enjoy anything if i did that, and i don’t expect anyone to be doing that all the time, either. <br><br>i think critical thinking can happen outside of the immediacy of experiencing a piece of media. how can you analyze if you have no personal feelings about something? what, exactly, will you be analyzing then? the prose? which you can, obv, but a lot of analysis starts with thumbs up / down / neutral. ofc you won’t know what you don’t like if you don’t know what you like. that’s why it’s so dangerous for people’s tastes to be decided by trends, bc a need to conform deprives people of deciding for themselves what they like or dislike, and the lack of ability and opportunity to do that is why we have people who can’t consume media critically. you think this part is cool? why? is it bc this is a scene you’ve been waiting to happen for 200 chapters/pages now? this part made you cry? why? did it accurately capture something you’ve experienced? did this part not sit right with you? why? is it bc it feels unearned by the story, or is it bc it isn’t consistent with how you’ve understood the character until now? i think you run into danger of not thinking critically when you want to analyze in the moment. what would you see about something you’re only seeing this current fragment of? <br><br>so let yourself enjoy (or not enjoy) and Then work out those analysis muscles. critical media consumption is still a muscle that you have to get into the practice of using before it becomes second nature, and i don’t think you or anyone should be humiliated about seeking out how to get there. it’d be even weirder if i just woke up one day being like I Will Critically Analyze Now. no, people start as consumers with opinions. and just bc i have takes doesn’t mean they’re always right or not surface level either. the point is that we acknowledge this and not take media for granted. that doesn’t mean we don’t enjoy things for what they are, either. <br><br>i’ve rambled at you enough, but hey. there’s no textbook guide to critical analysis. you just become a critical consumer first in the most basic of ways. at least if you ask me, but i’m sure there’s smarter syllabi out there for media criticism.</div>

 <div class=question>i have been revisiting your jujutsu kaisen series - one that i sincerely hold dear even though im no longer that in touch with the fandom - and im delighted to find out you have watched and seem to like mob psycho. if it may not be too much to ask, i wonder if you ever have plans to delve into it as a piece of writing? if not, id love your thoughts on at least whats your favorite parts of the work, which characters give you brainworms - a long answer is not needed but im genuinely interested. i think the way you look at and dissect stories is what i strive for. thank you for your time</div>

 <div class=reply>thank u so much for your kind words !! here’s a cc i answered on mp100 (if it’s of any interest) ✨ https://curiouscat.me/sleeptowns/post/1286043641<br><br>i won’t ever Dream of writing for mp100, and i say that genuinely as a mark of just how good it is. i have never read or watched it and thought… ah. i can/should do something with that. bc it’s never once given me anything that it didn’t handle itself far better than i think any other series in its position could have. i think mp100 is unique in the sense that it’s reliant on the genre it subverts, and yet it also delivers a story that is so, so simple and yet so, so pitch-perfect. it’s just so reflective to me of how a story need not be bombastic to have depth and stakes and a sense of closure by the end not bc the big bad of the plot has been resolved but bc we’ve spent time with characters whom we love and want the best for. i do think the final arc is the weakest, but it’s a sign of how great the arcs that precede it are that the point where it all comes together is the weakest.<br><br>but !! s2 is my fav season, but i think it’s unfairly stacked against the others considering it had the mogami arc, the separation arc &amp; the world domination arc. this was also one of the best small scenes in the whole series: https://youtu.be/nPN5R9RQHbU, and i Love the composition of the s3 scene where teru realizes he’s being brainwashed. my fav standalone ep is the post s2 ova. it makes me laugh So much. teru isn’t the character i have brainworms about, but he’s prob still my fav character, primarily bc he’s so ridiculous and yet so earnest about his own character development. i wasn’t expecting to get choked up during his fight against ???% but i should have known bones would cut through the drama of the battle itself and adapt that fight into what it is: mob’s quiet journey alone towards the goal he’s had since the beginning, all the while wrestling with the part of himself that he’s tried to lock away for so long now, and how that parallels reigen’s own self image and his final desire to be truly himself for this one kid whom he’s never wanted to see him as anything but someone worth seeing as a mentor.<br><br>running out of space ahhh i can talk abt it forever but i just love that mp100 is a story about finding yourself, whether you’re a teru or a ritsu or a tome or a reigen or a serizawa or a takenaka. it’s adapted to a world that contains so much more, but underneath it all, it’s about selfhood and its complexities and challenges &amp; rewards. it comes down to what each character wants, and it’s a real treat that the story answers, in the end, with the ursula le guin quote that’s like “we’re each of us alone, to be sure. what can you do but hold your hand out in the dark?”</div>

 <div class=reply>is it a copout if i just link you to my newsletter thing on one specific arc/scene https://cherrypick.substack.com/p/kieta-hatsukoi-its-not-a-big-deal<br><br>no i’m kidding i quite liked kiekoi !! both the drama and the manga. i think it’s made with a lot of heart that feels reminiscent of the romance and slice of life animes i grew up with — i’m thinking loosely of kimi ni todoke, toradora, lovely complex, even comedies like hyakko and azumanga daioh, that sort of thing — so there’s a sense of delicacy and nostalgia that i’m really pleased to see in a love story with a character like aoki at its centre. i think everyone is so so charming, and nothing is ever too heavy-handed, from the premise to aoki realizing he has a crush on ida now and not hashimoto, even the arcs i’ve read post-ida and aoki getting together. there’s a sense of comfort to it, at least the chapters/episodes i’ve touched. and i love that it’s a shoujo! there’s just something about it being a recognized winner in the genre that feels just right, like an evenly-frosted cake that doesn’t leave you feeling bloated or like you shouldn’t have eaten it after a big meal.</div>

 <div class=question>hi, sha ! first love anon here !! <br><br>thank you for being so kind to me in your answer, i’m sorry this reply is so late :( it means a lot to me, especially when i’m so used to hearing universally said, surface-level things like “men aren’t worth it” or “he doesn’t deserve you” from very well-intending friends – it’s so difficult knowing that none of my friends will ever know about how sweet or caring he could be. i think that the hardest part wasn’t even the breaking up, but just the abruptness of it all, the suddenly watching someone lose interest in you even when they liked you first, and just knowing nobody will ever measure up to him. i think i saw it in a tiktok slideshow (ik) but i read something vaguely along the lines of “what if i’m cursed to look for a piece of you in everyone i believe myself to be in love with again” and it’s the knowing that inevitably, every boy i ever love again will have some trait i first realized i loved in him, which is unfortunately a sizeable part of what makes everything so painful – and i’m so, so terrified that even when we both eventually end up in different relationships, watching him be so sweet to another girl might just wreck me emotionally all over again, especially since we’re still in the same friend group, despite not being able to hold a conversation with each other anymore. like this is so silly, but just remembering i’ll never get another “this reminded me of you” text or a hug is just too weird to comprehend. <br><br>i’m really sorry this isn’t coherent or well-structured in the slightest :( i won’t lie, i do feel a bit stupid crying for far too many weeks about a comparatively short relationship in my last year of high school (lol). i think that i’ve been trained to believe love as sort of something that underlies everything, from media to real interaction, and it’s confusing to separate him from seeing love displayed in media, especially when so, so much of the media i love now is recommendations from him. but you were right, about time healing and how the best thing is to keep going – it still hurts, but i feel less like inwardly collapsing whenever someone mentions his name – and there’s so much more to life than, well, a teenage boy. though i still think of him far more than i wish i did, he doesn’t occupy as many of my thoughts as he used to. i’ve been able to spend time with my family and friends, and sometimes, i can get through the whole outing without wishing he was there, too.<br><br>anyway, i have a sticky note with “no one’s asking you to replace your first love, but the bigger the world you live in, the better it becomes equipped to distribute the weight of the perpetual heartbreak we’re all carrying” (from your last cc answer) on my desk now :)</div>

 <div class=reply>hello again !!! thank you for dropping by another time, i found myself thinking about how you were doing the other day but i cannot for the life of me remember what prompted it now but ahhh i’m glad at least something from my last reply was worth highlighting :( it really is difficult, i think, bc we can say that some relationships aren’t worth it/aren’t what we deserve all we want and sure they can be true but it still wouldn’t take away what you’re feeling. it’s a moot point, in the aftermath of a relationship. and sometimes it’s a bigger burden to hear it bc then you’re forced into a position where you feel like you’re meant to feel this way and since you feel differently, it’s almost like you’re wrong for still feeling the way you are. which you’re not. no one is. even the people meant to love us, like our parents and whatnot, can hurt us in irreparable ways, but it’s also true that sometimes good people will hurt you in a way outside of either of your control. and that’s hard and bizarre, especially since he was the ~first in many respects.<br><br>and you know, this isn’t at all to be doom and gloom about adult relationships, quite the contrary — i think we carry all sorts of people in all sorts of ways throughout our lives. there will be relationships you’ll have to let go of, and even selves you’ll have to shed. i’m at an age rn where it’s really difficult to clean my room, bc i always find a gift from someone i no longer talk to, or a letter from someone who fell out of my life after they got a significant other. and it’s easy to say that we can smile bc it happened and that’s better than not experiencing it at all, but — my point is. everyone you’ll meet and love will be a first in some way. first friend to make going to the movies your official go to hangout, first partner to like cooking for you, etc. if you lose them, going to the movies or cooking won’t be the same. i think a life lived is a life full of first loves, even crappy ones. it’s not a bad thing, and you’re allowed to grieve them if they have to go. but i think people are onto something when they say the heartbreak is also part of the love. with obvious caveats, but hey. you have to have loved something pretty bad to grieve losing it. whether or not it was a good person or a friend or if you deserved him or not… it’s all confetti. the emotion is what you had, and the emotion is what you’re left with. and that’s okay. <br><br>anyway. i stand by what i said in the last cc, is the tldr, and i’m glad there are things that have gotten easier with time. i wish you so many more of them until the end of time 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! i hope this is not too personal of a question, but im in my early twenties and everything is a bit confusing D: i hope to learn from you, but if this is a question too prying, please disregard it completely.<br><br> i’m realizing now that i have a propensity for solitude— whether i want to or not, i always pull away at some point, keep a nice distance between myself and others even if care and trust is present. (i honestly *could* be better with communication, but… that’s a whole different matter.) i understand that once you choose solitude, you live as both the heel rushing through life but also the extending hand that supports you after a fall. and even though i’ve played both roles for quite some time, i still can’t help but feel like this cheap version of independence is really just a morphed face of obligation that stems from a hesitance towards vulnerability. i’m easily read and it makes me entirely uncomfortable, and in consequence of that, i’ve developed a habit to isolate myself when things go awry. it’s really off putting, but it’s safe.<br><br>i saw your tweet about there not being anywhere else you would go [besides from yourself, your solitude] because there’s not anywhere else you can go. i guess what i’m asking is if you’ve ever felt confined by yourself, and if so, if there was anything helpful that shifted your solitude into quiet agency. i feel like i should’ve reached that by now. <br><br>regardless if you answer or not, thank you for letting me talk here. i hope winter hasn’t been too cold for you. &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>hi hello i know you just sent over that follow up cc several hours ago but i just wanted to say that i didn’t find this intrusive and unnecessary at all :( god no. i'm not sure if i can answer it well, but i’d still like to take a shot at answering it. but you don’t have to read on if you’re not comfortable revisiting the subject! <br><br>i think it’s fair to feel as if going between the labour of being around people and the labour of having to be a self is like being the ball in a game of ping pong. there’s no real winning here, and i empathize a lot with what you call this cheap version of independence as a facade for hesitance towards vulnerability. but the way most people understand independence is it’s the opposite of external dependence, as in rather than depending on other people, you depend on yourself. which is a pain for me too honestly. i’m definitely going against the etymology of the word rn but i personally like to define independence as a kind of anti dependence. and that includes dependence on yourself and your coping mechanisms and your safety behaviours. i think selfhood is only possible when there are no factors you Rely on to be a self, and that includes what you define as safety if it means placing the burden on yourself to actively ignore what’s making you unsafe. running away from what’s unsafe doesn’t automatically equal safety.<br><br>i do often feel confined by myself even now. i still go quiet and isolate myself when things feel unsafe, but rather than berate myself for that instinct, i’ve tweaked it a little to do things like. telling people i don’t feel good about this situation atm, but it’d be nice if they can give me a few days or weeks to step away and think through what i Am comfortable sharing. it’s a bit like finding a compromise between still being responsible for my relationship with another person, bc i’m forced to still find a way to share what i’m able to, even if it’s not always Complete vulnerability. but i still am given my space. <br><br>you don’t owe people what They define as vulnerability, but you shouldn’t be entirely dependent on yourself or your own evasion tactics either. solitude shouldn’t be a burden. i think the point of solitude is that there’s no need to be dependent on anything, and no demands to be one particular kind of individual. it shouldn’t be something you choose so you can run away from something else. that’s not solitude nor independence. that’s just running away. there’s agency, then there’s running away from when you Have to take agency, from when you have to be an individual. i think that what you’ve described is actually the opposite of independence. it’s self imposed exile. <br><br>rambled a lot here but i am sending you all the warmth and kindness in the world, whether or not you ended up reading this reply. i empathize with your situation deeply. i truly do. i hope the year ahead is infinitely kind to you.</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh fav shows are a tie between the bear and weak hero class 1 hands down. i’m convinced the string of lacklustre media i’ve had to watch since i finished those two has been punishment for how much i enjoyed both. <br><br>movies, though… hm i think the only movies i finished this year were nope. decision to leave. dune. matt reeves’ batman. the menu. everything everywhere all at once. that might be all of it wow ?? i started a lot lot lot more but. waves hand. i have a lot of weary thoughts about films that people in my circles enthusiastically recommend to me/tout as their fav — nothing against them for liking the film as a person, but it does make me reevaluate where the bar is for today’s films, sometimes, when i’m feeling bitter about media consumption. sometimes i feel like people just watch films to participate in the culture of filmwatching — which, what does that even mean, sha? idk. there’s that part in the menu where he says he had a rare day off and he spent it on a disappointing movie, and that’s how i’ve felt about films people have nudged me towards in the last two years. i can’t believe i used to be a tiff regular. i’m not even trying to be contrarian here and be pretentious. i don’t like film enough to be pretentious about it, that’s the main problem. i wish i had Fun crappy watches at least. but no it’s just [redacted bc i feel mean now but i also can’t redact the part where i am still very very weary]<br><br>anyway. i did love nope. jordan peele’s best one so far, imo. decision to leave was quite great, but it wasn’t park chan-wook’s strongest. that’s the extent of my list of fav movies of the year. i am so sorry for rambling at you. i just realized how i felt about films the moment i started replying. did not mean to dump that all there i hope you skipped to this paragraph 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>the way that it’s been so long since i sat down with my cc inbox that this is from around christmastime 😭<br><br>of her books, i’ve only read all about love, and the others i’ve had to consume in sections for a class or a work project. i… remember being devastated when we lost bell hooks. i think she’s an invaluable figure in any conversation involving race and feminism and gender, and especially re: how no true discussion around these are complete without the difficult nuances we must force ourselves to confront in order to truly be intersectional. a lot of the time removing ourselves from one system of oppression means in turn feeding into one that oppresses others, and i appreciate how bell hooks’ body of work encompasses all these while remaining rooted in the simplicity of love and its many forms, and how at the end of the day there is a kind of rebellion in allowing ourselves true community and the vulnerability that comes with deep love — for ourselves and for each other, regardless of what those systems of oppression want to convince us of. <br><br>that said — and i’m being very careful here, bc far, far, Far be it from me to refute bell hooks of all people — i don’t always agree with how she applies her philosophy to real world examples, for instance, or how it has adapted to this current sociocultural climate. i also find that bell hooks herself is not immune to participating in the systems she criticizes, or at least to falling into analogies or rhetoric that might be outside of her regular areas of discussion. i’m thinking specifically of her conversation with laverne cox* not too long ago, which i remember watching a few times bc of one conversation point where they discussed femme / “feminine” expression. it was def a more tense push in the talk, but that’s exactly the kind of exchange that is so valuable, and i respect how candidly they both handled it. and lastly, i think all about love is best read when you’re still a bit younger, when it still has the space to guide your perspective as you come of age and reassess all its themes; i feel like i read it at a point where none of it really Hit me as new, brain-rerouting information — which i think is a really, really good thing, bc there remains the fact that bell hooks is an icon in these conversations for a reason, and that’s thanks in no small part to how she put all these experiences to words and we now as a culture can read it and see where we’re positioned in terms of what we already know and how much work there is still left to do.<br><br>* i looked up that talk just now to make sure i’m not misremembering the memory and came across this them article. i just skimmed it for now, but i think it’s a great summation of how i feel about bell hooks: https://www.them.us/story/bell-hooks-laverne-cox-feminism-2014-new-school</div>

 <div class=question>what does a perfect academic environment look like to you? like what would you look for in a university/school that’d make your experience there memorable?</div>

 <div class=reply>i really love how you phrased this !! with a perfect academic environment being a component to a memorable time in uni, i mean. i totally agree. <br><br>but hmm when i was choosing universities and majors, i think my main intention was looking for the smallest possible class sizes? partly bc i hate being in crowds and busy cities, but also partly to kind of hack how i learn best — which is to receive direct feedback and constructive criticism from as close to the source as possible, with the source being the prof or the prof’s assistant. i hate faceless, soulless criticism; if i’m doing well, i’d like to know why, or else it won’t matter to me, and the same if i get lower than what i was expecting. i felt like you can’t really have that experience in bigger classes, where the exams are multiple choices on scantron sheets and you’re like a hundred people in one room where the prof has to use a mic and participation points are counted from a device. it’s a funny thing considering i had really bad social anxiety and should have liked the facelessness, but it just felt like there was no point to learning if it feels like i’m just being handed the thing to do and i’ll get a check mark if i do it. it’s not very stimulating, and so to loop back to your question, i’d say stimulation is what makes a perfect academic environment for me. my pattern throughout my first two years of uni is that i’d skip all my bigger lectures bc you can pass them without problem if you just read all the material before the midterms and exams, which i regret bc some of them were still interesting subject matter. but compare that to how wholeheartedly i did the work for my smaller classes, where i know the TAs and profs know me whether or not i want them to and it will make me more anxious to be constantly incompetent at a class i literally chose to take. i also hated the concept of office hours, but i found that in classes where it’s like ten people exchanging thoughts and talking about the work we all had no choice but to do unless we wanted excruciating silence for two hours, i didn’t need to seek out the input or stimulation i needed. it was just there, in the class, so i never skipped them. i think i was even sorry if i ever had to miss one. those are the classes i still remember, and the subject matter i (mostly) retain. <br><br>the tldr of this answer is that i think it’s good to know how you learn best and what makes learning stimulation/interesting for you, and for me it was smaller classes in a city quieter than the one i spent my teenage years in. i was also grateful to have found memorable extracurriculars and on campus jobs to pursue, but that really was just luck, whereas strategic class selections shaped what you might call and what i’d consider my perfect (ish) class environment.</div>

 <div class=question>same anon (again). i’m leaving my silly not-so-little rant here!<br><br>the thing is, have you ever entertained the possibility that life might be, at its very core, a loop of hypothetical regression, nostalgia, and timelines inevitably intertwining? you might be wondering what the hell is wrong with me, but i consider myself a pretty deranged person when it comes to thoughts that make me ponder, so… here goes nothing, hehe. let me explain further. <br>if we stop to think about it, nostalgia is the feeling via which we bring back the past. things that were trending in the 90s or 2000s are trending now; everything which we call ‘retro’. a lot of people, including myself, enjoy old musicians, writers, movies, and aesthetics. everything a person does is influenced by what they once did, let it be regarding their personal stories or history, and what they will do in the future is thus a result of their present choices. we’re technically living the present through bits of the past and will live the future through bits of our present, not only because of history but also because nostalgia will always remain for as long as people keep growing older and time lasts. i was told countless of stories of older times by my parents, introduced to the musicians and movies that were blockbusters in the past, and that turned me into a person who longs for a life i’ve never had. i feel nostalgic about something that isn’t mine. this loop will go on when, in the future, a parent tells their kid about their former days and perhaps plant the seed of wonder and longing for all that is no more in them. it’s a loop of timelines overlapping, affecting each other and us, through nostalgia. the past will always live in the future.<br><br>for the regression bit of this sudden thought i had which is certainly messy And probably confusing, i’d have to go deeper into the theory of how timelines aren’t linear, but the gist of it is that, if reincarnation were to be real (thus this being hypothetical), you’d have the same chances of being reborn in the future as you’d have of being reborn in the past because time itself is a messy, complex thing and who even said it goes only forward, right? in fact, even though i’m more of a philosophy person rather than science, newton’s laws don’t distinguish between past and future. so, why can’t it go backward, too? that would naturally make it a loop both progressive and regressive, happening in tandem. you saying sisyphus is the main figure of the time loop idea is so interesting, too. i love it. that single sentence might as well describe everything i just ranted about. if we say the top of the hill is the future and the bottom the past, then sisyphus is constantly regressing to the past every single time the boulder falls. i’d love to hear more about your point of view on sisyphus as the representing figure of time loops!<br><br>have a great day sha!</div>

 <div class=reply>no i think you’re absolutely right on !! something something that one famous einstein quote about how physicists know there’s no distinction between past, present and future. and you also mentioned newton’s laws. when people say time is a construct, what they really mean is what we understand to be time, as in these boxes and slots of schedules — but time very much exists, just that it’s not what we’ve made it. thinking of that one npr segment called resetting the theory of time. <br><br>and i love what you said about sisyphus! sisyphus the original regressor fr but to be fair it crops up a lot in greek myth. prometheus. even tantalus, in some way, down to the rest of the house of atreus. it’s interesting that the looping is The element that makes something eternal. compare that to how time loops are seen in hollywood, like an obstacle for a hero to triumph over after the necessary lessons have been learned. there’s no such neatness in greek myth, and in manhwa, the idea of the regressor crops up in all sorts of iterations — a mc with stubborn unhinged empathy, a mc keen for vengeance, the protagonist of a novel subjected to different versions of the story, an antagonist who did try his best in the beginning to not be the villain. how many times can you make someone loop before the circularity is no longer synonymous with inevitability, right? how many times can you loop before the loop itself is the catalyst for the change? <br><br>but i’m digressing so hard again i think sisyphus is a popular figure these days bc life feels like boulder pushing. wake up, doomscroll, clock into work or go to class, doomscroll, numb yourself somehow, sleep. repeat. people often bring up “one must imagine sisyphus happy” but like. does sisyphus even know each day is a repeat? i’m always torn between “everything in life and history is circular and there’s no escape” vs. there’s no such thing as a repeat. of anything. ever. not snowflakes, not day to day routines. physics wise, something will always be different, and it’s only time as a construct that demands we see our days in such small, separate increments in the first place. <br><br>which is all to say that i do absolutely think you can reincarnate in the past. media like sea of tranquility and the tv show dark have done this really well, about how tying the past to the future makes the present makes the past makes the future and so on and so forth. and i think that’s what i really mean when i say time loops. bc hey, maybe time isn’t even a circle. maybe it’s a whirlpool. or penrose steps. maybe the oscillating universe theory or the ancient concept of the eternal return are it. if the stars we see are from the past, then can we look at the past and see the future? <br><br>this is starting to sound pretentious as hell i’m so sorry i’m extra garrulous these last set of replies and i should call it a night but tysm for your ccs and i hope you have a great day as well 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi! i’m the person who sent this ask. i finally checked it out and just finished reading the last article you linked. i Need you to Know that i now feel like my third eye has been opened and i have to take a break from my personal social media, or perhaps finally let go of the people that are no longer in my life in order to be able to, as the article says, eventually look back at it with some nostalgia left in me. everything you read is so interesting, truly, i find you to be such a fascinating person with many fascinating thoughts and points of view. i hope you know you dug your own grave, though, because i Will be returning to ask you for recs in the future hohoho (as long as that’s okay with you, of course).<br><br>and, well, this is random, but there’s an idea that randomly came to mind while reading that article, a thought maybe a bit too freaking insane, and i thought i’d share since it involves time loops! but since cc doesn’t let me ask (probably excessively) long questions, i’ll ask you in a different cc and you feel free to read it or not! <br><br>i also wanted to say nge was the resolute start of my “thinker” era as i like to call it. i watched it 4 times when i was a teenager trying to understand it and i had so many theories about it. i think, now that you mentioned it, that i’ll rewatch it since i’m pretty sure i’ll be able to form bigger and more coherent thoughts and ideas about it now. and ALSO (i’m a pest i know i’m so sorry) i’m so excited to start reading sss class revival hunter! i’ll also definitely check out everything else you mentioned, starting by anne carson’s translations because i’ve had a few of them in my tbr for a while and this was like A Sign. thank u for answering! i’ll leave my unnecessarily long rant in another cc in case you wanna check it out, but know you definitely don’t have to omg. i hope you have the bestest days!</div>

 <div class=reply>HELLO AGAIN. AND RIGHT? LIKE. IDK. i’m biased bc i’ve preferred a lot of the things in my life to remain transitory, but i really do think there’s merit in allowing things to remain in a shape you can be nostalgic about someday. i think that’s really what people mean when they say that sometimes to love someone or something is to let it go. that there are moments when letting go is an act of love bc it’s the thing that will ensure the love remains after the thing ends. <br><br>in any case, you’re too kind, thank you for indulging my looping/regression fixation and i am definitely, Definitely okay with you returning whenever and however much you’d like :( <br><br>also, yes, i actually do highly recommend rewatching nge with (so to speak) a bigger adult brain! it’s one of those things i watched as a teen for like. cultural capital. so as an adult i was often like ha it’s not that deep. but recently, i’ve been like… yeah it’s not that deep but that in itself is the depth of nge. especially the rebuilds, which to me is a really fascinating look at how a creator can revisit something he wrote and directed at a more tumultuous time of his life and only much, much later become capable of giving it an ending that is properly final. and for that ending to be hopeful and so unlike what the original was on track to become. someone on crunchyroll’s yt channel also did a video on all the nge timelines, and it’s a hot mess, but somehow everything the video guy said is essentially codified by the last nge rebuild movie so cheers to that bc regressor kaworu is a fun thing to think about <br><br>anyway i feel like i’m throwing so much at you and i just wanna say no obligation to pick up every single thing i mention but i am more than happy to hear your thoughts on anything you do check out — so on that note i will see you in the next cc ✌🏼</div>

 <div class=question>would you recommend learning latin? i’ve been thinking about studying it for a while now but it’s difficult because it’s a /dead/ language so i worry i won’t be able to properly immerse myself</div>

 <div class=reply>oh man if it was up to me all my interactions with the world would be conducted in only latin. but it’s def not universally accessible — the dead language part is a key thing, yeah, bc it’s not like you’ll be learning to ask where the library is, but it’s also a completely diff sphere of sociocultural linguistics after a certain level. that’s not to be like Oh Latin Is So Hard And Only Real Ones Commit To It. no. latin is not hard. i wouldn’t love something unnecessarily complicated. it might seem like a lot especially if a language learner prefers gamified methods of learning like duolingo or, like you, needs to speak it to be immersed in it, but if you ask me, it’s a delicious language for jumping into the deep end. it was plenty enough immersion to me to read extensively in latin, though to be a bit crude, the most noticeable advantage of the spartan whipping my profs gave me is that nearly the entire indo european family of languages seem almost suspiciously easy after latin.<br><br>my soliloquizing aside, i do recommend learning latin to any language learner who’s learning languages for like. what do i call it. the high of linguistics? there’s no way to say this like a normal person, but the clicky thing that happens in your brain when you no longer just understand another language by translating it into one you know better — you understand it as is without having to translate. that one. i think latin is amazing for working that part out until it’s a bodybuilder, and again, it does wonders for any other language you learn. latin’s truly thrilling to learn, in a way no other language has been quite as exciting for me to bathe in learning, not even english. there’s so much available in latin — ancient stuff, modern stuff, archaeological stuff, whatever the hell. it’s a language i’ll never finish falling in love with. <br><br>h o w e v e r if you’d prefer to learn languages more for utility, and for. you know. living your life. as you understandably should. which it sounds like you do bc your primary worry is that you won’t have anyone to speak it with — then maybe latin is not the move? i can’t think of one reason why you’d want to learn latin of all things if you want to speak a language with another person. like. i can’t imagine anything less rewarding than needing a language to be interpersonal to be immersive and turning to a language that most people did two years maximum of. <br><br>the tldr is that i love latin a lot and if everyone around me knew latin, i would love them all deeply for it. but i also know not everyone is equipped to put up with any initial barriers there might be just to have the language equivalent of achieving enlightenment after a really good blunt rotation — nor should they be. so i think ultimately it depends, but if you’re really looking for immersion, and you define immersion to be interactions in a language to really learn it, then i’d regretfully advice to pass on latin.</div>

 <div class=question>helloo sha!!! what do you usually do with your days? lately i’ve been getting this sense of boredom no matter what i do, and while sometimes i get hyperfixations like anime, novels, books, or shows, i just… feel very meh about it all right now. i was wondering how you go about your days? do you go out much or prefer to spend time alone? :D</div>

 <div class=reply>hello hello this is a really timely question bc i’m somehow managing life across three jobs these days and it’s made me more aware of what i do when i get a rare moment of free time 🤔<br><br>but spend time alone, definitely! i can’t envision a scenario where i’ll choose company over time alone, even when i’m going out. i’m most content when i have the house to myself, and even more when i have nowhere to be. i think if i can just sit on my floor with my headphones on and do whatever i do that passes for a proper hobby — i like to build mechanical keyboards from separate parts instead of kits, and the same with my furniture — then i’ll be pretty at peace as is, even if not entirely happy with life. but that’s when i have Time time. as in hours to spare. a lot of the time i probably just daydream. like i wish i could tell you that every free moment i have i read or watch something enriching, but that wouldn’t really be true. i do sometimes just sit on the floor and read a manhwa or a manga until the latest chapter, call it a day at that, continue with my life, and never pick up the series again no matter how much i liked it. though i’ve been really into collegehumor’s dropout streaming service recently, esp dimension 20’s neverafter and game changer. maybe that’s a sign of aging.<br><br>all this to say i feel you a lot on the sense of boredom! but i will say that i think it’s important to have a third thing, with the first being a hyperfixation and the second being a low stakes yet productive hobby. i feel like people tend to highlight the importance of being invested in something to give you access to escapism, or if not that, they tell you to do self-care things like paint freely or bake or cook or garden to remind you that life is worth living. and both are obv important, but sometimes it’s nice to have that fallback of. i’m not really doing anything. nothing that matters, and nothing that will last beyond this moment of not really doing anything. i think there’s freedom in being someone who does nothing, and a lot of the time boredom is reflective of a desire to be someone who’s not just doing nothing. but it’s prob borderline pretentious to word it like that, and i do get needing to be stimulated by something. the older i get, the harder to come by those have been, and idk. i also value the absolute nothing that goes on in my brain when i’m building keyboards or furniture or whatever. like i could hammer my own thumb and i won’t know until it’s bleeding. but who knows. maybe voluntary dissociation is not the healthiest way to spend time. i am now ranting. i will now stop. why am i extra incoherent in tonight’s cc replies omg</div>

 <div class=reply>someone asks me for webtoon recs and my mind blanks bc all i can think of is pizza delivery man and the gold palace. but also that’s my personal taste speaking, completely subjective — which i think is the only way you can consume webtoons, actually? i don’t think there’s such a thing as objective recs when it comes to webtoons. each one occupies such a hyper-specific genre compared to, say, anime or tv shows, that i feel like i just have to throw a bunch at you and hope one sticks. though ahhh it’s hard like you have stunning art, stunning plot, stunning cast of character and then you have to pick two out of three 🥲<br><br>but hm i really do recommend pizza delivery man and the gold palace! truth or dare is a more melancholy, introspective read, but it was kinda weirdly comforting. the guy she was interested in wasn't a guy at all is just comforting, period, and it’s also the quickest, most bite-sized read on busy days. romance 101 has its own special kind of warmth. my reason to d*e is a bit more serious, but the art is very pretty, and the chemistry and foreshadowing keeps you invested. if you’re okay to read some really questionable nsfw scenes (i can say from experience that you can breeze through most of them and still get the most out of the story), red candy is like experiencing a really melodramatic kdrama from the 2010s. undercover spy trope, honey trap, location changes in different seasons, dramatic g*n fights and car chases, dramatic goodbyes, dramatic reunions, dramatic rescues, dramatic confessions, dramatic miscommunication. like. it’s literally a modern day soap opera. that’s not to say it’s not decently written in its own way, bc the fun with it is that if you want to talk seriously about it, i have lots of thoughts, but if you want to poke fun at it, i also have lots of thoughts. i get very rambly about it, as you can see. it awakens the weekday afternoon telenovela-with-low-ratings enthusiast that my ancestors have passed down to me. <br><br>but anyway more big-picture, action-driven ones are omniscient reader and sss-class revival hunter! purple hyacinth is an interesting read if only bc it has beautiful music to go along with the story! in the bleak midwinter is probably the closest to a holistic popular webtoon out there that i’ve touched and isn’t adapted from a novel! park taejoon is my parasocial enemy but all his works have so much stuff going on that you almost want to keep reading purely for the derangement of how the premise spiraled into what the story has become! i’m gonna stop right here but i hope at least one of this is worth checking out for you and i’m sorry for the long reply to such a straightforward question!</div>

 <div class=reply>my thoughts are probably heavily informed by the fact that my closest friend from high school to our early 20s is a textbook infj, and all those years of friendship means i’ve had to be vulnerable around her, even if i don’t think i ever really let my guard down as to be knowable beyond small details — but the small details mean a lot, and to me marks infjs. they don’t pry, they don’t push, they don’t intrude, but they do orbit around you, and if you give them surface level knowability, they’ll consider that the whole truth, but i don’t hold it against them. when it comes down to it, i think infjs value themselves more than they value anyone else, no matter what they might say informs their desire to connect with other people. they’re interior people who want to make the interiority external, and it works in some cases, not quite others; i tend to watch them go off to attach to people who can help with that externalizing even if they’re the wrong sort to attach to. i often think infjs are better off acknowledging their own selfcentredness; it’s not a bad word, and i don’t think they should feel bad for being self-centred. the infjs i know have tried so hard to claw away from their own self by insisting they just want to love someone, but there’s no harm in embracing that sometimes the need to love someone only ever comes down to wanting to be loved first and foremost.<br><br>what else… hmm i know for a fact there’s a sphere of introspection that i feel comfortable inhabiting around infjs? i can trade thoughts with them. i am always open to listening to their thoughts. the warmest love i’ve ever received has been from infjs, even if it was never love that made me feel less alone in my thoughts and emotions. they try to be there for other people. they try to emit love indiscriminately, with enough self-awareness that you can’t begrudge them any instance where their love languages or introspectiveness might clash with yours. to me, infjs are defined by their endless attempts, whether it’s this need to be validated by the world or to love you in the way they understand to be love or creative pursuits. it’s an earnest variation on what i might call resilience on other people, and i admire it, especially bc i know i can trust infjs to at least have visible, tangible layers to even impulsive choices. there’s always a motivation somewhere, even if they’re not honest about it. so they’re easy to understand, and therefore easy to love. <br><br>infjs and i have just enough in common that disagreement is pretty much impossible, let alone straight up animosity, but that also means we kinda just exist parallel to each other in this little sphere of intuitive existence, you know? i never have to justify myself to an infj. they never have to justify themselves to me. so. if love was a limbo. that’s me and infjs.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no that context is super helpful! alongside 1899, yellowjackets and the bear from my previous answer, the kdramas the good detective + summer strike as well as the tv show adaptation of irma vep come to mind. i assume you also might have already seen my liberation notes and extraordinary attorney woo based on this list, but i’ll throw the names in anyway. one of my fav shows of all time is also please like me, which i think balances humour and more “sensitive” topics well. but current tv is def not a playing field i know well, and i’m sorry i can’t be of clearer / more niche help 😞</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooooh what counts as interesting? are we thinking twisty what the hell is going on type of interesting? in which case i think dark and 1899 are both very layered in that capacity. or were we aiming for more anthological like black mirror’s format? both love, death &amp; robots and guillermo del toro’s cabinet of curiosities have more misses than hits but the episodes that do it right do it quite memorably. or more slice of life romcom like hometown cha cha cha? action packed and revenge driven like my name? documentary-esque like abstract the art of design or informative talk show-esque with a touch of comedy like patriot act? i also realize all of these are n*tflix shows damn but i did hear that the new interview with the vampire show (amc) is fun + i know quite a handful of people who will ride to the sunset for yellowjackets (hbo), a league of their own (prime) and the bear (disney+)<br><br>shows i’ve personally enjoyed lately also include hacks (hbo), weak hero class 1 (viki), and dimension 20’s neverafter campaign (dropout), but i don’t think i should be an arbiter of taste when it comes to tv so big big Big emphasis on personally 🤞🏼</div>

 <div class=reply>editing this answer a bit bc the clunky wording has been haunting me the past couple days but first — the other novel is sss-class su*cide/revival hunter, which also has a manhwa and which i love very, very dearly !!<br><br>i can’t find the link for it for some reason god but i think bidokja on tumblr words the difference between that novel and orv best: “i wouldn't necessarily say one is objectively better than the other because they are telling two different stories in different ways […] but sssrh is like....better writing? or at the very least its much less Blunt writing than ORV tends to do. they get their themes across using very different writing styles and i have to say i personally prefer sssrh's style to orv's. [...] like. i genuinely think that the difference cannot be accounted for only by the varying translation quality. that may play a part but hmmm. where orv feels like sudden stabs, sssrh feels like a clean slice. where orv feels like a torrential downpour, sssrh feels like a warm shower with ozone crackling in the air. where orv feels like a desperate sprint, sssrh feels like a determined climb.” <br><br>which i only bring up to say that my opinion on orv Has changed but also not? i feel a lot for it, and i’ve quite enjoyed talking to people about it bc there’s so much in it that’s so delicious to just ping pong in conversations that devolve into everyone urgently going all caps. but i also think that endless capacity to be discussed reflects a lot of — not faults, definitely, but parts of orv that’s enjoyed best with company and lots of real estate to explore and chew, if that makes sense. it hits hard, i think the story is incredibly fun and heartrending in equal measure, while also being reflective of a wider canon. familiar tropes are there, and its brilliance is in the level of metafiction-esque narrativizing it accomplishes with room to spare. it takes conventions and traditions and storytelling terms we universally know and mashes it into this fun, action-y romp that essentially boils down to wow! the power of stories! until the sheer pang of that thesis breaks you and its generously written characters apart. but it’s weird bc what i do love about it is more. indirect. i marvel at it, and it has broken my heart as someone who has loved stories as both reader &amp; writer, and it has tugged at both my heartstrings &amp; neural synapses, but there’s also a certain coldness that comes over me when i think about it critically. again, it’s weird. but there’s also sincere appreciation there.<br><br>i think enjoying orv is best enjoyed with what you bring to it and how it speaks to you. it’s a love letter to storytelling so earnest that it tackles the physics of how far you can take the dynamic bw real life and stories, but it can be anything from clever to cruel to crude depending on your own rs with all that it encompasses. i know that’s a non-answer when it’s such a daunting length, but it really, truly depends.</div>

 <div class=reply>i am so giddy to be asked hehe but the answer isn’t actually very interesting 😞 i think i just happened to consume a lot of recent media that dealt with it in some form. started early this year with sss class revival hunter, then i read a few of anne carson’s tragedy translations and retellings / adaptations of ancient tales are just looping / inevitability at its best. i watched the nge rebuilds and realized that every timeline is a devilmanesque loop for kaworu, &amp; when i brought that up the last time i talked to my brother, he mentioned the endless eight, which is an eight episode time loop in an anime we watched as kids and governed our lives for a while. quite recently i read recursion by blake crouch, and a bit before that, i was reading up on time loops bc it was the original plan i had for an au i wrote this year, until i decided alternate timelines was the way to go. but the seed has been planted and i can’t stop thinking about it bc it is applicable Everywhere once you start. i’ve also just always been fond of cyclicality in writing, and someone pointed out that even in my earliest works on my current ao3 account, you can see me experimenting with looping a story back to the beginning. so now as i wrestle with an original project that’s more explicitly related to my own trauma, i’m hellbent on finding a way to not be so literal about both the trauma and the cyclicality. i guess you can also consider my interest symptomatic of the multiverse moment that pop culture is going through rn, in that the main figure for the idea of the time loop is sisyphus, and i don’t think any mythological figure better sums up what it’s like living in the world these days. and regressors have the sisyphus element built in. i didn’t stand a chance against this spiral, really. <br><br>but recs !! yes !! i don’t really Love love a lot of time loop hollywood movies, but video games are the best at the job. this is my fav video on that, but i’m also biased towards jacob: https://youtu.be/dZrEayPIrVE<br><br>here are a couple others: <br><br>https://youtu.be/CI-4cumMC-Y<br>https://youtu.be/QWEVGbVoxQ4<br><br>also i think no one does regressors like manhwa / korean web novels, so if you’re down for a long ride, sssrh (see above) + omniscient reader’s viewpoint both have them. if you read one novel with a time loop / regression element, the blake crouch novel i mentioned above is Nuts. anime wise, steins gate is pretty much The time loop big name, and for good reason. <br><br>there are also these newsletters: <br><br>https://literateleah.substack.com/p/issue-forty-nine<br>https://katy.substack.com/p/time-loop-narratives-are-about-love<br><br>and not explicitly about time loops but this is a good approach to the sisyphean nature of even the media we have rn: https://reallifemag.com/nostalgia-for-nostalgia/?utm_source=pocket_mylist<br><br>running out of space and i’ll prob kick myself when i remember more later, but thank you so much for being the first person to ask me about my brainrot :(</div>

 <div class=reply>the way this cc made me do a choked out sigh and i haven’t even had a first love… ahhh how do we go about this :( <br><br>i think i’m hesitating bc i don’t really know if there’s a right answer. what i do know, or at least what i think, is that a first anything is one of the only things in life that is made special just by the fact that it happened. that’s very cheesy, but i can’t find another way to put it. i think with the last time we do most things, there will always be a small possibility that we can make it not the last one, but with first things, and especially first loves, it will always carry that label. and i think that’s what makes it so hard, and even more that you’re only seventeen. i think the world matters More, if anything, when you’re seventeen. you’re young and the world is still the size of your life, and so when something shatters that life, it leaves cracks the size of the world. and i won’t tell you that this doesn’t matter in the bigger picture of your life even though technically it doesn’t, and a few years from now, who knows if you’ll even remember this exact feeling — nor will i tell you that it matters, bc idk if it does, either. but also i don’t think it matters if it matters. the first instinct when we feel something big is to be like, is it good that i feel this way? is it bad? how do i get rid of it? bc in “dealing” with something, we always assume we can only do that by making it go away or fixing it. as for that, i don’t really have any advice. i don’t think heartbreak really goes away, ever, whether first breakups or growing up and away from old friends, and the more life you live, the more you have to lose in a way beyond your control. so i think my advice would be, and i know how unhelpful it is, to just… keep going. like i know how stupid that is even just typing it out but the older i get, the more i cannot overemphasize the importance of allowing yourself a life in a world that’s crumbling. get up in your crumbled world with your broken heart and find things to distract you. go out with friends and maybe you can’t laugh quite yet but keep doing it and eventually something will give. find something to obsess over, a piece of media or a celebrity or a new hobby. find new people to talk to. move to a different city. no one’s asking you to replace your first love, but the bigger the world you live in, the better it becomes equipped to distribute the weight of the perpetual heartbreak we’re all carrying. i’m sorry that i can’t give you anything better than a variation on Time Will Heal, but i’m squeezing your hands very tightly. i’m sorry to hear about your breakup. i hope you are taking care of yourself. i hope the world brings you triple the number more to love in the future, and give you back all the love you give to it.</div>

 <div class=reply>it hasn’t, really! i’ll always be a the goldfinch &gt; tsh guy, i think, but i was thinking the other day about how i wrote a paper in high school about the level of characterization in tsh. i think i said something about how the greek class doesn’t pass most of our basic expectations of a decent, dimensional character, and i still agree with that, but a caveat i didn’t acknowledge back then that i would now is that they were deliberately written to be cardboard suggestions of people from richard’s perspective. i probably said this in the yt video, i can’t remember, but it’s exactly bc tartt mastered the whole Real But Implausible But Somehow Tangible Through These Ridiculous Details method of sketching out characters that they’re all so suited for this trend of making everything into aesthetics like coquette or dark academia. but that’s really all the characters are. they’re figments of embodied aesthetic, rendered in motion or flattened according to richard’s motives, and it’s what makes him a nice little romantic of an unreliable narrator. that unreliability and the allure that shapes it is the whole point of tsh. at least to me. in that, i think it’s a pretty foolproof novel in terms of cultivating atmosphere and tone, but in terms of themes and alive-ness, the goldfinch is to me the better, more solid book by far. but no, i still like tsh for the reasons i always have, and just bc it’s been co-opted by dark academia doesn’t really change that initial opinion.</div>

 <div class=reply>i am placing a hand on your shoulder. hello. my friend. just between you and me, i will say this: if i ever write a blue lock fic, bachira/isagi will be in it. that, i can promise you. i can’t actually promise the blue lock fic. i think i told the last cc that asked about blue lock that i don’t know if i’ve ever thought about what i’d write for it, and that’s still true for the most part. but. if ever. i’m sure i’ll find my way to bachira/isagi. maybe rin will be involved. bc the itoshi brothers dynamic and all that. i’ve also kinda always wanted to explore the dynamic between them three. or maybe i’ll just write shenanigans between isagi, bachira, chigiri &amp; nagi. who knows. but also look at me i’m already going against what i just said about not thinking about what i’d write 😐</div>

 <div class=reply>i used to wait for someone to upload the new chapter on a site specifically for raws but i think that site got nuked, so for the past couple of months i’ve just been using leftover coins on comic-days to read new chapters the day it drops, so i’m not much help beyond that, i’m afraid :( i’m not really sure what the status is on translating the chapters, but a mutual did kindly let me know it’s up to date on bat*t* (that’s an o in place of the asterisks, if you’re not familiar with the site). i’m sure you can look up blp there and find translations by the team that took over from the last one. idk if they have strict timelines for uploads, but last i checked, they had up to 56.</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m caught up to 47! i don’t know if you wanted my thoughts on anything in particular (or if that’s conceited of me to assume), but overall sukirofa just hasn’t failed me. it’s done everything i expect and need it to, and it’s handled shima with as much delicacy as it can without hammering us over the head with all the nuances of his personality and upbringing. he’s a very easy character to understand, and i value that the series doesn’t do more than what we already have. sukirofa is always sparse and simple but it’s not subtle, and i think that’s a really difficult perfect balance to consistently sustain yet it always manages. yasaka is also one of my new fav tertiary? secondary? characters? i think “you must have received plenty of love, to be able to not care how others see you” might be the single best piece of dialogue i’ve read all year. tsubame club translated it so well as always. i love it so much. i love it so much that sometimes my gut churns with envy that i didn’t write it, which almost never happens anymore. just. i trust sukirofa with my heart, and it hasn’t done anything but hold it like a golden retriever holds a soft boiled egg in their mouth.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have not until this cc actually !! i took it and the results i got felt very fair, and i imagine it would be useful for relationships where people don’t really know what’s working and what isn’t. the thing here though is that… i feel like this is applicable to any test / personality typology that gives you an overview of how you process things, but it’s meant to be a guide, right? and at the end of the day, it’s not really about a loveprint so much as your ability to understand yourself and the other person and foster understanding between yourselves. the loveprint is a very, very useful device as a starting point, but i feel about it how i feel about most of jubilee’s offerings on their channel: it’s just a surface introduction. no less useful for it, but it’s not doing the bulk of the crucial work. at best, it shows people how much they don’t know about this or that, and the hope is that you move forward with that information, but at worst, it sensationalizes and aestheticizes something much more superficial than like. the multitudes of a human being’s whole personality and lived experience. that’s not me being cynical, either. i love personality tests, and i think this one’s pretty cool, but — you know. stomaching a video of conservatives finding middle ground with liberals isn’t any more politically groundbreaking in the grander scheme of things than finding out that you’re a person who needs to not spend every waking second with your partner will magically save a relationship on the brink bc of a slew of other factors, you know what i mean? i also just tend to worry about this trend? this tendency? this desire, even? to make our lives and personalities into content and consumer goods. i see it in sites like we’re not really strangers and jubilee. it’s very discouraging to see, but that’s a me thing, and it’s a different tangent altogether. i thought the test was fun, and it’s always super cool when something gets added into my Personality Pantheon and agrees with my enneagram, mbti and natal chart, etc.</div>

 <div class=reply>the emojis feel like i’m under a spotlight oh god but infp-ts are… probably not the best people to be around me, and i say that firstly to mean that infps in general are better off not being around someone with my disposition. it’s just a surface incompatibility, i think. obv there would be infps i get along with and infps i don’t get along with, but i just don’t think true, immense love is possible between us bc true, immense understanding isn’t possible, at least on my end. and to be clear i’m saying the fault would likely fall on me. i just… struggle to find affection for people who are more abstracted in their approach to life, or — in my view — easily swayed by things i find needless, whether that might be subjective emotions in an objective situation or vice versa or something else like friendship or romance or personal attachment to even mundane things. i like people who are steady and grounded, decisive, resilient to a fault but unlikely to form their identity around something i’ll find narrow and maybe even unfairly superficial — which is kinda. the opposite. of what infps tend to gravitate towards. their level of introspection and empathy and their capacity to feel their own emotions is their strength, is what makes them who and what they are, but the very nature and quality of that would also probably be what will weigh on me and wear me out. i tend to feel magnetized towards people who are able to efficiently but generously navigate their lives and their thoughts, whatever that might look like, and i also like people who have the ability to be steady and reliable, neither of which are adjectives i’ll attach to infps. many infps are gentle, and they’re loving by nature, and their creativity is something to benefit and learn from; plenty of things make infps so good to have around for most, i imagine, and i don’t doubt that, but baggage is baggage to me. if i can help it, i wouldn’t want to have to travel with it. i also know it’s unfair to expect everyone to be independent and self sufficient and not bleed their feelings out into the world, and it’s ironic/hypocritical for me to recoil from it when i deal in human lives and emotions in like. literal writing, but i like my space, physical and emotional and mental. infps feel like they intrude on that space even when they do not mean to, and it feels like being physically touched when i don’t want to be, if that makes sense. i don’t hold it against them. they have a boundless capacity for affection and kindness i admire and respect and want to reciprocate via my own methods. it’s nothing hostile at all, either. metaphorically (and literally) speaking, i don’t like to be hugged. infps, metaphorically, are huggers. that’s all.</div>

 <div class=reply>I KNOW THIS WASN’T AN URGENT QUESTION OR ANYTHING BUT I AM STILL DEEPLY SORRY I LEFT IT UNANSWERED FOR SO LONG I WILL CATCH UP ON CCS NOW AND I HOPE YOU ARE ALSO DOING WELL <br><br>but ooooh elena ferrante !! i say this as one of the highest forms of complimenting her possible but i can’t name a single writer more difficult for me to stomach without wanting to vomit the emptiness the writing leaves in my gut. it isn’t even that ferrante’s work is especially sad by nature more so that there’s a kind of probing melancholy that’s innate to how they weave their narratives and character dynamics (their relationships are always so, So loaded to read and doubly so when you’re feeling extra emotionally sensitive) and themes. maybe that’s more bc of the things they write about — female friendships, female conflicts, all these complex layers that are honestly pretty stressful to read if you start sympathizing or empathizing too much — than it is about their style of writing, necessarily, but still. they’re a very hard writer for me to read. it feels like getting slapped in the face gently but repeatedly, so that the sting and the redness builds up to something you have to recoil from at some point. and also like summer depression. i don’t think i’ve been able to sit through an entire ferrante book without getting nauseous, but that’s prob bc i have like. an allergic reaction. to specific emotions, and those emotions are what the neapolitan novels got out of me in hs without fail. i also find that i feel the same about adaptations of ferrante’s work, though? like, i tried watching the hbo show for my brilliant friend and also the lost daughter, and it’s the same kinda. gooey helplessness. or maybe hopelessness. idk. i think i tried reading the original italian at one point as well and it was the same. it’s just the Vibes, you know?<br><br>some writers make you feel like crap and you’re like wow how are you doing this, but with ferrante, i can never read for even objective pleasure, whether direct or roundabout. i wonder if i’ll feel differently if i tried reading my brilliant friend now, but idk. it’s a thing so exclusive to ferrante that i’ve never thought about it any further than god i can’t do it i can’t read this i feel like i’ll d*e if i read on. i also recall listening to the cut podcast’s episode on elena ferrante a few years ago + barry jenkins &amp; greta gerwig’s a24 podcast episode together where she briefly brings up the neapolitan novels while talking about lady bird, and i think… i think it’s just a collective vibe that embraces people differently, and for me, it’s the kind of embrace i’d really rather shun bc it puts me in such a difficult emotional position. then again, i’m not known for my ability to be comfortably vulnerable on a personal level. maybe this is something to unpack.</div>

 <div class=reply>never before did i think this is a question i’ll someday receive and reflect on and i love it<br><br>i don’t even know how i’d begin answering something so unexpected ?? omg ?? i guess i’d say that a wisdom tooth would have a few things to tell you about how there is a point where holding onto something you’ve always had for the sole reason that it’s always been there and doesn’t actively deal you harm is just more damaging to you than otherwise. a wisdom tooth would probably know better than anyone what it’s like to have to let go after reaching a certain age, whether or not that age is actually a marker of adulthood; a wisdom tooth would know that there arrives a stage in life where you have to have it taken out, and your face will be so swollen for some time after and you’ll have quite a bit of difficulty eating anything, but that will subside and you won’t even feel the loss at all unless you think about it, licking the back of your mouth where those molars used to be, where you think you can still taste the blood that was there when they pulled it out and the cotton they shoved in after. and so i think a wisdom tooth would look at all the conversations we have now — about parenting the inner child in us, about holding on and loving them the way they might never have been loved, about ending the cycle starting with ourselves — and it would gently say, “yes, of course. of course you must do that. but eventually, you’ll have to let that child rest, too. they can’t take the wheel and drive life for you. you can’t keep holding on and endangering the rest of your life just to hold onto them longer, just as you can’t really deny having your wisdom teeth taken out if it means avoiding future complications with the rest of your teeth. sometimes, it’s the things that take up space with the sheer mass of possibility, even if they remain benign, that stop us from achieving true comfort. and you have to let them take me out if they say it’s time.” it’s like a little grandma, in my head, the wisdom tooth. a little grandma on a rocking chair, knitting something by the fire, smiling warmly at you even as she doles out hard to hear advice. but she’ll hug you after and she’ll smell like tea, and you’ll know she’s right, that eventually you come of age and it’s hard when you weren’t even given room to be a child, but the things that weren’t meant to last forever, let alone govern your life, must be let go of when it’s time, and that you’re always more ready for that moment than you feel.</div>

 <div class=reply>INTERESTING no i don’t think we were ever asked to dress up as anything, really 🤔 could be the whole catholic school business, but truth be told idk what i would have dressed up as so i’m a bit grateful now. though this is also tripping me out wow idk if i’ve ever wanted to be anything, professionally speaking, even as a child ?? <br><br>i have some ideas now of what my child self could have wanted to be if they’d been given room to want things — an architect, an astrophysicist, a teacher / professor — but i’d be lying if i said they wanted much, that child me. i wasn’t a kid with much lofty ambition… or really any aspirations. not necessarily in the sad way or anything. i’ve just never envisioned ownership of my life in that capacity, or thought it possible. probably i would have dressed up as a catholic nun. the routine of the benedictine sisters who ran my school was very attractive to me: quiet, rote, no going out necessary, spare time to read. i’ve been told since that i just didn’t want to unpack the whole liking girls thing and also thought my inability to feel romantic attraction meant i was destined for a life of servitude to a god whose existence was a moot point to the attractiveness of religious rituals, but honestly, if the life of a catholic nun was actually as idyll as i thought it was, and if not for the celibacy and waking up at ungodly hours thing, i’d still go for that now. it was more a rational career choice than a call to god, if you know what i mean sjsds anyway the tl;dr is i’d dress kid me up in a nun’s habit or maybe some teacher-ly office clothes</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha&lt;3 you mentioned previously that you struggled with social anxiety, and i struggle greatly with it too. i was just wondering if there was a certain time you found that making friends was easier, and if you wouldn’t mind sharing the ways of how you got comfortable enough to get there, i’d really love to listen. <br>i have very kind people around me, but i don’t offer much in conversations, and i know what i lack in humor or presence, i make up in sincerity. but even knowing this, i guess sometimes it doesn’t feel enough. <br>i recently deleted all my social media accounts, turned off iMessages, and kinda just went off the grid. i’m trying to become a better self that people would be proud to be friends with. i guess i’d just like to hear your thoughts as someone who’s also struggled with social anxiety and as someone who’s graduated college— i feel like i Have to be social in this point of my life because that’s when it matters most, and college is the easiest social setting you can get. i don’t know, 20s are hard. <br>please ignore this if it’s too much. i don’t mean to dump my troubles on you. <br>i hope you’re taking it easy, and i hope the hardships of your 20s have mellowed out a bit&lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, i know, i know, i know… just — everything. i know what you mean. i know it’s weird to share your feelings and hear this from someone but truly, i’ve been there. am still there, really. at the bookstore earlier i had a split second of genuinely contemplating stealing the book i wanted to buy bc i needed it badly but felt like i’d be sick at the thought of having to interact with the cashier. obv i felt silly for thinking i’d rather do something ILLEGAL than exchange two minutes of rote conversation, but. there it is. i thought of this cc, earlier. bc i’m def much better than i was just a few years ago but i’d be lying if i said social anxiety has just gotten magically easier even with mental healthcare i know i was lucky to receive. there are good days and bad days. moments i’m more equipped and moments i feel like i’ll throw up or lose it over something that i know rationally will end fine. i think i’ve kind of accepted that it will always be like that in some corners of my life, and that’s fine. it will always be over, eventually, is what i tell myself. <br><br>i think the most i could do in your situation was to make things smaller. not narrower, but smaller. with anxiety, we tend to catastrophize, where we imagine possible outcomes and fear them bc they’re so big and disastrous. what if they think i’m stupid, etc. and the worst possibility is never out of the question, but i’ve managed it mostly by sticking to one on one things. if i had to network in uni, i focused more on small talk with a seatmate, or talking to a prof just one on one instead of in a setting where there are other people. it’s like taking smaller bites. always bite less than you know you can chew, and focus on savouring that bite. it’s better to take small bites that amount to a full stomach. i say this gently but social interactions are never as deep as people expect and at times want to be; social connections are a diff matter. so if i couldn’t say smth to a friend earlier bc i couldn’t speak up, i’ll muster up the courage to write them a little note instead. do things that feel manageable to you, &amp; focus on being in the moment. social acts don’t have to be grand. there are always alternatives. you can get creative. emailing a prof with a question instead of raising your hand in class, or complimenting a stranger’s shirt and leaving it at that. things that feel less strictly social, bc it’s just an email or it’s not a convo, but they still matter. <br><br>idk if this makes sense, and i know there’s nothing really i can say that will be practical and helpful. just know i’m cheering you on, and that i hope you’re taking it easy as well. 20s ARE hard. but i don’t doubt your sincerity as a friend, kind and earnest as this cc is, and there’s nothing wrong with finding non traditional ways to convey that sincerity.</div>

 <div class=reply>it was orpheus and eurydice! that one wasn’t all that fleshed out compared to the others, but the inspiration i was working off was a mix of eurydice by sarah ruhl and a few songs from the musical hadestown. i think the orpheus and eurydice myth gets a bad rep for being a story about human folly, or inability to resist or trust, but to me it’s a mix of doubting himself worthy enough to be followed by her and loving her too much to not turn around. why is it stupidity for him to want to turn around? would he have followed her down to hell if she didn’t mean so much that to turn around is muscle memory? <br><br>and hadestown has eurydice as a bit of the calmer, quieter, sharp-edged type while orpheus is sweeter, softer, but i think megumi has the makings of a really good orpheus. or at least an orpheus that explores what i see in him. orpheus who’s the son of morpheus, like in neil gaiman’s the sandman. canon megumi has already devoted himself to stopping the deaths of people he can save, especially someone like yuuji or tsumiki; it’s what makes him tick, his own handmade system for the world, yet it’s at odds with his own relationship with his own death, which he plays at with an almost resignation that yuuji notices very early on. i think he says something about how megumi just looked like he accepted his death. and there’s so much you can play with there, about how megumi’s personal values had been enough to save yuuji, a stranger he met less than two hours ago, from execution. none of these themes i really had the chance to play with in any of the fics i’ve written for jjk. <br><br>the myth goes that when eurydice passed, orpheus sang with so much grief in an attempt to bring her to life — and it’s like. i don’t want to see that as a quiet, mournful song-cry. i want to see it as someone raising hell (or going down to it) bc he lost someone he had sworn not to leave to be claimed by death. megumi has so much personal responsibility written in who he is, and whether or not he’s aware himself, it affects a lot of his dynamic with yuuji, who’s much more perceptive than people give him credit for. what would yuuji do, in a situation where megumi has come to retrieve him past his time? looking at yuuji’s trial with higuruma and his own relationship with personal responsibility, what would it look like to be eurydice? <br><br>as you can see though it’s more stray insubstantial thematic thoughts than anything written 😅 whatever i have on the doc are just. versions of these thoughts. i think. it’s been a while. i don’t know. i still think there’s lots of meat to work with here, but to be fair, yuuji has hardly been in the series up until recently, so i haven’t really had many adjustments to make in my head. <br><br>but anyway! thank you for paying such close attention and remembering :)</div>

 <div class=reply>you know... funnily enough, i can't quite say never about these two. like. no matter where i stand with jjk, if ever something happens and i feel something strike, i have no doubt in my mind i still have it in me to write them. that’s not me concretely promising anything, but they do still make me feel in their own way, and if ever those feelings want to go somewhere and i’m in the position to listen, i know i will.</div>

 <div class=question>hello please ignore if this is too personal of a question but i remember a long while ago you answered someone’s cc on what sort of mental health care you got over the years and i was wondering how all of it interfered with uni/school and how you managed it? if the timelines even crossed, i’m not sure, i just remembered and im in a similar place myself and you exude comfort and understanding so i thought id ask; again, if it’s too personal i can either dm you or you can disregard the entire cc, no pressure!! thank you and love you!!</div>

 <div class=reply>no no i don’t mind at all, but tysm for considering my boundaries! <br><br>in my specific case, i’ve struggled with social anxiety my whole life, and depression set in around 14, but i was very resistant to psychiatric care all the way until things came to a boil in my second year of uni. there were a lot of stops and starts with various mental health facilities; kinda just delayed getting help bc i was functioning pretty well even with severe anxiety and depression, and that was all that mattered to me. i didn’t really receive care until things got quite extreme, so in some ways, the mental health had already interfered with school before the healthcare did. <br><br>but i actually had to do five years of uni! these last three years have seen my mental health at its most trouble-making, and that required a lot of trials and errors in terms of getting treatment. meds, therapy, all of which i had to explore outside school and my job and my extracurriculars. not to mention therapy and medication of all kinds took a physical toll i wasn’t accounting for in my daily life. i had to go straight to class after four hours of cbt one year, and it helped me a lot, but it wasn’t the best at the time. i found myself going part-time some semesters, or choosing classes for my own interest instead of either of my majors bc that made school more bearable. i indulged myself a lot, and i don’t think that’s a bad thing, but it’s one of those parts where… if i had gotten help sooner, could i have managed the amount of interference better? i also know that there were plenty of times i chose life over receiving care. i refused to take meds that would make me too sleepy for class, refused therapy i needed bc the timeslot didn’t work for my job. and that wasn’t wise, in retrospect. <br><br>i don’t know your situation and i don’t mean to assume, and it’s not like you asked me for advice, but i will say that — if you find yourself in a position where help sounds good, trust your body and your feelings and just prioritize it. your life is there to be lived by you, but if you don’t feel very “you” right now, then life can wait until you do. yeah, it might make some things trickier bc you disrupt the timeline that everyone else follows, but still. it will be okay. and if there’s a mental health care person overseeing what care you receive and you don’t totally vibe with something, if at all possible, you can be transparent. doctors know a lot of things, but they’re not experts on your life, &amp; i’ve found that when you’re honest and nudge them to accommodate the life you of course still want to have, a lot of them will At Least offer options, which i feel is crucial since it’s Your care.<br><br>i hope i answered your question ?? if you have any other qs or you just want a place to dump your thoughts on any of this, my inbox is always open !!</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! I've always been too honest of a person so I have to acknowledge that I did send you an ask fairly recently. I feel a little bad for writing you again so soon but I don't know if I'll be able to sleep without sending this. I was revisiting your jjk fics tonight and it made me realize I hadn't seen you talk about in awhile. I'd been reading the manga myself, but lost interest not to long ago, so I felt like I knew your answer, and then my suspicions were confirmed when I found it on here. it still hurts though, of course not to put any blame on you, but just to see what it's become. I'm really no good with analysis, I just read it, so I won't try to do it here. but all the themes that you touched on in your fics, the ones that you made me realize jjk had and that I yearned for, just feel so missing in the current arcs. I don't even really know what's going on, or the point of what's going on. it's so painful to see everything that it felt like it was building up just go away. I don't get the point of it anymore. alright, okay. I don't know how to transition to this, but I don't like just dumping my feelings in an ask and I don't blame you if don't have much to see on jjk, so I also wanted to ask you what your thoughts on chainsaw man were?? I hope I can take some of the pressure of by saying I'm struggling to enjoy it. it definitely isn't bad, not at all, but I've seen so many people migrate from jjk to it but I'm really struggling to feel the same connection to it. I don't know, maybe I'm putting too much pressure on it, or maybe it's just not for me, but I just don't feel like it's awakening anything within me. I don't know. I don't dislike denji, and I've definitely enjoyed main characters that don't have like, the typical main character qualities (selflessness, human sunshine, etc) but I also think I can't stop comparing him to Yuji in my head, which is a hard comparison. I've never seen you talk about it before, so I'm guessing the answer might just be it's not for you. but I'd love to hear even that, or whatever else you've got. anyways, thank you so much for flls. I think even if jjk stays where it is now, I will be able to carry yuji and Megumi in my pocket for a long time. (ps awhile ago I was always calling itadori yuji and I realized it's 100% because of how much you refer to him as that in first love late spring. I usually correct it, but wanted you to see that here) okay, really, goodbye now! please stay safe out there and have a good week</div>

 <div class=reply>i talked about csm a bit here, actually! https://curiouscat.me/sleeptowns/post/1284051338<br><br>the gist is that i love it. the manga, at least. the anime, i’m teetering between apathy &amp; burgeoning annoyance at a slew of things. either way my csm stance is that it’s a great little work, but also that fujimoto is yet to fully settle into the medium and it’s exciting to watch it in progress. with that in mind, i do think he’s more concerned with ideas and symbolic placeholders than he is your typical characterization. he loves his explorations of meanings &amp; their representations. some people are very in love with this bc it leaves so much room for nuance in loving the characters, i am a fan only of how he does it, but it certainly doesn’t fall in line with shounen genre tradition. so imo the fact that people migrate from jjk to csm just for Something is more damaging in the long run in consuming either work; you’re trapped in what one could be &amp; run into danger of not seeing the other for what it is. and i think csm deserves better than to be a substitute for a work that its themes and narrative outweigh. it’s not fair to either series. <br><br>on that note, and i’m saying this to you with as much gentleness as possible, i’m not sure i ever had as much faith in jjk. it’s a series where the potential trumps what it offers not bc it falls short but bc it doesn’t know what it wants. my interest in jjk has always been about affection for specific characters, and if nothing else, i think i’ve always had a sense of what kind of creator akutami sensei is. and they just happen to have diff priorities than what i like to be invested in long term. a part of me knows for a fact i wrote all the fics i did for jjk bc they were things that canon would never hand to me. if they were, if it was only a matter of time until these themes were explored, i prob wouldn’t have been spurred to write the content i did. <br><br>but i understand you, and i’m sorry. &amp; thank you, still, for finding your way to jjk and to flls. cheesy as it sounds, i don’t regret the time i spent with jjk. i owe a lot to flls &amp; the people, anonymous and otherwise, that i’ve met through jjk. but i think you’re completely justified in feeling hurt by it all. no matter how you look at it, jjk’s tone has massively diverged. when you form a relationship with a story and for whatever reason, good or bad, it becomes a different person altogether — ofc it will feel personal. so. i get it. i really do. behind me are a whole pile of stories i loved more for what it could be than what it is. it’s rough, as silly as it might seem to word to someone else. so i’m squeezing your hand very tight. <br><br>you take care out there as well, and don’t ever feel bad for writing me multiple times ❣️</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t know if it’s been long enough for my current thoughts to be — not too fresh, you know what i mean? it’s better to marinate on first opinions, they’re always subject to change, i was also exposed to lots of other takes on it at the moment of consuming, etc. <br><br>but i… it has some hits. it has a lot more misses. a few of the misses have grown on me (anti hero came on the radio today and i sat through the whole of it), while the rest of the hits were strong enough to linger even before the 3am edition dropped (maroon was the first one i ever heard off the album, and it’s attached itself like a leech to an open wound, both healing and… leeching, i guess. and i figured labyrinth would be my fav off the whole album until bigger than the whole sky broke my window down in the middle of the night.) <br><br>i think my overarching issue with midnights is just how disjointed it feels. the strongest themes were the shades of red peppered across all the songs + the idea of a conniving mastermind, but it tended to vacillate between putting either one front and centre vs calling back to other melody lines and/or ideas that don’t really contribute into any encompassing concept in the present. for me, it’s better for an album to be lacklustre as a whole if the idea is solid than for it to be all over the place and for the highs to be as high as the lows are low. that’s all. <br><br>i was also telling a friend that my fav section is the ending verse in mastermind, and how much i would have loved if we stuck to that character/concept the whole way through. i’ve already seen hints of the vengeance that propels songs like anti hero and vigilante sh*t in reputation, for example, while others were more along the vibes of 1989 and lover. i was hoping midnights was going to be like folklore or evermore in its narrative style, and it would have been quite cool if the album took that idea from mastermind — that this person orchestrated it all, that everything from their first meeting onwards was calculated to become their relationship — and made that the centering narrative. like, if dear reader was the first song (dear reader, if it feels like a trap / you're already in one) and mastermind was the last, where we find out that the love interest has known the whole time (i laid the groundwork / and then saw a wide smirk on your face / you knew the entire time / you knew that i’m a mastermind / and now you're mine). i would have been So down for that. <br><br>but also that’s just me, and i’m not saying i know better than like. a grammy winning artist. or even someone who has more than the limited knowledge i have about taylor swift. really, i just think the album as a whole could have been stronger and more cohesive, but to its credit, the handful of songs i do like, i like a lot.</div>

 <div class=reply>my thoughts on evermore is that i have spent the last year foaming at the mouth for just one novel to embody champagne problems lyric by lyric bc i need it more than i need iron 😞<br><br>no but fr i always have to reiterate that i know close to nothing about any overarching ts lore aside from what two friends have filled me in on, but in my head evermore is a thick sprawling novel following a group of girls who grow up in the same southern town rich for its lumber industry, and the narrative follows them as they grow up, fall in and out of love, move in and out of town, try to get married and fail, try to get married and succeed only for it to disintegrate. some grow apart, others weren’t close as kids but eventually find lifelong friendship in each other as adults. i imagine the first scene of the story is a m*rder happening in town and all the girls recounting their lives with each other for the rest of the album. the genre is southern gothic but the theme is that no one is really the villain in a place this devoid of warmth. that’s like. the lingering idea. that the south is warmer, more beautiful, more alive, and yet these children grow up having to fight for an ounce of love they’re doomed to crush into pieces as dysfunctional adults.<br><br>which. just me projecting my usual onto songs that i’m sure have their own story. there have been a handful of ts songs in the past that i felt for, but i think evermore is the one and only album so far that i feel emotionally connected to as just me, and a lot of that is bc there is so much ache and longing in these lyrics and my brain decided to apply that to a fictional group of friends. champagne problems is about the friend who started dating her bf in hs and everyone thought a happy ending was inevitable but when he proposed she didn’t have it in her to say yes. and that’s where the group starts falling apart: “how evergreen, our group of friends / don’t think we’ll say that word again.” tis the damn season is about the friend who left everyone else to make it big, but she knows she’ll never have the same connection with those “so called friends / who’ll write books about me if i ever make it” than she does with “the only soul who can tell which smiles i’m faking.” and so on. the rest of the album touch upon lost love and both platonic and romantic breakups and reunions and how in the end does it even count for anything that they gave each other warmth once and wasn’t left alone in that sad, cold, beautiful little town? <br><br>i’m at the word limit but didn’t even talk about the music itself i’m very sorry but also i have no thoughts about the technical aspect only vibes and this little internal world so tysm for asking bc this is the first time i’ve had the chance to put all this into (messy) words !!</div>

 <div class=reply>VERY CUTE QUESTION HMM i am particularly fond of four character palindromes. especially four digit even number palindromes like 2002, which i think is a really pretty year to look at. as are the numbers 4114, 6226, 8338. they all look typographically neat. the vibe is straightforward but not too orderly as to be uncompromising like prime or odd numbers sometimes do. i also like four letter palindromes like deed, peep, noon, sees. even less lofty words like poop and boob are cushioned by the inherent prettiness of a four letter palindrome in my eyes. <br><br>and i don’t know if it counts as a palindrome technically but chiasmus is one of my fav language… devices? structures? forms? though more so in latin and ancient greek than english. i guess what i really like in english is phrasal palindromes. antimetaboles like “fail is foul and foul is fair” or “one for all and all for one” feel tidy to me in a way that opens up instead of swallows in. i also use parallel constructions a lot in my writing, though i blame that on latin word order’s long term effects on my prose :] my main point is that i like a good a b b a structure, whether within one word, or one phrase, or even one narrative structure. my stories do tend to end quite circular. so. it’s sweet how short and harmless this question is, yet now you’ve got me realizing i do love palindromes / palindrome-like formats quite a bit.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello and thank u so much for coming by !!! though wow not a question i ever expected to get on here 🫢<br><br>not sure if there’s an existing type of online discourse on this somewhere and if so then i’m not well versed on it, but if you mean my stance on monogamy vs non monogamy in general then all that really matters to me is consent and a balanced dynamic between everyone involved. i think [wrings hands] non monogamy tends to get messy quickly bc people aren’t good at mature communication in your average traditional relationship to begin with, let alone good at what’s beyond that one on one dynamic. often there’s at least one party who gets taken advantage of, or forced to accept preferences that don’t align with their own, and that’s a no go for me. it’s not a relationship if we’re not on equal footing, regardless of whether there’s more than two people involved in this or not. i don’t have patience or sympathy towards cheating pitched under a different label, or power imbalances in relationships whether in regards to career or undernegotiated kinks, whatever else. that’s not what non monogamy is or should be about to me. <br><br>but if everyone is down and no one is being coerced then hell yeah i’ve been known to get behind non monogamy. monogamy as a whole and its place in our societal expectations and traditions is ofc fraught with lots of other things that tie into the patriarchy, the nuclear family idea, all that. on a micro scale i think it’s healthier in the long run to acknowledge that you can have diff sets of feelings for diff people at the same time. i’m also of the opinion that you can’t expect every single one of your needs to be fulfilled by one person. that’s NOT to defend husbands who look for other women bc they Can’t Be Expected To Settle, which is a completely diff matter altogether and one more vile at that. what i mean here is that you can intensely love multiple people in diff ways, or have sexual compatibility with diff people in diff ways, and if there is space and acceptance to safely explore this, then why would i object? <br><br>i’m also aware that i have a rather subjective perception of attraction. there are things i’ll never feel about a romantic partner, and that informs a lot of my views on this. but i’m not blind to the concept of jealousy and how there are genuinely people who will see only a single individual in the entire world as their person. to that, too, why would i object? what it comes down to for me is that everyone has diff needs and all these expectations and traditions we’ve made universal should not get in the way of those needs, but at the same time, any relationship, platonic or romantic, monogamous or not, has one crucial function, and that is to make everyone involved feel cared for and listened to. that’s where the real balance is to me, and if it’s achieved, then lovely. no notes from me.</div>

 <div class=reply>that’s such a fair question! i think 4.5 is as flawless as it gets, and i do consider my 4.5 rated books as perfect works all things considered. it’s just that novels — like any kind of manmade art, granted — involve two human beings on each end, writer and reader, as cringe as it is for me to word it like that ugh, and this dynamic will often have a trace of something that docks off a half star. sometimes it’s something in the book itself, other times it’s a personal preference of mine that i can’t expect one author or genre to universally adhere to. love speech moved me deeply, for example, and to me it’s a perfect little book, but i took off a half star bc i don’t think the academic quotes were as well integrated into the tone of the book as it could have been. did it hurt me enjoying the book? not entirely. but from a technical perspective, it’s still something i felt i should take into consideration. i do add and dock stars according to emotional enjoyment/resonance, which imo is the most important part in any kind of art, but for me and writing specifically, more often than not there will be something technical that pulls a book away from a perfect five to me. not that i’m good enough to be looking down on traditionally published authors, but you know. it’s the principle of the thing. <br><br>and re: ocean vuong, i love how you phrased your question! it really is primarily a matter of his language not reaching me. it’s not that i think he’s overrated or that his work isn’t good. i wholeheartedly respect his relationship with language and his identity, and i’m grateful for the general place he holds in current lit culture. i have enjoyed no small chunk of his work, and do pay attention to his career. but you’re exactly right in how you phrased it. he just doesn’t always reach me. his is a way of writing and putting words to things that doesn’t really ring emotionally for me, but it’s nothing terrible. it’s more like getting a card for your birthday and seeing the prewritten hallmark company message there instead of a friend’s heartfelt, handwritten letter. i can still admire how well written the hallmark message is, and i can appreciate the sentiment behind someone taking the time to find this card to give to me, but it won’t feel as movingly personal to me the way that a letter written by my friend would. everything that makes ocean vuong’s writing raw or tender or bruised or good — it all feels distant from me, like it’s been chosen carefully to seem raw or tender or bruised or good. and ofc every writer chooses their words, that’s what writing is, but i don’t like to notice the thought process as a reader. so i think it’s really that it’s not an emotionally immersive experience for me, reading vuong. but again, it doesn’t take away from the actual, present beauty of the words, and i think you should absolutely give his work a read.</div>

 <div class=reply>kinda tangential but it’s really amazing how many people in my general online vicinity go here omg i’ve dipped in and out a few times before without really latching on but now that i’m trying to commit to reading orv it surprises me every time how popular it seems to be around these parts<br><br>but ahhh i’ve gotten a few dms from both mutuals and non mutuals about orv and i’m trying my best to read and catch up quickly but it hasn’t been a swift seamless process so i don’t really have thoughts to share yet that would matter much :( i’ve been holding off on answering this cc bc i was hoping i’d have read more by the end of this week but that’s a long shot so i’ll sit down with you for now and say that i see why it’s so beloved. i’m not as crazy over it as i am over another web novel turned manhwa that tends to get lumped with orv, but there’s a lot that goes into managing a whole company of characters while spinning a narrative with this level of worldbuilding and spectacle, and to ground that in the simple idea that sometimes a story is enough to save someone’s life is unreal. obv i have a lot left to read, but the parts are all there, and it’s a really interesting take on tying survival with storytelling with kdj, yjh and hsy. it’s a massive “what if…?” that you find in how they’re all connected, occupying the roles that they do in the creation and continuation of wos so !! it’s very interesting for sure. it’s like a thought experiment blown up to the size of an entire universe + theme as ancient and as timeless as stories itself. <br><br>i know this isn’t much considering i’m usually such an i love this character and that character and this dynamic and that arc but i really am not too far in so all i have to offer is this vague thematic hand waving 😭 i have a feeling you’ll see me talk about it on twt if the more personal feelings hit though and i am tentatively promising to be vocal if the time comes</div>

 <div class=reply>i also hope you’re doing well !! and thank you so much for the interest in my media thoughts, rambling as i often are with them. my general book reviews usually go on my literal acc (https://literal.club/regressor/reviews) but whether i’ll do one specifically in the tone of cherry pickings, i.e. theme centric and all that stuff, then yeah for sure 🤔 i don’t have anything in mind at the moment for a potential book focused newsletter and won't say to count on one any time soon, but it’s most certainly a possibility.</div>

 <div class=reply>good literature might be a tall order, i won't lie... i’ve accepted lately how self-indulgent my reading tastes are and i don’t feel ashamed about it at all but i also think i’m not super trustworthy regarding universal standards of quality so please do take this with a grain of salt, as with any recs from me 😅<br><br>that disclaimer aside oooh post-sot would be sometime in the last couple of months, which isn’t a huge time window. i don’t have much, but first thing to come to mind is all down darkness wide by seán hewitt, which is a memoir published last july and has already made quite the impression with its prose. i’ve yet to read the whole thing, and i caution you to read the summary in case the premise might prove a sensitive area, but from what of it i’ve read, i have it stashed away in my mind as one of those books meant to be savoured when life is less emotionally cluttered so i can drown in the language. i’m also reading making love with the land by joshua whitehead, who i’ve recently realized is to me what ocean vuong must be to others, and this one is a book of essays, but if it’s introspection and stunning prose you’re looking for, he’s got you more than covered. and the swimmers by julie otsuka was published a couple months before sot in february 2022, so it might not meet that requirement, but this author is always a really great example of how prose can be at its most beautiful when precision allows it to be sparse, and this novel was highest in my list last year of 2022 books i'm looking forward to.</div>

 <div class=question>your manhwa fics were such a pleasant surprise !! and as always, a work of art &lt;3 especially with the ones in question , they’re both so dear to my heart . especially with pizza delivery man, i feel like you’ve nailed the specific atmosphere of the dialogue and art in the original manhwa .<br><br>on a somewhat related note, i also found myself wondering if you’ve ever seen no home? it isn’t a bl, but its a manhwa especially dear to me, and the different relationship between the main cast, as well as the characters themselves hit me very personally . the themes of loss and family, the high school angst of it all, and the facial expressions !! if you have read it i’d love to hear your thoughts on it, and if you haven’t, i can’t recommend it enough .</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m really, really glad to hear that !! like kicking my feet and giggling and twirling my hair levels of glad, i’m not even kidding. pdm has been such a gentle addition to my weeks this last month — something about having slice of life characters hit so close to home in an age range not too far from me — so i’m relieved to hear i was able to do upi’s art and writing justice somehow. (though i’d say it helped a lot that woowon and seo an are such mature, naturally introspective characters.)<br><br>and ohh i’ve got a couple of mutuals who read no home! i’m reading orv and unlucky mansion right now, both of which will probably take me a minute to get fully caught up with, but you’ve sold no home to me and i’ll happily add it to my list. thank you for such a thoughtful, enthusiastic recommendation 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i have, but so so long ago now :( been meaning to rewatch the anime at least but it doesn’t seem to be available for easily accessible streaming to me 😭 <br><br>not critical thoughts at all but i swear to god when i read/watched it as a kid, they ended up together in my head? and it’s only when i got older and people picked it up for the first time around me that i even found out they didn’t. i felt like the hints were so clear to me before, or maybe part of it was the whole figuring the world out as a queer kid in an all girls school and i just projected most of it onto hachi. but anyway. i have very vague memories all around, minus the fashion. but i feel like that goes for everyone. nana’s a pop culture landmark for a reason. <br><br>narratively and thematically speaking, i don’t have much to offer right now, i’m so sorry. but i promise if i get around to rewatching or maybe even rereading you’ll definitely see me discussing it at length somewhere. thank you for reaching out and being interested in my thoughts at all.</div>

 <div class=reply>ooh man i’ve got like four or five mostly finished ones from this last month or so that i haven’t revisited in a hot minute, and i Might post a couple this weekend depending on how many survive the culling process… but they’ll be for manhwa and not fandoms i’ve written for before, unfortunately. i can’t imagine they’ll be of interest to anyone and i Am thinking of making a new pseud just for manhwa fics, but the point is — i’ve gotten this question a fair amount of times since the idol au finished, so i don’t want to get hopes up for any exciting anime tag fics. but thank you for being curious enough to ask.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha&lt;3 i hope it’s okay to talk to you about this. i don’t really know who else to talk to it with. no need to reply if it’s overbearing. <br>but i’m wondering if you’ve ever felt that it was time to stop writing… i don’t know. i feel like i’m so behind— i wasn’t much of a reader and my vocabulary is limited. i’m not as articulate and precise with words as i’d like to be. i want to improve always, and i know i must be bad first to leave room for growth, but capturing everything i feel and more, it seems beyond me sometimes. what should i do if i want to get better? is it sentence patterns and vocabulary i should be studying? is it just writing like a madman no matter what? is it analyzing every piece of media i ingest so that i can weave its techniques into my own works? i’ve been writing awful poetry for the most of my teen years, and now at 21 i feel like i have so much to make up for that it feels impossible. i don’t mean to whine. i don’t mean to be insufferable, but is it too late for me to realize myself as a writer?<br>i know you’ve expressed that you don’t see yourself as intelligent, but i think your view is obscured as many artists’ are. i see it in your dissection of media. i see it in continuing motifs of your short stories. in sentence patterns. in choosing the right words to preciously communicate all the aches that could possibly be felt. in original ideas to create a story in the first place. in the patience devoted towards writing for the pure sake of writing.<br>i don’t know… english was the only thing and is the only thing i thrive in. but sometimes words are a mystery to me, and when they become mysteries to me in trying to capture whatever it is im feeling, i, in turn become a sort of enigma that slowly pinwheels into a stranger. i don’t like this feeling. <br>i’ve been wanting to live in extensive solitude so that all i’d do is read and write. i hear a writer must endure solitude to see a sharpness to their words. but im coming to believe that one cannot be a writer unless they are a participant in life, unless they are doing the active role of living. i havent done much of that, for better or for worse, a complete fault of my own, im aware. <br>i don’t know, i think im getting too ahead of myself. i don’t really know what it is im saying.<br>sha, what should i do when i can’t imagine another world to live in? when i can’t carve a body shaped hollow in words to make up for my insubstantial presence in this world?<br>im sorry for polluting your cc like this. i just wanted to talk writer to writer with someone. there is absolutely no need to reply, as i know you’ve got your own hands to worry about. i hope your days are gentle, i hope you’re doing alright. thank you for your words, all the ones you’ve given and continue to give x</div>

 <div class=reply>i’ve read this cc how many times now and it never stops being heartbreaking. god. thank you so much for trusting me with it. <br><br>what i’d really like rn is to shake you by the shoulders and tell you it will be fine bc if you can trust our years’ worth of age difference to ensure one thing, it’s that on that front, i know what i’m speaking from. and maybe tap your cheek gently, lovingly, as i would a friend who’s in love with a toxic ex. as in — i love you, i completely understand where all your thoughts are coming from and i sympathize, but you’re spiralling and consumed and can you breathe with me until our heads are clear?<br><br>after all, do you hear yourself? how can you write me such a wonderfully written cc and admit to writing and then speak of realizing yourself as a writer like it hasn’t happened? how can you make me feel so much for what you’re feeling and then talk as if i’ve unlocked some high level magic in my stories? i think it’s fair enough for you to say that my view of my own self is obscured, but if what’s true for me is true for all artists, then that’s true for you, too. i’ll bet my life savings that if you show me your old and current work, i can write you a 4k comment on what has improved. i believe that when living and writing are bound for you, you tend to measure the quality of your writing by how much it encompasses your living, by how symbiotic that rs is, but idk if that’s a reliable metric. you neither have to be fully alone or to live more to write better. you just have to be you, and find a way to funnel that in your writing. it’s hard to love your words when you can’t love the hands that produce them. i know that. but if you must write about feeling insufficient, like you have here, writing won’t say no. it will understand, won’t it? <br><br>you don’t have to justify writing to writing. you just have to do it with what you have. i know the pressure of wanting to improve, i do, esp when you have others to compare your work to, and there’s no harm in figuring out how to generate that improvement. but awful poetry or not, you’ve been writing for So long. don’t quit now. step back if you have to until you feel more substantial, but trust me when i say there’s no such thing as insubstantial presence. nor insubstantial attempts at writing. you’re doing fine. i can say that honestly. i know fine doesn’t feel perfect, but embrace the enigma if you can. isn’t it exciting, to be ever unfolding in life, and therefore in writing? i think it is. <br><br>i’ve already cut up this reply so much to meet the chara limit but — this cc feels deeply kind and lovely to me. enough to break my heart. don’t sell yourself short to me. thank you for receiving my words and giving me yours. treat yourself gently.</div>

 <div class=reply>ofc i have to answer this oh my god :( i mean i have nothing quite as intricate when i’m just a human flashlight beaming thank you in morse code, but i really do think there’s nothing more — fulfilling? rewarding? — than hearing there was an interaction writer to writer. if that makes sense. trying to choose a word that doesn’t call to mind a sixty-year-old accepting a lifetime achievement award. though it does feel like the achievement of a lifetime to know that love for writing is something i can share through… just writing. i’m just really, really, Really glad. that you have such a lovely relationship with writing, and that i could be part of it in some way. i’m also trying my hardest not to be too sentimental with this reply but words are failing me. thank you for liking my words. thank you for leaving this message. thank you for being a writer, as odd as that sounds. <br><br>i wish you nothing but warmth and kindness in all the days ahead 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>not a silly question at all — but yes, easily !! though it might just be bc i have a greater emotional attachment to the story as portrayed on the show than i do the book 🤔 <br><br>that said, i credit the actors a lot for that attachment. book marianne &amp; connell had enough for me to visualize them as suggestions of real people, and it wasn’t necessarily terrible, but i just didn’t connect with them as much as i could have. np was a very cold read for me, at least compared to cwf and bwway. yet the show felt very… full. it felt like it was containing something that could overflow any second, but it never felt overbearing. it was quiet and the depth of the character’s lives, even the parts of it we’ll never get to see, was so gently portrayed. i’d say a lot of that is owed to daisy and paul, who played their characters with so much… silence? what’s a good word for it. subtlety, i guess. there was a quiet softness to how they embodied their characters. a quiet steadiness. i think a huge chunk of what made the book difficult for me to be immersed into is that so much of marianne &amp; connell’s connection is physical and unspoken; they see eye to eye, literally and metaphorically, except in the areas of life where they don’t. that kind of sense of “we don’t talk about it but it’s palpable” isn’t really smth you can convey in prose, or at least not as entirely as you can when you’ve got two great actors with even greater chemistry onscreen building a story with only touch, glances and expressions. daisy’s marianne felt so much more introspective as a result, more multi-faceted in that introspection, while paul’s connell has this constant feeling of watching a glass inch closer and closer towards full until you have to watch the water spill over in the therapy scene. i just thought they did such a great job living their character’s lives, you know? like. we only get to know marianne and connell for a short period of time, but with the way daisy and paul played them, we can feel the outlines of the lives that produced these very real people, and the lives they might have someday whether or not they reunite.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my goodness hi i also hope you’re doing well :( this made my chest feel so, so incredibly tight, and i don’t think there’s thanking you enough for how you took the time to think of my work and leave me such a thoughtful message even amidst what you were feeling. the last month hasn’t been the easiest time for me, i admit, personally and professionally, but i really didn’t mean to be away from this account for as long as i have. please know it means the world to hear something as special as “you’re missed and appreciated.” that ruined me for a good minute there. thank you, and i give back every single warm thing you said to me here. wishing you and your kind heart all the fullness and ease it deserves 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha, it's been a while since i've written in here as an anon but i hope you've been doing well recently! i noticed that you changed your carrd a while back, and some things that were in there previously are no longer there - like the comments/final note on flls &amp; other writing. i adore reading your introspections, and return to read them sometimes. i do hope that they are still online, out there somewhere. if so, could you link it for me? thank you so much! &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no this is from a month ago and you must have either finished or ended up dropping less by now but please know i’m very moved to hear you started reading it bc of me and was enjoying it when you sent me this !! <br><br>and oooh first name to come to mind is james baldwin. just — a perfectly fried egg. crispy in the right places, soft in the others. sentimental without being overromantic. romantic without being idealistic. realistic but never at the expense of how delicately he handles characterization in his prose. nabokov is an easy answer too but that’s mostly a case where his prose is every linguist’s / language enthusiast’s dream. i think it’s bc of him that i’m still partial to books by multilingual authors. they just have a different relationship with the capabilities of english more often than not. who else… the language of virginia woolf’s prose doesn’t do much for me, but her flow is paced perfectly. steinbeck’s prose also goes straight for the heart, but it’s been a decade since i last read him and can’t really tell you how he does it. i should reread east of eden. <br><br>more contemporary writers whose writing i like would probably include… brandon taylor. ali smith. julie otsuka. jeanette winterson consistently puts out terrible and even problematic stories but her prose is excellent. donna tartt’s style is also unparalleled but the beauty of her prose is actually more so clinical/technical than sentimental/emotional by nature. she’s an example of language — word and sentence order, etc — putting in more work than Style style. <br><br>i’m definitely missing a lot lot Lot more names but that’s on me for not reading more. i apologize for not including more but ty for this question 😞</div>

 <div class=reply>GREAT QUESTION. NICE AND DIRECT. also thank you again for that last ranking question omg i was rearranging my shelves the other day and had another rodin’s the thinker moment about it<br><br>hmm criticisms at large would be nonchalant blinks of racism and caricaturish misogyny, but it’s always hard to tell if it’s reflecting theo or donna tartt herself, so this is more an observation than a writerly criticism. i guess my main issue with it is that the last section is beautiful and profound in many personal ways and i think about it a lot, but it also feels disjointed to what came before in the plot. there’s a sense of just wanting to end the story with a monologue after all the narrative beats have been hit plot wise. it’s like the conclusion paragraph to a dissertation that before that point had only winked at the thesis despite providing evidence for some discreet conclusion. so there’s a disconnect there for sure, at least for me. it doesn’t make me enjoy that final section any less, but it’s also one of those things i’d rather not think too hard about. <br><br>i also think the core thematic idea of the story is about grief and the things that save us — people, art, the possibility that life is more exciting than we give it credit for and us therefore more alive — and it’s there, it’s written about, and the final lines just tie it all together, but the chance to stretch that theme out much more evenly across the whole book was definitely sacrificed to include some plot points that wouldn’t have really mattered to the narrative? a lot of the relationships do the heavy lifting, especially in showing how we latch onto reminders of an old life bc that would save us from having to live a new one: theo with his mother, theo with pippa being the only other victim of the attack in his vicinity, mrs barbour with theo, how theo and kitsey agreed to be engaged even as she keeps seeing tom. i wish we trusted them more to do what they’re supposed to, especially pippa and kitsey. donna tartt has a problem with making characters mere representations of an idea, a concept, and that worked very well with the secret history, where the whole point is that the narrator only ever saw these human beings as concepts, but in a book with characters as alive as boris and as deeply introspective as theo, it’s a bit too hard to ignore when certain characters don’t get the same treatment.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha&lt;3 this is the same anon that asked about authors to learn from for growing writers (and the same anon that sent the cc about flls helping me stand against avoidant personality disorder! i hope it’s okay for me to visit here often haha)&lt;3 but i definitely see your point about not necessarily needing to read up on the technicalities of writing to become a writer, and i actually agree with you! i think learning through practice rather than instruction allows more space for growth and creativity and reduces the severity of the “first draft, final draft” mindset. i apologize for not being specific before, but i was hoping to get some novel recs— not necessarily about writing itself— that you think would be good to learn from :D novels that you appreciated and took technical lessons from (be it in the aspect of world building, setting, characterizations, pacing, or any other aspect of writing… i see the goldfinch is up there on your list—rightfully so! and was actually planning to reread sometime! i think i could learn a lot from tartt.) i know there’s many things to be learned from many books, but i guess i’d like to know some of your favorites because i’m a bit overwhelmed and am not sure where to start. when i said i haven’t read much while practicing writing, i meant that i haven’t read much of /anything/ while writing, and it’s embarrassing to admit but i’m trying my best to make up for it :] thank you so much for your previous recommendations though— i will definitely traverse through those works as well!!! also thank you, truly, for being so encouraging and kind to the learning writers here. your support and advice mean a lot!&lt;3 hope the days are gentle! <br>-a</div>

 <div class=reply>OH IM MORTIFIED SORRY FOR GOING OFF A TANGENT WITH YOU INSTEAD OF ASKING WHAT KIND OF RECS YOU EVEN MEANT AHH NO THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION LET ME SEARCH MY BRAIN<br><br>technical lessons from novels… i def agree with you on things we could learn from donna tartt, but when it comes to learning, i’d say the secret history is a great example of an unreliable narrator. richard is inconsistent, easily seduced and is also handed an especially romantic kind of prose. there’s that line from lolita by vladmir nabokov where the narrator says you can always count on a m*rderer for a fancy prose style, which is applicable to tsh as well. i also recommend lolita for having an unreliable narrator (i think people forget that it’s essentially a true crime novel, humbert humbert an alias, the book comes with a fictional foreword talking about how he quite literally has to be studied for his crimes, blah blah blah) but that doesn’t change the crimes depicted in the story, so i understand why people steer clear. i haven’t read it since hs myself, but its prose truly does hit like nothing else. <br><br>(here’s an article by hanya yanagihara, whose work i loathe, and i don’t 100% agree here, but it’s true that nabokov is a master at making language do what language does: https://lithub.com/the-pure-pleasure-of-reading-lolitas-first-100-pages)<br><br>other examples i love: less by andrew sean greer has an initially unrevealed narrator who isn’t the protagonist. it was such a thrilling way of handling both characterization and narration. james salter does a similar thing in a sport and a pastime, but that book… no comment. sea of tranquility by emily st. john mandel also did so well seamlessly tying together worldbuilding across timelines separated by centuries. <br><br>and bc you mention practicing writing (which i don’t think you should be embarrassed about! we all reach a point where we want to read more to be able to do more) i was talking to a friend the other day about how neither of us like margaret atwood’s novels but her short format works do some wonderful stylistic things. the story happy endings comes to mind. i think there’s a lot to be learned about your own style if you pick one of her stories and consider how you would do a variation of that format.<br><br>as for pacing, characterization and dialogue, i actually find that novels aren’t always the best place to turn to for that? some authors do well with their characters (sally rooney has her moments, and salinger is kind of The Guy for writing fleshed out young people with distinct ways of talking and behaving), but films for me have been more helpful in pacing. sometimes i like to read screenplays alongside watching the movie it’s for, so i can get a sense of beats of conversation and body language and such. greta gerwig, richard linklater &amp; diablo cody come to mind. <br><br>anyway this is getting long i’m rambling but i’m sorry again for misunderstanding and visit any time, a ✨🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i’ve heard about it! i was in a pretty rocky mental health situation when the licensed release first became available so i steered clear but to be honest, i don’t know if i’m doing that much better these days to give it a shot? the art i’ve seen is gorgeous, though… i’m just wary from the premise bc mariko’s story seems to be positioned in a way that i’m not necessarily keen to see su*cide portrayed as, you know? at least not at the moment. it’s one of those kinds of stories that are hard for me to gauge if i’d like it bc a lot of the reviews are “this is sad” or “this made me cry” and that doesn’t really answer much for me. whose story is centred? shiino’s or mariko’s? if so, why have shiino as a central character? does it romanticize su*cide through the element of friendship in the story? what’s its stance on whether one can be “saved” from su*cide? does it earn its pathos and characterization? that sort of thing. <br><br>but this isn’t me saying no, i don’t wanna read it ever! it’s def still in my radar. i’m sorry i don’t have a clearer answer to give, but i appreciate you coming by to recommend it.</div>

 <div class=reply>i always seem to pick the worst time to step away from this inbox, and i really am sorry that i left your message sitting unanswered for as long as i have. <br><br>when people ask this, what they tend to mean is, does it ever get any easier? and if you ask me if it ever stops taking work to live, or if life stops requiring you to actually live it, then the truth is no, i’ve found that it won’t really get any easier in that sense. there will always be more things you have to live for and live with. but does it ever get better? yes, i absolutely think so. i think it gets better bc the more you allow yourself to grow up and become someone totally new, the more that you get the hang of how nothing in life is really set in stone. <br><br>when you see your life and everything in the past as being some kind of stagnant void of nothing, it makes sense that you’ll look ahead and expect the same from your future. i get that. how can we be adults and still feel the way we did as children? how can we have more choices / power / experience now and still feel lost and helpless? bc we have an idea of who we were when we were younger, we think wow we’re so much older now and nothing has changed? but as much as your current self is the oldest you’ve ever been, it’s also one of the youngest ages you’ll ever be to your future self. if i have a motto in life at the moment, it’s really that if i can’t do it for my current self, or if i don’t want anything to do with my past child self, at the very least i can try for my future self. i don’t want them to have the same regrets that i currently do. that sort of thing. <br><br>again. if you ask me if it ever gets better, my answer would be yes, it does. there’s so much pressure to work towards this idea of better when what we really mean is better than right now, but it’s also. just live your life. allow yourself to pursue small things that accumulate to a bigger better. i know that’s idealistic and easier to say for me, now that i’m medicated and working and a year older than who i was when my depression was at its absolute worst, but idk. i really think life comes down to doing the best we can in the moment, even if you have to fake it till you make it. or be idealistic. sometimes all the best i have isn’t even for myself, but it keeps me going. so. i assume living towards something better is much the same. <br><br>this probably isn’t much help, and i really am sorry for taking a while to reply. i am sending you so much warmth and well wishes. thank you for trusting me with this question, and i wish you the absolute best.</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh i mean. well. it’s alright? i’m certainly not rabid about it, but it’s one of the earlier post-secret history examples of ~dark academia to gain proper attention so i was down to give it a shot. i liked maybe one scene from it. the ending did stay with me for about a week. the prose was definitely not terrible, and i’m a sucker for this kind of portrayal of thespian life, especially when shakespeare is involved and treated with gravity. but iwwv just wasn’t… giving. for me, at least. i can see why people would like it. but it’s not a book i myself can love nor hate. it’s more like. if this was school and it’s a classmate i see coming down the hallway towards me, i’ll maybe offer a smile if we make eye contact. but no proper greeting, and no stopping to chat. <br><br>i guess there was just this sense of “well, that was… a book.” it was like the author prioritized hitting recognizable atmospheric beats and ideas that they didn’t bother too much with necessarily earning or fleshing them out. the parts were there, its outlines were suggested well enough that you’re like oh i see, yet a lot of it was hollow and empty. the characters had no life to them. james and oliver were the most you can get invested in and even that, like the rest of the dynamics in the book, were just the author going dude just trust me. and you have no choice but to just accept it bc it’s not like there’s anything to fight against. nothing stood out, good or bad. it couldn’t even integrate shakespeare quotes naturally. it’s like someone said “dark academia tropes but theatre bc hey i know theatre” and submitted their first draft of their first interpretation. i finished it and closed it and thought to myself, “on second thought, the secret history was actually pretty great. wow. it sure is irreplicable outside of donna tartt’s hands.” and i’m aware we shouldn’t compare all dark academia books to tsh bc that’s against the whole point of genres and stories inspired by their predecessors, but the book itself isn’t faultless in generating that comparison. i would even argue iwwv’s concept and premise would have just better benefited if it had nothing to inform it. instead what we got was a lacklustre world, a lacklustre cast, a lacklustre “mystery” and a lacklustre “twist” ending. it was a big shrug. my expression probably didn’t change once. yet i still finished it. so that’s something. <br><br>i’m sorry if this is a book that means a lot to you :( i really do understand why people would read it and rate it so highly. i do wanna clarify that any dislike or aversion doesn’t equate to hatred either. it’s hardly a little life to me. iwwv was the definition of a fifty percent grade. a five out of ten. a 2.5 out of 5. i think i gave it three stars in my lc, even. it fed me enough to pass.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha, this is kind of a nebulous question, but i was wondering if do you feel like you have a specific way you go about writing? not as in a routine but more in the structure of a paragraph or sentence &amp; how you transcribe actions, feelings, scenery, and dialogue, like how you develop a narrative or introduce the reader to a story. sorry for how scattered this is; it's something that has been floating around in my brain for a while now and ive been kind of struggling to verbalize it in a way that makes sense.</div>

 <div class=reply>i start with dialogue nearly always! most stories i’ve written started with one to three spoken lines. when i open a doc or start a new scene, i usually just get the dialogue out of the way, if there’s any. as in i literally just type it all out as it is in my head. if i need a beat between two batches of dialogue i put a slash mark between them. if i need a lot of breathing room before the rest of the conversation i’ll put an ellipsis to indicate that this imagery needs fleshing out. if i can’t put too much info into dialogue bc the speaker isn’t the type to confess these types of emotions or if it would be too unnatural to include all this exposition in the dialogue, i’ll add a little asterisk so i know. that sort of thing. <br><br>i know people have tended to point out my preference for introspection — and it’s not wrong, i do love writing introspection — but psychologically interpreting characters is the easier, more organic part. converting that understanding to dialogue that i can greenlight, and building the world / au that makes that specific piece of dialogue possible — that’s the thrilling problem solving part !! everything else is secondary to the lines i write first. introspection, the setting, the feelings i choose to describe in more depth, the body language i include. dialogue is the core element that i aim to earn in a story. this includes characterization, through what they say and how they said it but also what they Don’t say, what i choose to only allude to in body movements, in glances, in introspection. often i choose the setting of a story based on what will allow me the rhythm i need for the dialogue that needs to happen in a scene, and if i feel like two scenes of dialogue happen too quickly after each other, then you get paragraphs of fleshing out the pov narrator, of making them make sense enough that hopefully a reader will understand their interiority beyond dialogue. kinda like putting into words what choices i would make if i was acting out this scene off a sparse script. <br><br>if a reader can’t understand why someone would say this or that, or if the pacing is so off that i can’t immerse someone in the flow of the conversation or the lead-up to an important line, then that’s a failed mission on my part. in an ideal world, i’d like all my characters to feel real, enough that anyone reading can empathize and understand them even if you don’t necessarily relate, and for me, dialogue is the most essential building block to get to that. it’s where narrative begins and develops from for me. when a reader is introduced to a character, everything plays a part — the setting, their expression, who they’re talking to, if we start with introspection or with dialogue — but all of that is only possible bc i likely started a doc with one line that informed the rest. <br><br>god is this pretentious ?? probably. tysm for this question and i’m so sorry for rambling. i just got giddy for a sec 😭</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! i was wondering if you had any tips on how to write original works along with fan fiction? i love writing fanfic, but i definitely strive to be a writer. however, i can’t, for the life of me, seem to balance writing both. i /want to/, but if i start writing originals i always end up going back to fics and it bothers me a lot :( i was also wondering if you had any tips on how to handle mental health when it comes to writing. i struggle with depression a lot and it affects my writing, too, which i’m mostly okay with—i don’t mind writing as an escape, or a way of dealing with my emotions, but sometimes my own mental health makes me feel terrible about everything i write and it’s so frustrating!!! thank you and sorry if this question is A Lot 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>lots of difficult questions here — but please don’t be sorry omg i completely understand struggling with all these things. though i’d be lying if i said i’ve figured out answers to any of them.<br><br>my theory is that when we write fic, chances are we’ve already handed over our love to the source material; all that’s left is to think about it and write about that. with original projects, that isn’t a given. you have to learn how to love your original world before there’s even anything substantial to love. so ofc it will be a struggle. don’t beat yourself up for it. nothing substantial also means no existing rules in place unless you say so. so be the first person to fall in love with the world inside your head. be obsessive. be ambitious, even if it’s ultimately impossible. make disorganized pinterest boards for your characters. playlists. consume media that might have similar vibes. collect quotes or details from your life that might be relevant. make the world realer, get your mind and your heart churning about its possibilities. learn to love your own work the way you’d love someone else’s. simulate the same rs you have with the media you write fics for. <br><br>and hmm honestly i’m still at the stage where i hate my writing. it’s not as bad as i used to hate it, but i still fight with it, resent it, demand why it can’t just do what i want. but i also can’t live without writing. even when i hate it or it hates me, i can’t stay away from it. and what i tell myself is — what does it matter if i feel terrible about my writing rn? there’s nothing i can do about that. will this story magically finish itself if i just learn to love every word i put down? no. writing will still be writing and writing is what i need to do. the loving it can come after. <br><br>idk. it’s a lot to ask from your writing to always be loveable. to not make you frustrated. to be painless. so i don’t ask for that. we want to be writers, right? so we write. the words and the world are there. like i said above, you just have to love what your story could be. you don’t have to love the whole process, or love your prose like hell, to write. maybe that’s unhealthy of me, and i know it’s easier said than done with depression, but writing has saved me from my own thoughts and emotions. so those don’t get a say in whether i write. they can comment On my writing, but they don’t get to stop me from the physical act of writing. and all that writing asks of us is to write. nothing else. no quality control, no prerequisites. trust yourself not to think too much. let writing be an agent, an act, and not a tool, you know? <br><br>i know none of this is solid advice, but it’s the only way i’ve known to make it worth it. i’m sorry for not being more helpful, but i truly do wish you all the best in your writing.</div>

 <div class=reply>KIND AND DEVOTIONAL. WHAT A LOVELY THING TO SAY. THANK YOU. I HOPE THE DAYS ARE NOTHING BUT KIND AND DEVOTIONAL TO YOU AS WELL. <br><br>this is really interesting bc imo it’s not automatically a mistake to just write and write without reading up on the academics of it? i’d argue you can only grow in writing by doing it, and no amount of reading up on the act and craft of it will do the work of improving your writing the same way just writing would. reading, full stop, is one thing; ofc you have to read novels and open yourself up to other stories to push along the trajectory of your own writing. but writing About writing? i’m not sure it’s a necessary first step. it’s a step, definitely, and ultimately it depends on what kind of learner you are, but at the end of the day i’m biased bc i’m not the biggest fan of learning writing like this. i’m more of a jump first, think later learner and writer, in the sense that i’d prefer to have mistakes to correct rather than learn about what mistakes Not to do before even writing. that kind of approach tend to find people getting too caught up on potential mistakes that they don’t end up doing any writing at all. but anyway. this long preface is just to caution you against that. i think reading up on the advice of other authors is very, Very valuable, as is learning from any other kind of artist (i’m partial to learning how film directors and screenwriters work myself), but you have to remember when seeking them out that every single storyteller is different and what works for one who happens to be successful enough to write a book on it doesn’t make that advice universal. like any advice, you have to try it and see if it fits, then discard it if it stunts you more than it helps you. <br><br>that said, i think ursula k. le guin has the best writing advice in the game, bc she understands that the act of writing isn’t a precise art. the Craft of writing is, but writing itself is about intuition, and you’ll do better to cultivate that intuition rather than memorize and adhere exclusively to a specific set of rules. nearly all of ursula k. le guin’s nonfiction delves into stories and writing, and i recommend them all, but in this specific context, i’d suggest either edition of steering the craft, the chapbook talking about writing, and/or her interview collection with david naimon. bird by bird by anne limmott is also a rather graceful read. and craft in the real world by matthew salesses is a great intro to deconstructing the traditional, often flimsily relevant tips that writing classes and workshops tend to give students who might come from different cultural storytelling backgrounds altogether. <br><br>truthfully idk how helpful any of these are, but please know i’m cheering you on with all my heart in all your writing endeavours. be open to finding what works for you and know yourself best in your writing 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no not rude at all ty for being interested !! lycoris recoil has been such a breath of fresh air? it has the vibes and humour of early kyoani titles like k on and haruhi suzumiya and lucky star, which i’m always a sucker for even at my age, but with a distinctly action based flare. so i’m really, really enjoying it. and i’m incredibly fond of chisato as well. takina and kurumi are great, too, as are even the girls in the da. i love that each of them work so differently, and are quite steadfast in those values even when it clashes with someone else’s. it’s very easy to spin the dynamics in the show as like, oh, you have so much to learn from each other, so learn to change and adapt, etc. and it’s still true, but takina has as much to learn from herself as she does chisato and everyone else. she just has to figure it out by being placed in a different environment, and a place like lycoreco, where the missions and obligations are totally foreign to her, is the perfect catalyst for that. the story doesn’t ask her to change her organized way of looking at the world and the work ethics she relies on to carry those out; it just asks her to widen the world a little, to apply those ethics and values and perspectives to things beyond what she has so far. it certainly doesn’t ask her to be more like chisato, nor vice versa, and so it means all the more that their dynamic becomes what it is by simply meeting each other halfway as individual people. and ahhh chisato is just so great. so stubborn, so allowed by the world to be unhinged, so set on values that no one has ever tried to take down bc in many ways she’s always been invincible. she’s been validated in her values bc she’s been validated in who she is. she gets to be cheerful and carefree and have an i do what i want attitude bc she’s earned it with her competence and her experience as a first lycoris. even when she’s met with disapproval, she’s armed with enough as she currently is to stand her ground. bc what can anyone do against her, really? it’s a very interesting take on your usual gifted child gone wrong narrative, as is takina. but chisato’s a bit of a prodigal son? she’s accountable for her actions without having to be responsible for them necessarily, so it’s cool that the latest episodes seem to be headed towards that. chisato lacks a proper compass in life, not like takina and her more concrete values, and it’s not a bad thing, but now that she’s met the alan institute member who gave her a new heart and it didn’t go as she planned for possibly one of the first few times in her life, i’m super intrigued where we’ll go. what has she been living for this whole time, you know? <br><br>then there’s the whole raising a child army out of orphans thing. and terrorism. and also delving into what we owe the people that quite literally save our lives. what is your life worth, and is it enough to have a debt to the person who made sure it continues?</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh i… am so sorry, but i don’t… think it is? ahhh i really am sorry. usually when i get ccs about whether i’ll write about so and so i answer that it’s never say never bc i myself don’t know what i’ll write about until i do, so i’m not going to completely discount the possibility of me writing stsg ever, but the chances do… look quite slim. they’re personally not a pairing that speaks to me in the fic-writing capacity? by which i mean that their established dynamic in canon doesn’t offer enough room for me to write a full-fledged fic that would interest me enough to write. at most, i’ll have like. a 3k fic. i can’t recall what i said in a stsg cc from what must be a year ago now but i think their story is already complete. it’s compact and there’s a lot of heartache there but — it is what it is. there are things they’ll never be able to do again. it will be a beginning, every time, bc something has already ended. that’s the tragedy and weight of being stsg. what’s done is done and what was will always be. it wouldn’t be entirely faithful to all that their individual characters are if i just throw them outside of the scope of that kind of narrative, and despite any evidence to the contrary and all the aus i write, i’m really not great with steering too far from canon events and characterization. so i’m 98% sure i have nothing to add or explore that canon doesn’t already bear the brunt of and that stsg fics tend to only reiterate in different ways, and whatever speculation you can have with who they could have been in another life, i think i already channelled as best as i can in how i wrote them in flls. <br><br>i did used to have stsg wips within the flls universe (i tweeted about one ages ago, and the snippet isn’t really stsg-centric but i just want to cross my heart and prove that the wip existed once https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1381152126936748039?s=20&amp;t=c8KOM8CWN5P3ci4e_-stqw 😭) but they’re long abandoned now. stsg is great to me in outlines, in little shadowed suggestions of who they’ve become to each other and what that means for the generation they managed to help raise. so i think i’m comfortable leaving my take on them at that. if that makes sense. <br><br>the bottomline is i think stsg writers work very hard and make really great work in populating that tag and keeping this dynamic alive, and i don’t think i quite have the openness or the audacity to intrude upon that space, you know? i’m so sorry i don’t have a better answer, but i really, really appreciate that you’d be interested at all in seeing more of my perspective on them. i hope the rest of your month is as kind to you as can be.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh thank you so much! that's very kind of you, though i wouldn’t say i’m particularly well-read… or at least i don’t do it enough to be indiscriminate with what i read? but i double majored in classics (not the english lit classics but all that greek and roman stuff, though my focus was really just on philology while my thesis/research was on numismatics, etc.) + linguistics (not the grammar and language learning kind but the psycholinguistics / sociolinguistics / phonetics / syntax / semantics / stuffing kind elderly people with broca’s aphasia in an mri machine. so a lot less academic than some people assume. it was my fallback in case i wanted to try speech pathology after school. then i took the lsat and threw out that plan for a bit.) <br><br>idk why i went into so much detail there but i feel like i’ll be masquerading as an academic that i’m definitely not if i don’t clarify that i just basically double majored in the programs with the smallest classes come second year and the last thing i want is to act like i was doing more glorified stuff than i really was 😞</div>

 <div class=question>haha no honestly the times it happened i could feel my dorm mates be like um do u practice witchcraft?? because the first time it happened i think i only told a friend or two but the second time i basically announced it like yo i dreamt that theyd only suspend people who've been suspended before (this isnt something the school had ever done so disproves the pattern recognition??) and when the headmistress called us out of the dorm area and was like "if youve been suspended before start packing your bags" i started laughing and crying LOL. i couldve propably made big bank by pretending to be a mystic.<br>honestly looking back tho both suspensions were very deserved, i often look back at myself in that time like what was going through my head why was i doing these things smh. blaming it on teenage self centeredness!!<br>but also omg i do find it cool that no one couldve predicted that sort of friendship forming between you both! there's probably something deep to be said there but it just made me think :wow birds of a feather really don't flock together. i think this shows the extent of my brain rot<br>anyways i hope you're well or something of the sort :)) and nice to hear from you too</div>

 <div class=reply>omg those are like… biblical level small miracles. that’s so cool, but also so ??? i wonder what happened there ?? once is coincidence, but twice and more 👀ALSO AHHH PLEASE i feel you completely on the teenage era chaos and wondering what the hell was going on in their mind. i mean i know what was going through my mind then but that doesn’t mean i approve of what i did by extension to those thoughts. i used to fight So many people. literal strangers on the bus, people opposite me on class debates, people just literally opposite me in class seats, who i don’t even talk to. my temper, god. textbook repressed child kept in a cage given ample people to justifiably throw my anger at or whatever. <br><br>and yeah right !! a lot of my friendships began so unpredictably, but there’s smth comforting about that, i guess. not in the opposites attract way but more in the sometimes it’s the people you don’t expect to stay in your life that barge in and change it a little. <br><br>anyway above all i hope you’re also well and enjoying the last few weeks of summer &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>omg have i never talked about mp100?? the love of my life? my infinite serotonin pump? my go-to mainstream anime rec? the ancestral home of my family? the representation of all i could ever want in any story? the second season of which is quite literally the only anime that i’ll give a perfect five stars to?<br><br>i love mp100, is what i’m saying. the manga is fun and hilarious and so, so heartfelt and i love it dearly but the anime is just 👌🏼 i think one-sensei has such interesting ideas about the dominant tropes in shounen media and his particular brilliance is how he chooses to subvert these existing tropes while still presenting a story that fulfills the demands of its genre. but while one punch man’s story and world is bigger and more substantial, mp100 is its quieter, younger, more personal sibling. it’s self-aware in a way that feels almost like a special, intimate sort of vulnerability. it takes the chuunibyou tropes in other anime and not only satirizes them but also spins a proper coming of age story done exactly how it should be. i have so many praises to sing about it. <br><br>i just think — mp100 has so much heart, and so much understanding for the human condition. you can say that about any series, but the choices mp100 makes for its character leave me awed again and again. the story’s gags and solutions are ridiculous at points, and it presents arguments that i’m sure plenty of other stories have parroted at us before — but the thing is that they haven’t done it like mp100 has. i don’t think anyone ever will. mp100 is just absurd enough to skirt being too melodramatic, and too personal to ever be superficial. it’s a perfectly balanced, perfectly seasoned story, and its characters, in all their ridiculousness, are so vivid and loveable. i could rewatch it forever. i def think season two already covered the strongest arcs from the manga, but to say i’m excited for the new season would also be an understatement.</div>

 <div class=question>hello! i don’t mean to sound overbearing but i just read flls and.. i’m genuinely not joking when i say your words have changed me. maybe it seems silly or even oversentimental but i haven’t really realized i deserved self love until i read your work. i struggle greatly with avoidant personality disorder and saw bits of myself in your megumi, and bits of myself in your yuuji as well in the aspect of feeling guilty for wanting to be loved and receiving it unconditionally. anyways i don’t mean to ramble, but when i saw how utterly real and valid megumi and yuuji’s emotions were, and how they loved each other despite of it all, it made me realize that i, too, am only human and am bound to mistakes and uncertainty, but that i deserve to take up space and have a self all the while. i just wanted to say thank you for helping me get to this point. i hope this doesn’t make the imposter syndrome anymore potent (i also like to write in my free time and my friends think i’m Smart, but i find myself pretty stupid as well😭) but from writer to writer, no pedestal in sight, thank you. i have ached alongside your words not only for those boys but also for my growing self. i hope i didn’t cross any boundaries by sending this— feel free to ignore if so. thank you for sharing your words with us :)</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my goodness are u kidding me this is not overbearing at all !!!! no boundaries crossed whatsoever, but i truly do appreciate you being so mindful and so careful with the intention behind each word you chose. it seriously means a lot, more than i have the words for at 2 AM, or ever, really. thank you, thank you, thank you. <br><br>i always find that responses to flls tend to contain a little bit of the sender’s personal life, and each time it stuns me speechless how… universal some things are? maybe that’s not the best word to use for it, bc universality implies it isn’t special — but it is. to think that at the time of writing flls, all i wanted was to write a yuuji and a megumi that felt real to the me back then, who did justice to the boys i wanted to come alive through this story, and to find out in the months that follow that there are people out there who see themselves in these characters, in this world, that any sort of fictional realness transcends beyond this little love story — i just never know what to say. gratitude never feels enough or right, though of course i’m grateful beyond words. touched is another thing; no matter how detached i feel from flls sometimes, how aware i am that it’s no longer mine, i’ll always be moved by getting to hear one on one testimonies about it. so it’s really just — i guess it reminds me, makes me all the more aware each time, what stories are capable of, and why i want to be a writer. i know that’s cheesy but that really is what it does to hear someone speaking about your story like it’s theirs too in its own way. and it is! stories are passed along from one human life to another! that’s what stories do! that’s why i write! moments like this, the ways that we can be connected even through fiction, stranger to stranger, character to person, writer to writer… i won’t trade it for anything else in the world. <br><br>all this to say, thank you for this cc and for reminding me yet again why writing stories is always worth it. and Hell Yeah you deserve to take up space and have a self !! you have nothing to thank me for; it’s hard work getting to that point, and you got there yourself from just a few words off a fic so i hope you know how amazing that is. i wish you all the growth, all the warmth, all the love, from yourself and those around you. take care of yourself, and again, thank you so much 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i hope your summer is treating you kindly as well !! and oooh yes i’ve definitely considered, and have come close to making one at certain points, but i still… have a lot of hesitation? i’d love to have a place to log the things i watch but letterboxd just doesn’t give me the right vibes for that at the moment. something about the culture and etiquette around it. just makes me uneasy. or puts me off, how people consume media over there. but i’m honestly probably overinflating my qualms about it. i’m just reluctant about social cataloguing apps, is all. i’m still very open to making an account if ever i really need to someday, but i also just doubt that i’m enough of a film watcher and/or eloquent enough of a critic for films to make much good use of a letterboxd account, you know? my literal club is already too quiet and self-indulgent enough as it is. but tysm for thinking to ask :)</div>

 <div class=reply>interesting !! i always joke that i find a line i like maybe once per year, but it’s actually quite literal. it really is once a year on average that i write a line and think “whoa… yeah. that’s it. that’s exactly it.” but it’s worth it bc when it happens, it’s impossible to miss. it’s a very specific feeling? like two pieces just perfectly sliding against each other and once it’s clicked in place, you can’t separate them. that’s what a good line feels like. it’s different from liking a general scene or an idea or a dialogue exchange. when a line is good, it Feels a specific kind of good. and it’s only happened twice in recent memory, but i remember both moments vividly. <br><br>in 2021 it was “i’m sorry i loved you in silence.” from here and where you are. it’s prob still The blueprint for what i consider a good line. with dialogue and introspection at your disposal i think there’s always the temptation to explain and expand, but both are still methods of characterization. you’re limited by the pov you’re writing from. there’s a voice you have to stay faithful to. and with megumi, there was always a restriction in what i can fully express bc the way he articulates and thinks of things is so specific to him. it’s organized, but it’s neat exactly bc so much is out of his control. and yeah, he’s allowed a confession in that fic, gets space to explore the things he didn’t do, but all of it just comes down to this one sentence. everything he could possibly say, gathered into this one short sentence. concise and yet brimming over with so much in a way only a sentence from megumi can. i wrote this line and felt quite proud. <br><br>and i still have some time left in 2022 but so far two potential contenders for my fav line this year are “it feels like i’m just begging you to love me Despite or With or Because of something when i don’t want anyone else to have to love me with a preposition attached” and “happiness for me has just been realizing i’ve grown up—or am on the way to growing up—to be the sort of person my child self would have felt safe with” from the idol au. both felt cathartic and right for separate reasons bc two different characters are saying it, but in this case, i liked these lines bc i knew i couldn’t delete these sentences as soon as i put it down. so much of the idol au was different to me bc i wasn’t writing people having to heal or learn to love and be known… they’re people who have already survived whatever there was to survive, who have lived this whole time already in the aftermath of something. but writing these two lines, i felt grounded in where we were and where i was taking these characters, so they’re both memorable for me. <br><br>but we’ll see! maybe i’ll write another line i like in the coming months!</div>

 <div class=reply>THIS MADE ME SMILE SO BIG I LOVE ANY CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT CONSTELLATION PRIZE !! but ahhh i think the reason i love it so much, aside from the sound mixing and the documentary style, is how every episode is so widely different. i love when a creator’s hand is so lovingly present in the structure of a series, and there’s so much intention but also lighthearted goodwill in the things bianca giaever chose to dedicate five episodes to without any real theme or common variable to tie it altogether the way we traditionally expect. it’s always just nice when consuming someone’s work feels like having a conversation with them, except instead of language it’s just vibes. like yes, here’s a peek into your art and your life and it doesn’t mean i know what kind of person you are but in a way i feel like we have connected personally. that sort of thing. <br><br>my fav would probably be a tie between crossing guard and two years with franz, though! i’m a little too conflicted to pick one over the other bc each has its own particular strength. i’ve relistened to crossing guard the most bc it puts me in the audio mindset when i’m editing or producing, but in retrospect, two years with franz is the most interesting episode premise. its thesis/overarching idea isn’t quite as strongly conveyed as crossing guard’s — i mean, the presentation of urban loneliness in that ep hits more and more each passing year, and it’s so rare that you get a reading of sartre like this – but i loved the concept of forming a relationship with an artist from his audio recordings alone. what a brilliant and perfect subject for a literal podcast. my chest is squeezing just thinking about it.</div>

 <div class=question>what do you think is the weirdest coincidence in your lore. maybe not funny haha but like huh that was a weird coincidence. mine is that two times i dreamt that i'd be suspended and the teacher that would make it worse AND the conditions that it would occur under and both times it happened the same way. its funny how the brain can recognize patterns in the world and create predictions that in another time would be considered prophetic vision ~ nao</div>

 <div class=reply>listen i’ve been thinking about this for like ten days now and i don’t know if i have any? certainly not to this degree bc oh my god i am so sorry about the suspensions and the teacher making it even worse but also the idea of prophetic dreams is making my brain whir. yes, probably it’s the brain recognizing patterns and projecting it onto dream scenarios but the “time is circular and everything is happening all at the same time” implications 🤔 am i joking i don’t even know i’m not a conspiracy theorist i swear and i hope none of my dreams are prophetic bc i get unalived far too regularly in them<br><br>the most recent coincidence ish i can think of is… during one manic episode before my last year of uni i somehow bagged both the newspaper and the shakespeare troupe, where i had to work with a director to rewrite a midsummer night’s dream. but i met with the director before school started and our chemistry was just. disastrous. idk if he’s one of those people who others wrongly think is mean and judgemental when he isn’t but if he had a warm bone in his body it was never directed at me. that man made my life a living hell. no one else has given me as much anguish, not even my father. i was out of there as soon as i could be. didn’t even go to tech week. but the day we first met, i vividly remember mentioning i’d be writing for the newspaper, and he told me that his boyfriend is as well. so i was dreading it by the time i met the rest of my newspaper team bc man who could love someone like that. and for a while i just avoided the boyfriend. we tried to pretend knowing a person in common made us get along. it didn’t work. i was convinced they traded stories about me. it was horrible. yet miraculously the boyfriend ended up becoming one of my best uni friends, and we got to be close enough that i was caught in the middle when those two broke up at the end of that school year. and like. if you told me i’d have strong feelings and need to defend / mediate between two people whose dynamics with me started like That, i might have laughed.<br><br>anyway none of this is a coincidence per se so much as a “wow, how did this all turn out like this?” thing bc the then boyfriend is still one of my absolute fav people in the world now. the friend i adore the most. prob the reason my fav personality types and zodiac signs are my fav at all. nearly all my best memories from the last couple years are with this guy. i love him as much as i hated that ex of his. will support him till the end of time, questionable choices and all. <br><br>okay this isn’t a cool story at all, but it’s just funny to me that our beginning was the opposite of prophetic :) either way it’s really nice to hear from u !!</div>

 <div class=reply>hello !! and no, not all yet !! oh but wait – have i talked about starting it before? i can’t remember if i have. either way, not much has changed in the past couple months; i only started it when it first came out and made it about two? three? eps in? which prob isn’t a lot to really say anything entirely fair about it. but with only these in mind, my thoughts are mostly that… like. normal people was an improvement upon the book for me, personally. i think it expanded my understanding of the original novel and its characters and portrayed marianne &amp; connell’s relationship in a way that the novel didn’t quite convey to me with the same tools available to daisy edgar jones and paul mescal’s acting choices. so much of normal people is about the physical and unspoken components of intimacy and connection, and that shone so much more in the tv format. <br><br>and the cwf show has the same vibes as normal people, which is a plus, and i was excited about the cast when the news first came out, but at the same time it felt like it did the opposite of what the normal people show did with its source. frances is a very introspective narrator to me, and the reason the book might have earned my affection altogether was bc she had this interesting… detachment? to her? or this particular quality, this difficulty communicating and properly self-actualizing, that people around her interpreted as coldness. iirc she says a couple times that she just isn’t very emotional, and multiple characters imply that she just needs to be more vulnerable, but i loved that she wasn’t. she was reflective and constantly in her head, but she also wasn’t quite entirely sentimental or soft-hearted. she’s a thinker guided by her contemplations at best. and as far as i’ve seen, i just don’t think the show captured that. alison oliver is a wonderful actress and very lovely in the role, but it also didn’t feel… like frances? none of them did. they felt like approximations of their characters instead of, say, different interpretations of those characters, like the normal people cast’s choices. the second one would have been more than fine, but the result of the first is just… quite lacklustre. i didn’t feel all that invested, which is prob why i haven’t finished. deviating from the source material can be a great thing, but in this case, not only did it not expand upon the strengths of the book, it just did not capture its heart either. it’s lonely instead of lonesome, for example. desperate to be loved instead of almost… intrigued? by the chance to love. at least from the eps i’ve seen. i don’t think it’s the show’s fault, necessarily. i’d argue cwf just isn’t a book meant for the visual medium, and it’s even less suited for what a multi-episode format demands.</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh man i’m not sure what counts as in the making necessarily… i write plenty of things that i’m sure will never see the light of day, and sometimes i’m wrong about that, sometimes i delete the doc/folder altogether, it really comes down to chance. there are so many unfinished/in the making fics across my various drives that i get stressed just thinking about organizing them one of these days 😅<br><br>but i suppose i Have been writing on and off for various little fics! just to keep myself sane and to warm up (procrastinate) for an original project. i have a blp canonverse fic that was around 75% done before some stuff went down that kinda reframed my relationship with the series, and it’s such a shame bc i was so fond of the premise and now it’s a lot to even think about finishing it. i’ve also had a first chapter done for a while now for a tomodachi game mystery au i tweeted about wanting to write but as always i don’t know how to write a contained au and now every part of it is bigger than i have the time/energy/capacity to see through right now. not that i think anyone would want to read either except for me, honestly. <br><br>so yes technically i do have fics in the making, but in practice it’s mostly [millisecond-long footage of me thrashing around the carpet] tysm for asking though it’s very nice to hear someone might be interested in any other fic i might write !!</div>

 <div class=reply>i was wondering if someone was going to ask about this, so thank you for doing it so nicely and i also hope you’re doing well! <br><br>i’m honestly not 100% on that thread (that i assume we both saw), and i resent the tone that op used in it + the nebulousness of the claims upon fact-checking. which isn’t to say it’s definitely false — if i had more certainty, i’d have a more certain stance too. i also think the non-separation of a work from its author should be a widespread approach but not necessarily in a hard one-note rule kind of way, if only bc the latter tends to set up more issues imo.<br><br>that said, i’ve had some lingering misgivings about blp’s narrative for a few months now, and while i’m not at a point where i’ll stop reading (i still read this month’s chapter, for instance, even if i didn’t pay for it like i usually would), i do know that the story has lost its magic for me. it doesn’t remove any fondness i ever felt for these characters and its storylines, nor discount any of the claims i made in my video essay, nor even stop me from wanting a cloud tattoo or something — but this current arc in the manga... just isn’t the best execution. blp has suffered and strained from not knowing what to do with yatora for a while now, but this arc has amplified that in a way i find difficult to reconcile with the stronger arcs that other characters got. i think i said in another cc re: yamaguchi’s writing that yatora has been recycling the same themes since the early chapters. murai’s words for him in blp 49 are the same things that ooba told him years ago, for example. yatora’s inability to read others keeps being the crux of every character arc; it’s in everything from the lesson about shibuya he got from murai to him being surprised that “yotasuke-kun is human” to him realizing for the first time during the part-time arc that hashida is actually colder than he believed. having a flawed protagonist used to be a particular strength in blp, but it’s just… tiring, at this point, to actually look at the bigger picture and see no movement. this current arc had all the facilities to address it, and while i love yatora’s guilt assignment and kuwana’s own role in him learning about community in art, it’s just a big "okay..." overall for me. it’s unfortunate. <br><br>callout exposé or not, this arc has had my stomach churning for (checks calendar) seven months now. and if anything cut the final thread, it was yesterday’s chapter. i do think i’ll still be reading and tuning in, just not with more subdued emotional attachment. i’ll always be open to discussing it, and i remain fond of the fics i wrote for it. it’s just a different relationship now. that’s fine. i’m not cutting it off completely, and the criticisms i have now are criticisms i’ve always had. nothing hostile/scathing here at all. it's still a solid, well-drawn work, and i remain objective on that much, if nothing else.</div>

 <div class=reply>i feel you so much ahhh i consume poems a lot like how i consume paintings, which is just — i stand in front of it. prolonged eye contact. and once i look away, i think — okay, does it linger with me? in my mind, in my chest? <br><br>that said, i do think trying to look at poems/paintings from an intellectual standpoint yields little benefits in the long run. plus if you have to go farther than halfway to meet a thing eye to eye, that tends to just be incompatibility between you and the creator/the work. it’s okay. the more you force yourself to like a poem, the more you start conditioning yourself to see poetry as something you are forced to think your way into liking. which should never be the case with anything. so this is me gently patting you on the hand to say — i hope you don’t prioritize understanding poems over forming a rs with poems you vibe with, full stop. i know that sounds vague and pretentious but i’m a firm believer that understanding comes second after love. understanding is what you do with the love. meaning you can’t exactly understand your way into loving anything. you can’t skip the first step.<br><br>so — no, i don’t have tips on academically interpreting poems. but i can tell u what i like in poems? there’s a section here (https://bit.ly/3z5OQk1) where i talk about my basic favs, you can just skip to it, but here’s one i included in a recent fic bc i fell in love with it immediately: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/the-years<br><br>things i intuitively loved about this poem: how it just goes and goes and goes. how it has some kind of A Vibe to it. the conversational tone. how it feels like floating to listen. so then i examined why i loved these things, and i chalk it up to minimal punctuation, how some phrases are longer before it hits you with the melancholy of a staccato sentence. how the poem feels like time itself, collapsing around you. <br><br>my tl;dr is: allow yourself to love poems by allowing yourself to hate poems. listen to poetry podcasts like the slowdown and poetry unbound, if that will help you understand what accomplished poets see in the poems they love. mainstream contemporary / modernist poets tend to be more accessible in finding what kind of poems you’re into. ada limón, richard siken, mary oliver. social media favs for a reason. and as for a good intro to unpacking how much language can fit in a verse — i kid you not, shakespeare is where it’s at. <br><br> if you feel nothing for a poem, that’s fine. look at the next one. and when you find a poem you like, that doesn’t just make you think “meh” — you can finally think okay, why do i like it? is it the way the words wash over me? is it bc the imagery is so clear? is it bc it feels intimate? and i think that’s really the most understanding we can ask for in the art we consume, at least in the beginning.</div>

 <div class=reply>this made me unironically think to myself “oh wow, how much in-depth knowledge of sha lore does one need to possess to ask this specific question?” which is mortifying and borderline narcissistic of me To me, personally, but cheers to you my friend cheers to you and tysm for this question it made me smile in surprise yet also sit down like rodin’s the thinker<br><br>but alright see there’s my left brain ranking, then there’s my right brain ranking. left brain ranking takes into consideration my thoughts and feelings about narrative, writing style, characterization, plotting, surface approach vs. how much depth it actually pulled off, all of that fun stuff. and the right brain ranking… is basically the intensity with which i thought “damn, this is what i want all stories to do to me” upon finishing it for the first time.<br><br>this is the left brain ranking, which i lowkey think is the better, more accurate, more holistic ranking: <br><br>➀ the goldfinch <br>➁ real life<br>➂ sea of tranquility<br>➃ the heart’s invisible furies<br>➄ the kite runner<br><br>(real life and sot are so close that they’re basically interchangeable, though, honestly)<br><br>and this is the “barely any thoughts, head 90% empty, the remaining 10% are just vibes, which makes this pretty much 100% gut reaction” right brain ranking:<br><br>➀ sea of tranquility<br>➁ the heart’s invisible furies<br>➂ the kite runner<br>➃ the goldfinch<br>➄ real life<br><br>also — i wanna say note the ages that i first read each book !! kite runner (8), the goldfinch (16), the heart’s invisible furies (19), real life and sea of tranquility (24) bc i feel like the period where i was at as both a person and a ✨ writer ✨ greatly informs the feelings a book i find good leaves with me, you know? <br><br>ahhhh this really was so much more difficult than i'd expected at first glance ?? i'm looking at real life especially and man it doesn't deserve that last place in the right brain ranking. it Did get gut reactions out of me. i can feel my heart speeding up and slowing down right now just thinking about it. and the sheer warm-hearted emptiness the goldfinch left me with after is irreplaceable. it just so happened that the top three made me internally sob in a way that felt primal by comparison. but it really is like comparing my fav dishes from diff cuisines to each other. just bc i don't cry tears of joy each time i eat sisig doesn't mean i love it less than kamja tang. books are like that. i am bettered by every good book i manage to finish let alone feel for as i am every good meal. this is the point of you making me rank them, though, isn't it, that it would be difficult? 😅 <br><br>so again. thank you for paying attention to me in this capacity, and for taking the time to drop by with this q :)</div>

 <div class=reply>my rule of thumb is that the answer to “will i survive ___?” is always yes. even when you don’t think you will, or you don’t end up surviving it the way you thought you would, or you do survive it but barely, the answer is always yes. i know it’s hard and exhausting and i can only imagine that everything feels amplified to the magnitude of something world-ending at that age, but speaking as someone much older than you are, there have been plenty of things that i was beyond certain i wouldn’t survive. yet here i am, typing this reply to you. it’s not bc i was more resilient or resourceful. i think i’m here for the simple, inevitable reason that i just kept living life. and the things i didn’t think i’d survive are all shapes in the past, sometimes vague, sometimes vivid, but my point is that every time i thought i was close to the end, i never was. bc the end was never actually the end, for better or for worse. all i had to do was get to that point, and the rest, the next arc or chapter, started forming in front of me. <br><br>but i also know that’s a lot of romantic ideas thrown at someone who’s probably just so sick of it all at this point in hs. i also can’t begin to imagine everything you have going on within this year. my only practical advice is… let time pass. whatever you have to do to let time keep trudging on. that said, i’m not telling you to endure beyond your capacities. how you feel comes first — but also don’t sell yourself short and stop at the first opportunity when you can keep going. you’re right. you Are so close to the end. it’s even more overwhelming bc this is the first real “end” of a period of your life. but you’ll get there. take it one thing at a time. pass this class, then that class. take a break from this, find time with friends there. break life down into the small moments. or at least that’s how i’ve survived the big things, until eventually the things that worry me have been cut up into such small chunks that i myself don’t feel small next to it. and that’s really what counts. don’t let anything make you feel small. the things that do, cut them down to manageable bites. and if that doesn’t end up working in the end, and say, you have to do another class or another year while everyone else finishes hs — so what? it’s not the end of the world. it really isn’t. it might make your next path a bit less straightforward than you expected, but again — so what? you get to adulthood, to the rest of your life, and it won’t matter how you got here, just that you did. i can vouch for that much. <br><br>i’m sorry i can’t give you more substantial ~advice. i’m really, truly wishing you all the best.</div>

 <div class=reply>not at all! not even a little bit. it’s very kind of you to say that, thank you, but i think i’m quite stupid, actually. that’s not a word i use jokingly, nor a word i say scathingly. i don’t consider myself helpless or inefficient or unreliable or incompetent. that much, i know i’m not. i just think i’m quite… stupid. you can make a case for me being street-smart at best but with that in mind i really am just book-stupid, and have no remorse about deeming other people stupid. i’m not one of those people who can just projectile vomit a bunch of informative knowledge on a broad range of subjects or quote from this specific book by that author. that’s what i’d consider well-read. like murai from blue period, whom i love for a lot of reasons but one of them is that so far he seems to have a reliable ability to navigate textbook information vs. just pure gut feeling, which to me is the mark of intelligence that matters. <br><br>by contrast, i’m nothing but pure gut feeling. i’ve read books, obviously, but i can never be one of those people who read books for the sake of some higher pursuit of intelligence. i just read what i want to, and i have opinions and values, but that leaves me a person who can only run on intuition and resourcefulness and memory that comes and goes as it pleases. i have a lot of opinions and have travelled a fair bit in terms of the media i consume, sure, but everything i’ve ever said or done stems only from intuition or impulse or accumulation of all the phases and fixations i’ve had — but not any kind of deliberate academic knowledge. i think i’d wither away if i had to be put in a room and told what books to read and memorize. someone can argue this is a kind of intelligence in its own way, what i’ve got, but it doesn’t really matter too much, i don’t think. it certainly won’t make me change my ways whether or not i’m considered well-read or stupid. i’m too lazy for someone so hungry for things to stimulate me. <br><br>again, thank you so much for your kind words, but the tl;dr answer is no, i absolutely do not consider myself well-read — and that is more than okay, i promise! just means i can always stand to read more and know more, and isn’t that great?</div>

 <div class=reply>i really liked it! i feel more personally invested this time around — not bc i wasn’t invested in csm part 1 but that felt more… objectively good? sometimes you consume a thing and you’re like yup that’s good bc you can see what the author was trying to do and you can give it a thumbs up and go “nice. very nice.” that’s how i felt about csm part 1. but i was just telling a friend the other day that my tastes and fujimoto’s narrative/metaphor tendencies have been kinda running parallel to each other so far, just these two lines almost on the same wavelength but not meeting, and it’s only recently, beginning with look back and peaking with sayonara eri, that they’re starting to overlap. so csm part 2, or at least that first chapter, felt like the first moment of intersection. like ah yes i get you and you get me and now we can explore Your exploration together. i’ll be seated not just as an objective consumer watching a creator work but as literally a subjective human being with personal emotions to hand over. which is super exciting. <br><br>i also just trust fujimoto. not the theses/themes of his stories necessarily or unconditionally but bc as i was saying to someone yesterday i think he’s figuring this stuff out as much as we are. but that’s exactly what i trust, if nothing else. he seems to be okay taking his time and going at his own pace to figure out what he wants to be doing, or at least that’s the vibe i’ve gotten from him splitting csm into parts + how every oneshot since has felt like little trial runs for explorations of the same collection of ideas. i’m personally invested now bc i’m invested in how he’ll be exploring stuff this time, now that he’s had time to gear up for it and do some trial and error. it’s always exciting (and terrifying, but exciting bc it’s terrifying) when a creator is on the cusp of something. <br><br>i also do wonder a little how a mangaka will approach war themes, and on that front especially i remain cautious, bc how will you tackle this as a creator in a country both irreversibly impacted by nuclear war AND responsible for many of the most inhumane atrocities committed during WWII, while also actively contributing and profiting off being a political soft power as a literal manga writer — you know what i mean? it’s a lot of layers to navigate. so when i say i’m cautious, i’m also just curious.</div>

 <div class=question>how do u cope with regrets</div>

 <div class=reply>i think — and i’m sorry for not having a gentler way to put this — that regrets tend to be a thing that occupies people who’ve had the luxury of imagining success or perfection. that’s not a bad thing, but usually when someone regrets something, it’s bc their supposed failure to do a thing has had what feels like a life-altering effect on them, enough that they wish they could take it back. and the thing is — i feel like i’ve lived a lot of my life doing damage control. damage control for people i’m supposed to love without crisis attached, damage control for the things that my own mental health situation has taken from me, damage control for the mistakes i have to make bc sometimes that’s the only thing that will even teach me how to do smth. and so — idk if i see regrets the same way as you would, maybe, as someone who sees them as a thing to “cope” with. i certainly don’t see my mistakes as regrets. regret feels very abstract while mistakes are… mistakes. they’re tangible. i see them as damage, yes, but after damage comes the chance to do damage control. and once you rob yourself of the ability to attempt an aftermath to damage you caused, once you let regrets occupy you to the point that they govern your life, then to me that’s letting damage stay as damage. <br><br>idk. it’s different for each case. you gave me only a fragment of a question without even a punctuation, so idk details, but while i do think you’re allowed to grieve whatever it is you want to take back or wish you’d have done differently — when it comes to regrets, to me, either you did it and that’s that, or you didn’t and that’s that. either way, what’s done is done. i could tell you to be kinder to yourself, to allow yourself to sit with your regrets and shake their hand like you’re meeting a new friend and to make peace with your heart that way, and all these are important, but from my own personal perspective, all i have to say is that you cope with regrets by accepting that they stem from smth real, and then you go and pursue smth even realer. i personally am not a fan of conceptual solutions to the problems that life gives us, so i mean this literally. you do wrong, so then you do better. you don’t try, so then you try harder. you bend without breaking. the more you wallow staring down the damage you created, the less you’re actually doing smth about it. and ofc many things in life, you’ll never be able to take back. but i don’t see why that has to have any bearing on the things you Could do. it’s hard, not being able to fix things. i know. but you cope with that the way you cope with anything. by living anyway, by moving on and growing up, and finding things in life that will let you do right by them. or at least that’s what i think, to give a subjective but ultimately insufficient answer.</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m rereading those tweets right now bc to be honest with u i haven’t even thought about them since and hmm i wonder what i meant <br><br>i think mostly i’ve just struggled lately to feel like these spaces are completely true to who i am? not bc i feel like i have to pretend on them, but bc they feel like they only capture half if not a quarter of what i want to be giving. i feel insufficient for them and on them. it isn’t that i feel like i’m transitioning to a different stage of life — i’m Always transitioning to a different stage of something, we all are, etc — so much as it feels… like a weight. to carry. these spaces. cityboys, especially. i’m happy here on sleeptowns, and i’d love to not have to create a new pseud, but sometimes it feels like i’m fooling all of you somehow by claiming these names? idk? like i’m convincing you all that i’m this knowledgeable, kind person when i don’t feel like i am that at all, you know? and so these spaces feel representative of a person that i’m not, and here i am using them like they’re mine. that sort of thing. a disconnect and all, and i’m not the best at navigating the discomfort that such dissonance gives me. <br><br>i think it’s natural for people to have all these relationships with my words and my fics and i know that when i send out something to the world, it’s no longer mine alone. that’s the whole Point to it. i’m eternally grateful and i know i’m lucky that language isn’t just an isolated tool but a way to literally communicate. i just feel like there are times when i give something out to the world and it’s taken out of my hands too quick. it makes me feel unanchored instead of connected to anything or anyone. and that’s tricky, some nights. i don’t want you all to see me as some kind of reliably accomplished figure bc then i’d feel like a fraud, but i also want to be doing better by all of you. even if better can only mean answering ccs more wisely, or being mindful and grateful that i have readers at all, or replying to comments even if going on ao3 or yt or substack can feel rather overwhelming bc wow why are you all perceiving me, a nobody. i just wish it didn’t feel overwhelming. that’s really all it is. i’m working on it. i’m figuring it out. it’s a lot of responsibility, having all these places to put my words into, and sometimes i just don’t feel like the right kind of responsible person for it. i’ve really let myself go on my priv twt recently, and i think mostly i just feel the discrepancy between there and here. but again! working on it! <br><br>really did not mean to dump all this on you omg i’m doing okay, just being melodramatic about the nature of online spaces. i hope you’re as well as can be too sweet stranger :)</div>

 <div class=reply>PERFECT TIMING I AM JUST ABSOLUTELY CONSUMED BY IT AT THE MOMENT<br><br>i’m still working through S2, and idk if i’ll have to read the light novels after that and if i do, i will — but god what is it about the most gorgeous things being severely underrated. i feel this way about the witch and the beast, too, which still astounds me when i remember it doesn’t have a huge following, but it’s always the things i start bc of a gut feeling that i’ll love it that surprises me even more than i already figured it would. dance dance danseur, sea of tranquility, the devotion of suspect x — and now 86. it’s making me really appreciate for the first time just going at my own pace and trusting my own instincts in media consumption. <br><br>but anyway. i digress. i’m loving 86 a lot. i’m really savouring the viewing experience. i don’t even skip the openings, or skip the endings to get to the post-credits scenes. it’s just so… stellarly visual? like yes, it has some of the most cinematic compositions i’ve ever seen in an anime, and kudos to all the storyboarders bc damn some of those shot choices you haven’t even seen in film in a while. but on top of that, it also relies so much on images and sound more so than anything else, and i just really appreciate that in any visual work. you won’t even think it was adapted from a light novel, bc all the themes 86 conveys best, it does so without need for traditional exposition/dialogue. the best example off the top of my head rn is one of those final scenes in S1 where lena has these drawings of the spearhead kids in front of her and the camera pans to each one as they’re talking. i was just Marvelling at how it’d be so easy for the director(s) to rely on your usual on-the-nose markers to show how these literal child soldiers have been dehumanized, yet 86 still finds ways to convey stuff like this in a way wholly its own. and sound team + sawano hiroyuki are delivering like hell. man. i just have a lot of respect for the storytelling.<br><br>that said, i do think the themes suffer a tiny bit from me watching it now and not when it first came out? it’s a little like black mirror in that sense, where the depth of these themes would have hit a lot harder in earlier years but now closely mirror the present, urgent state of the world, to the point that it lends the fictional world of 86 a fantastically idyllic lens that i assume it wouldn’t have necessarily had before. it doesn’t bother me too much, though. <br><br>i’m running out of space but the last thing i’ll say is: i feel and think a lot about how ptsd/being a military veteran are being explored in S2 so far. otherwise, i’ll refrain from rambling any more until i catch up/finish it. <br><br>tysm for asking and giving me the space to gush 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oh not at all, but it's nothing especially... insurgent? it's not some anti-establishment choice, really. it’s just a bunch of things i’ve taken issue with in the past several months — those massive staff layoffs, the new policies about sharing accounts, all the cancelled shows, the way it’s gotten to a point where it leaves a sour aftertaste to witness the areas they invest in at the expense of the ones that need actual better work. so when they did that price hike not too long ago, it just kinda felt like an easy choice to finally cut my subscription. it’s like… when you can feel a company on its last breath, and it’s obvious to everyone else what they can be doing to save themselves but the people in charge are doing the exact opposite. and it’s just painful to see it happen, so you look the other way, retract your hands, all of that. even though yeah they’re still a company and quite a big corporate presence as a streaming giant and anything with a monopoly in the media market is a bad thing — at the end of the day, it’s more that i’m not upstanding enough of a human being to want to be around to watch a sinking ship disappear under the water? that, and i’d never enjoyed my netflix options much anyway, originals or otherwise. i kept it for some animes, and sometimes they’ll have a movie right up my alley, but it’s just not a price i can keep justifying when i have other bills to pay, you know? i'll watch netflix shows that intrigued me and i have access to, sure, and i just watched midnight mass with a friend who has netflix — but otherwise, while i i wish i could say it was an important anti-corporation choice or whatever, it’s really just a personal one 🥲</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh that would be very cool for me as well! i think that story is so unhinged — and like. literally, not even metaphorically. there’s so much that happens and there are so many parts that had even me going “i don’t think my writing has done that before?” + it was my first time trying a handful of the writing genres in it. i had so much fun writing it overall, even when i was on my knees on the floor, but it really does baffle me how i finished it. <br><br>but what i’m trying to say is i’d certainly have much to gain from writing an autopsy report! while i don’t have the immediate time right now (and i still have to finish the second part of the flls report, now that you’ve reminded me), it will definitely be on my mind so tysm for this message 🌀✨</div>

 <div class=reply>this had me doing a little soul-searching whoa… but i think maybe i’ll always fall for a variation of the “i know you can be more than what you currently are” sort of dynamic? something about seeing past not just someone’s personal facade but also seeing above what other people see in this one person. that belief in their capacity to be more and, in having that, also a belief in the inevitability of them becoming that person. there’s so much that appeals to me about believing in someone’s inherent capability to surpass even this current self. whether this plays out in a magical world or about a sport — doesn’t matter. i find myself drawn towards dynamics that start off with a bit of tension or edge in how they regard each other’s competence or goodness or whatever it is in context, which i think is quite reflective of how i find myself disliking unconditional love or even just any kind of praise unthinkingly given.</div>

 <div class=reply>a few! mostly canadian ones, and among them, hazlitt is my fav, with room as a close second. they function more as a literary magazines than really literary journals, though. but i did a panel last month with a local college’s literary review, so i’ve been getting more into journals/review publications like the new quarterly and pulp literature. i’ve also been collecting the carousel for a few copies now, and ofc i remain subscribed to the paris review.</div>

 <div class=reply>that… is the nicest, warmest description ever wow thank you so much for listening to me at this little sun-warmed cafe table in all ways except physical :( but also i most certainly don’t have the answers to everything !! i just rant too much !!! like i’m seriously starting to feel guilty about tweeting at all that i’m probably subjecting my priv tl to worse so if anything thank you for humouring me at times like this 🤍<br><br>but also ahhh i think i deleted this thread bc my rambling got so out of control but i tweeted once about my ridiculous amount of love for junpei, and smth about what s1 and yamashita daiki’s voice acting choices did with him just tripled that love? like… there’s so much around the innate talent vs hard work theme introduced by this trope of having a newcomer to a sport/craft be the protagonist in a series, but junpei’s identity never feels secondary to the story. in a lot of sports animes, the sport itself binds characters to each other and functions as both motivation and metaphor for everything the story would need to convey. it’s also true for art in blp, for example. in a narrative like that, the protagonist is the protagonist bc their existence IS the narrative. their characterization and their arc and their growth are a stand-in for the story itself. you take for granted why the protag would choose art/volleyball/wtv but you also never question why that thing would choose the protag back. you just assume it will, with enough growth and hard work. <br><br>but junpei feels real not just bc he has motivations and dreams like other protagonists but bc he has had a life outside of ballet. you see a childhood defined by daydreaming through movies translated into an almost scary capacity to disappear into a role he’s dancing. you Get why ballet would want him. instead of rejecting what came before he gave it all up for ballet and tossing it aside once it no longer serves the premise, junpei’s jeet kune do bg gives rise to his strengths in dance. his characterization isn’t interchangeable with plot points. i think my initial thread said smth about how as a protagonist, he’s like water or air, not a ray of sunshine or a heartbreakingly human mirror. he’s subject to the story as much as everyone else is. yet he has so much presence onscreen. i love how terrifyingly rich the anime made him out to be, more so than the quieter version of him on the page.<br><br>i just think the ddd anime interpreted a lot of things so well, but junpei’s character is by far the most notable expansion. it’s really made me reflect on what makes a good central character and why? he’s a real person, and it makes all his dynamics so real too. it’s so fascinating how the relationships in ddd are positioned.<br><br>but anyway i’m typing this on sleep meds and will regret not making sense when i wake up but again thank you for indulging me and for being so generous.</div>

 <div class=reply>ohhh writing is great for this kind of question bc there are ways to kinda… soft launch it into your life? the path to a writing career isn’t very linear or set in stone, and every person i know who does it for a living has gotten there with such a distinctly specific path.with writing, i’d say what’s most crucial is pursuing opportunities to write more and more, which i think is the only way anyone can really get ~better anyway. <br><br>with all that said, you don’t have to commit to a writing career all at once! i don’t think you really Can, even. whether it’s fiction or nonfiction you want to write, i’d suggest looking into smaller places you can submit writing to. independent publications &amp; little online zines usually have themed issues, and tend to be very exact about their submission guidelines, and i think having those can be helpful for writers just getting a feel of how the industry works. ofc you can try for bigger publications, but i say smaller in particular only bc there’s a higher chance of having substantial one on one time with the publication’s editor(s), which can give you an idea of how the writing workflow (really just the back and forth between editor &amp; writer across drafts) operates, as well as how payments and release schedules and all of that work. it’s kind of tricky to explain unless you’ve gone through a publication’s workflow, but it’s also actually more structured than people outside of the writing industry might assume. <br><br>i’d say the most difficult part of trying to break into writing for a living is just… getting used to how much waiting it requires? plus the bigger the publication, the more likely they are to not get back to you at all if they don’t pick your submission for publishing. so it can be a lot of radio silence and uncertainty, especially if you don’t have other things keeping you busy, so if that’s not a lifestyle you feel compatible with, that might be an element to consider. otherwise, just write and write and pitch and pitch and submit and submit. it might seem boring or tedious but i’ve found that even the pitch and/or query writing has gotten fun. again, writing is luckily one of those things you only get better at the more you do it, and so the only requisite path towards a career is to just… do it, as simplistic as that sounds. to put it in rather clinical terms, you’ll want to build up your portfolio no matter what your writing end goal is, and that portfolio alone is worth much more than you’d expect, not just for the editors/agents you’ll be pitching, or for author bios, but also for your own growth. <br><br>as for book recs ahhh i don’t read a lot of books about writing nearly enough, but i did enjoy ursula k. le guin’s conversations on writing, with david naimon as interviewer and editor.</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha, i hope you’ve been feeling better lately &lt;3<br><br>yesterday i woke up to the news that a creator i thought fondly of passed away. i was extremely shocked. i could feel bits of me slowly falling apart. but in the midst of my unraveling i thought of that one letter from your newsletter. every time i had a thought like, “but how am i supposed to explain how utterly struck i feel despite not knowing him personally? is that okay? is this too much? isn’t it wrong to have no explanation for how intense these feelings feel?” i kept thinking back to your letter, but i only vaguely remembered what it said.<br><br>so i just reread it, and god that letter is so heartwarming as much as it is heart wrenching as well. i felt very comforted and validated by it. and i hope things have been easier for you to deal with lately i really do. we are so human and we’re so full of love and so many emotions, crazy how we forget how mortal we really are when we get so busy. i hope you get the things you wished for in that letter and more i just think you’re genuine and kind.<br><br>i guess i don’t have a question, just a thank you &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t know for a fact if this creator of yours — and he is yours, one way or another, and i don’t think you should ever discount the amount of things his passing has made you feel — has anything to do with technoblade, but a friend who thought fondly of him showed me a video of this creator’s father reading a letter to his subscribers after he passed a couple days ago, and while i didn’t know technoblade’s content at all, personally or even passively, i’ve still felt all the weight of seeing people mourn him through their tweets and tributes, and was moved to tears by that video that my friend showed me. so i think, for someone like me, a stranger and outsider to all this, to be hit by the impact of this loss and feel for it in my own way — i can only imagine what it must be like for those who knew his content. whether or not the creator you’re grieving is indeed technoblade, i can also only imagine how it must be for you to lose a creator who was in your life in a significant way.<br><br>i feel very comforted in turn to hear that a letter validated your feelings, bc if there’s one thing i wanna say to you rn, cliche as it is, it’s that… they Are valid? i’m sure you know that, and i speak a lot about how careful we have to be with parasocial dynamics, but to know someone through their content and for that content and therefore them to mean a lot to you — that’s just as human as it gets, especially in today’s age. for us to acknowledge that yes, this person is merely a figure in our lives, it isn’t a personal one-on-one knowing, and yet for the impersonal shape of that presence to matter anyway, maybe even bc they’re merely a figure — that’s so substantial. i don’t think it’s wrong to have no explanation. the explanation is that there’s no explanation. grief is so huge that it’s its own logic, and we’re allowed to sink into it when we remember not just our own mortality but the mortality of someone that to us has unconsciously always been so immoveable from our lives. <br><br>so. thank you so much for beginning and ending your message with such kindness and thoughtfulness despite all that i’m sure you came to articulate. it means a lot more than you know, to receive these well wishes. i don’t know if i’m remotely close to being as genuine or kind as you say, but forms of grief like this, i can definitely understand. i’m very sorry for your loss, and i also hope you’re doing better lately.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no not silly at all, i promise i really like interesting questions like this! but also this might be silly of me in turn, but i don’t… often… register whether i like someone’s face until something else about them has caught my attention, fictional or irl. i really have to do a second look after i hear someone’s voice, or they end up being especially knowledgeable in a topic, that sort of thing. going back again to my answer to your last cc; i guess that applies in how i see people too. not even in the edgy “breast or thigh? personality.” kind of way, it’s really just a matter of voice and/or purpose in speaking. i can probably realize someone’s actually quite stunning somewhere down the line but it will all still be ruined if they’re the most needlessly obnoxious voice in any room, or if every conversation i have with them just feels one-sided, you know what i mean? idk how to phrase that without sounding like an “i hate small talk” tiktoker. but ahhh this def ties into me just not being very attracted to people, so take my answers to mean that i just find them aesthetically pleasing. <br><br>with that — ana de armas, definitely, definitely, definitely. i couldn’t focus every time she was onscreen in blade runner 2049. natalia dyer and hamabe minami are both also so lovely to me. winter from aespa recently went back to blond hair and i think she looks Stunning. this current generation of kpop idols are all so glossy in their own ways, and i’ve always thought in passing that winter has such a delicate prettiness to her, but i loved this look on her in particular: https://youtu.be/MIYBc4ighfo. the short blond hair in this recent comeback is such a good look, too. and i would like to see alisha boe, kathryn newton, emilijia baranac and manny jacinto in more things truthfully so i can also just look at them more. here and there i am not immune at all to dev patel, alex fitzalan, keith powers &amp; jacob elordi. and also idris elba is idris elba. <br><br>as for fictional works, i think everyone in witch and the beast is just spellbindingly gorgeous. the art in itself is already mesmerizing, but all the characters in the series’ style are so beautiful i’d use up my phone storage if i saved every panel of someone looking pretty. i’ve also always felt a lot of what the kids might call gender envy now about kaworu from the nge franchise, i think. <br><br>but wow your qs are really making me reflect on things i don’t think i’ve paid attention to before, so thank you so much for sending both messages 💗</div>

 <div class=reply>what an interesting question! my comfort actors have been helen mirren and paul dano for a while now, so they’re the first to come to mind. it’s a pity they both star in such few movies i’d want to watch, though i’m glad paul got some recognition in the new batman, but i have a lot of love and respect for how they conduct themselves in interviews and such. they both have very soft voices paired with introspective cadences, and it just puts me at ease to listen to them talk with such purpose. i love seeing people with such… thought and respect for the weight of words? quite often with actors they pay a lot of attention to the energy they put forward and out into the world, and there’s this requisite consciousness of what they’re saying and how they’re saying it, which in itself is purpose, but at least from my perspective helen mirren and paul dano both have an internal-ness to them. their consciousness of their words and actions is rooted in something interior, hidden from view. and so there’s a palpable calm and composure to how they carry themselves. i value that a lot.<br><br>oh, and i'm also obsessed with meenoi! i think i've only talked about her on main once, but that's my girl. her youtube channel brings me so much comfort, i have a playlist dedicated just to her songs, i have watched every episode of her cooking talk show, etc. i don't know how to describe her particular appeal to me, exactly, but i just find her very refreshing, and her music very soothing. her imovie style of editing her videos is also so charming to me. i've watched nearly all her covers so much, but i've contributed a truly unhealthy amount to this one in particular: https://youtu.be/jMbT1v1RUDs<br><br>i’m really coming up blank beyond these three, wow. i tend to gravitate towards voices a lot, though! if i like a celebrity, it’s most likely bc i love listening to them speak or how they carry themselves in conversation and/or introspection. i listen to enoki junya’s podcast for jjk a lot, for instance. my current fav k-idol rn is gaeul from ive. and i love people who are able to articulate their relationship with their craft very well, like anya taylor-joy and sally rooney in her london review bookshop panel, or people who are able to carry out conversations that are both grounded and empathetic, like this video of park jinyoung: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DXLjcLhipo&amp;t=385s&amp;ab_channel=DingoK-Drama. <br><br>i don’t know why i’m just describing these without having more names to back it all up, but it’s 4am here and i’m not the best at remembering things i like on a good day, so i really do apologize for not having more to offer :(</div>

 <div class=question>hey! dropping by to say that i know you’ve mentioned before that you don’t know what your writing style is – even though ppl say you do have one –, but i was reading your third huckleberry newsletter earlier today and it struck me how similar your writing style there is to donna tartt’s in the goldfinch!!!! something about the descriptions, i think, although i’m not so confident in affirming that it’s the same for your other works—i think that things are a tad different when it comes to flls, for example, but i could definitely see some of tartt’s own writing there!<br>(taylor swift’s you are what you love lyric in daylight being exemplified in broad daylight here 😵‍💫👍)</div>

 <div class=reply>had to run to my newsletter to see what the third one was and oh !!!! thank you so much, whoa. i wonder if it was the art talk that drew up similarities for you, that’s So interesting. i don’t know if i’m anywhere near donna tartt’s command of her prose — she’s one of the authors i think of when i try to imagine whose prose i find genuinely beautiful in the traditional understanding of aesthetic beauty — but that just means it means the world to hear someone say i come even a smidge close to her. there’s a polish to her capital r romantic style of writing that feels very timeless, and i know it’s not necessarily the prose style for me, bc i don’t think my writing is quite as sophisticated, but i’m super comforted to know the influences are at least there. even if unconsciously, she might have been one of the first writers to get me to write with this lengthy flow i have now, or whatever is definitive in my ~style, so — really, completely, thank you so much for taking the time to leave me this cc 🥲</div>

 <div class=reply>are you, by any chance, the same person who sent in this cc https://curiouscat.me/sleeptowns/post/1282140712? <br><br>no i’m kidding maybe you are, maybe not, but it’s a really good question and i stand by what i said in that reply! if i had the money to barely exist for a couple months, unknown and unreachable, that would be all i can ever ask for, right now and always. i’m a very easy to satiate traveler, in the sense that i’m not much of a traveler at all. traveling to me is ideally living my same homebody life in another place and eating their food. if i had the money to cover it, i’d stay in a new city and only leave when it doesn’t feel new and unknowable anymore. but if i don’t have to worry about keeping my living expenses solely for living, i think i’d like to take a local class for a skill i’ve always wanted to try but don’t have the time or finances for… maybe piloting a helicopter, or archery, or a martial art. take a baking or cooking class, maybe, but idk. a lot of the things i’d love to do would require me to be social, which defeats the point of doing whatever i wanted for once. i really just want to be a workaholic recluse somewhere and put work into some hobbies in between. being out in the world with people wears me out much more than any actual work, i’d say. so if i can buy comfortable solitude with money, i absolutely would.</div>

 <div class=reply>hi omg thank you for being so attentive to my tastes and replies! i gave sasha alex sloan a few listens just now and did recognize some of her most popular songs, and i totally, totally see why she would be adjacent to the music i listen to. i don’t think she’s quite exactly what i look for in songs that stay with me, but i love the vibe her music gives off. feels like the kind of music just right for a long-distance road trip with a car full of people. tysm for thinking of me and dropping by with this msg 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oh i am so happy to be asked :( <br><br>idk how substantial my thoughts are, really, but the ruou study popped into my head bc a friend joked that barring the fact that they’re cousins, both ruou and miyako have more chemistry with junpei than each other. i promise i’m not trying to be purposefully obtuse about why ruou and miyako’s dynamic is what it is, but you know — you look at a character and zero in on a loose thread, and once you tug on that, everything else you know about them readily unravels to form a whole new perspective. so, in a hypothetical ruou study, i thought about how — there is so much that ruou has internalized, and i often consider how for him ballet and gender are so entwined. his ballet training hasn’t just been in the shadow of his mother, but his whole rship with it is with having taken mazuru’s literal place. ddd doesn’t get too much into the difference between ballerinas vs danseurs, but as if ruou’s training wasn’t traumatic enough, his growing body was forced into the shape of his mother, literally and metaphorically, and yes, it made him good, but if ballet is smth he’s internalized as inherently traumatic, then i imagine it’s also applicable to his rship with gender, and by extension, his rship with sexuality. not that gender and sexuality are to be conflated at all, but in ruou’s case, you can wager that there’s no separation bw these two and ballet. <br><br>ofc this isn’t a fleshed out idea bc i never know what smth will turn out to be unless i write it, but — i think canon as it is indicates that ruou is only so attached and ~in love with miyako bc he’s Such a textbook example of what an anxious attachment style does to someone and she happened to be the first person he could feel safe with. even junpei understood that. but using that as a foundation, i think there’s a reading of ruou that allows for some internalized homophobia, if only bc he’s clearly wrestling with the qualities that made him his mother’s replacement. that isn’t all he is, but it’s what he knows, and if i were given the variables that ddd has, i think it will only take a slight nudge to entertain ruou moving steadily from reexamining the nature of his feelings about his cousin and reflecting on what it means to be — a boy who maybe loves boys, whether or not it’s junpei that prompts those epiphanies. bc then ruou also has to think about where a boy who loves boys could be positioned in the world of ballet, where he’ll always be a danseur and never his ex ballerina mother. that’s the ideal catharsis i want for ruou, in a study — that path towards release from the things chaining down his rship with ballet, and therefore release from the things chaining down his rship with himself. a reexamining of what he loves and why, and therefore also who he loves and why.<br><br>but again !! very limited and unfleshed out !! but tysm for being interested i have so much i can say about s1 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>i have! i liked it, i did cry, and i completely understand why it moved so many others. all the variations on narratives like this is already a great thing, but it’s even better to see it expanded to such an ambitiously stylistic scale. the capacity to film such a movie in a way that utilizes every portion of what makes a great movie and a great movie alone—not a novel, not a play—is what makes eeaao singular, i think. it took the multiverse trend and made it solely an immigrant mother &amp; her daughter’s coming of age story, and i can only imagine the brainstorming work that went into it. tonally, it had everything from heartfelt to comedic to absurd to life-affirming, and i think it was a movie that’s needed now more than ever. to restore faith in ourselves, yes, but also in what cinema can and should try to do.<br><br>that said, while i think it’s a wonderfully intricate movie on the stylistic front, i just wasn’t… knocked off my feet by what the narrative came down to? not what it is, but what it came down to. i know people love the laundromat line and the rocks scenes + that the portrayal of the rship between evelyn &amp; joy resonated with many—and this isn’t me discounting that at all. it means a lot to have things like this, and just bc i’m not capital i impressed doesn’t mean i didn’t appreciate it and what it stood for. but for me… it’s one of those cases where the dialogue had to do a lot of telling more so than anything was doing the showing, bc the showing was busy balancing all these multiversal graphic match cuts and timeline jumping. so yes, i loved a lot of the beautiful exchanges between multiple dynamics, and the actors all did so So well, but if you really get down in the dirt with what each line is worth, what does it really weigh against what the narrative has shown us? if you pare down the stylistic stuff, what are we left with in the bare bones of the dynamics that exist? what were we shown before we were told? were the right things prioritized, even in a multiverse sized story? or was the dialogue just ideas filtered through suggestions of characters—which we embrace and appreciate anyway, bc they’re characters in a context unlike anything we’ve seen or gotten before, but i’m not exactly foaming at the mouth in love with the actual story and thesis statements the movie offered. i see why it got people, i recognize &amp; respect the writers’ tricks and instincts, but mostly i know that it works bc people today Needed to be told the things that eeaao fed them. that’s worth a lot.<br><br>at best, i think the daniels just went for things proven already good &amp; valuable and repackaged it into their style, and in today’s climate, the existence of the movie is in itself significant enough as it is. overall, i appreciate eeaao just fine if i don’t think too much about it, and it’s enough that i love seeing other people love it.</div>

 <div class=reply>a couple months… wow. that’s such an unattainable amount of free time for me rn that my first thought is that i’d very likely do nothing. read, lounge around, watch a lot of movies and shows bc i’m really behind on those. but wow — that is So much time. i’ve finished chaptered fics in less time, i think. i can’t even fathom it. but honestly… mostly, i just want a proper break. and not a vacation with friends or family or really anyone, but a break living in the countryside of a country where i don’t speak the language and i won’t get hate-crimed for walking around not understanding a thing, you know? i really won’t bother anyone. i won’t be a tourist about any of it. i hate being a tourist anywhere. i’ll just live in an airbnb for a couple months, go do normal people’s version of nothing, barely going out, reading and cooking and going out for groceries at a place within walking distance. i won’t hang out or go out with a single soul. i’ll just be a part-time spectre drifting through the streets of a small town, form my own routine, learn enough of the language through immersion and by the end of my stay at least be able to chat and say thank you to the grocery store people and say good morning or good evening to locals lilting about, if that’s the practice in that town. if not, that’s also fine. but i’m being digressive as usual oops my answer is that if i had a couple months break to do whatever, i’d just want to be nobody for a bit. no life, no self, no one to know me or try to reach me. that sounds unbelievably good right now. it doesn’t have to be anywhere special. i just want to emotionally and mentally hibernate.</div>

 <div class=reply>not that i think this is a point of shame at all but to be honest with you yes i did but yes i did for the superficial reason that i heard machida keita was in it 😔 obv he wasn’t there for very long but edits led me to believe he’d show up for a lot more scenes than he did, but by the time i realized that, i’d already watched a third of the series and decided to finish it bc i also really liked yamazaki kento and tsuchiya tao’s chemistry in that asadora they starred in. <br><br>alice in borderland didn’t really leave much of an impression on me, in either a good or bad way. it didn’t linger in my mind after watching, and def not enough to read the manga (?) but i’m also not against watching the new season if someone offers it up. and of all the recent survival type dramas, it’s for sure the one i feel the warmest to! <br><br>sorry i'm just now realizing you didn't ask me for what i thought, just whether i watched it, to which the answer is just. yes. i did.</div>

 <div class=reply>PLEASE IT’S DEF NOT INACCURATE !! it changes bc i’m not often at my desk when i’m writing, but when i Am at a desk i usually have a bag of veggie chips or a pile of yogurt granola bars/chocolate bars to the side of my keyboard at the same time. the closest approximation i have is like… there’s a show on fb watch called skam austin, and in season two week eight, around the 13min mark, the main character is typing on her laptop in a dark room, and when we switch to the next scene, with the sun up and the room lit now, she’s still in the exact same position typing on her laptop. that’s what writing feels like for me, so i imagine i look like that too. kinda in a trance, def in a position that hurts my back, doing that for hours until i snap out of it. these days, i’m mostly lying on the floor and writing on my phone, or at least the last two fics i’ve written have been from a phone kind of writing. but once upon a time, before she became a lo-fi icon, i def related to shizuku down to how she sits at her desk.</div>

 <div class=reply>YES. THAT’S THE ONE. I DON’T REMEMBER WHAT I SAID IN THAT CC REPLY BUT I’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE SHORT STORY FOR AGES. THAT’S EXACTLY IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. all i had in my head nowadays was that the author was someone with a popular booktok novel, but that didn’t really narrow things down for me in the end 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s going alright whoa tysm for asking !! i haven’t had anyone horrible so far, thankfully, and i’ve really enjoyed making coffee with a proper machine (and getting free drinks and gelato.) i’m just very — unused? to this much social interaction one after the other? i was prepared for the usual barista small talk, but a lot of the customers stick around to chat while i’m working and sometimes the topics they want to discuss get personal or more in-depth than i expect, and i’ve found that it’s quite draining for my social battery though ofc i want to treat each convo with as much respect and thought as possible. but also i just don’t have a lot of social stamina, more of a calm one on one guy, so it makes sense why this would exhaust me a lot more than any job or project has. i’m sure i’ll get used to it! it’s barely been more than a week !! so !! but seriously, thanks for thinking of me and checking in and i also hope you’re doing well 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>hello !!!! i love how anecdotal this cc is haha ty for dropping by and thinking of me. i'm sending warmth right back to you 🤍🌷<br><br>also dw i still keep track of jjk stuff here and there !! it’s not taboo to bring it up with me or anything, i promise. i still honour? acknowledge? the time i spent with it and the content i created for it. it just wasn’t my scene even back then, and it isn’t now, so please don’t walk on eggshells on my account, it really is totally fine. but i really appreciate the consideration.<br><br>i… have not watched jjk 0. not bc i didn’t want to (i still do! i literally check every day for any kind of streaming and at this point i might as well watch the cam version) but bc i was… just that broke at the time that it was airing where i am? really no other way to word that i’m sorry and i swear that's not some ill-placed pity grab it !! i just didn’t have disposable income bc i was between production seasons, i indulged a little too much than was financially wise for gifts during the holidays, etc. a friend living all the way in tokyo literally offered to send me money for a movie ticket at some point, and it's funny to laugh about now bc i was literally living off yogurt too. but anyway. i have all the money to spend now but the movie isn’t really easily available to me anymore, so — kinda lost my chance there, unfortunately :( but if ever the opportunity to do so comes up, i’m definitely jumping on it. seeing animated jjk makes me yearn for that period of watching it weekly while the anime was airing, so i really would love to see more mappa content, whenever that might be.</div>

 <div class=reply>only the 2001 anime! it made… a very gentle impression on me? i was much younger and my perception on what sort of media resonated with me then is ofc very different from what that perception is now, but while i didn’t really connect with fruits basket myself, i understood what people took away from it and why they love it with such an intimate level of… almost innocent adoration? idk. there’s a lot of fierce but pure love for fruits basket out there that’s very much deserved, but it’s just not a series i connected with back in the day, or at least not enough to be particularly eager to get to watching the reboot. but i’ve heard really good things about it, and i’m glad it’s one of those animes trapped in the nostalgia of the 2000s deluge but got a faithful, loving adaptation with a better team on hand after some time has passed. if i had to pick anything from that era myself, fruits basket would def have been in my shortlist. even i can see it’s a personal work to a lot of people — so. hats off to that. i think it’s needed now more than ever, this kind of storytelling.</div>

 <div class=reply>ohhh whoa okay hm my own first koreeda film was our little sister, and while i don’t think it’s a bad one to start on, i’d probably go with shoplifters first. it’s his most recent + more widely available japanese film, and one of his most critically praised. more than that though i’d say it captures the ethos of his work at its most compact so far: it has that koreeda sincerity in a more grounded narrative than might first appear obvious in his earlier films. that, and i like to start with the later work of any creator and work my way back if i must. it’s really nice to see what someone creates when they’re a little older and a lot wiser and to get to compare that to their earlier stories as a viewer/reader.<br><br>so — i’d say shoplifters first, then our little sister. maybe like father, like son, if you want to work your way backwards chronologically from our little sister, but my own personal koreeda favourites are after life and still walking. i’m not really familiar with his non-japanese filmography at the moment, but within that, nobody knows and hana both also deserve a nod for what he was palpably trying to do within the structure of those stories. <br><br>ty for this q and i wish you a nice day/night as well 💗</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha !! i was wondering, when you write longfic of around 50k or more words, how do you decide if it becomes chaptered or stays as one big old chunk of story as a oneshot? :0 does the word count factor into it, or is it more of a choice affected by plot or the time your stories are set in?</div>

 <div class=reply>hello !! tysm for this q !! and i know i know i Know this isn’t a sufficient nor helpful answer and i’m really sorry, but… i go by vibe? every chaptered fic i have, believe it or not, started with the intention of being a oneshot :( i kinda just go with feeling it out and writing until it feels like i’ve reached a point for the story to pause/breathe if not end, and sometimes that takes me right to the finish line, like in skow and igyssr, which are both above 10k but are still contained enough in one “chapter.” most times if i end a section, or i accomplish what felt right to me in that part of the story, and i find that there’s a lot more to the story than i thought there would be, i let that chapter stay as is and split the story into chunks. but most of the time the initial chapter count is just based on me feeling out a general shape of the story in my head. the wc has nothing to do with it. i’ve written chapters under 2k, and i’ve written some above 30k. it’s more like… what the chapter is doing within the context of a story. sometimes that’s informed by time, like in ltmmly, where it was essentially one or two chapters per a week’s worth of their dating arrangement. but in flls, i had to keep the alternating povs in mind, and had to make sure i gave both yuuji &amp; megumi equal amounts of space — and when i felt like i didn’t, i wrote the coda, which was all megumi’s, except alternating between past and present within the same oneshot to cover the space between ch 6 and 7 in the original story. in my most recent au, i had five diff povs to work with, and time and space was essentially a non-factor for plot reasons, so each chapter division was more about how much of each pov character i was exploring at a time. one of the pov characters gets a whole chapter to himself, others don’t get a pov if they wrote an article or lyrics or whatever else it might be in the same chapter. it’s a matter of — did i cover all that i could have in this chapter? will it feel right if i include this or that thing here? if i haven’t covered it all yet, i keep going within that same chapter until i can say yes. if i have, i end that chapter and start a new one, and so on and so forth until the story itself feels complete, even if i have to add or remove chapters. i have very little self discipline in that sense, which is how you end up with 100k+ wc in my fics. i really do need to work on improving that abandoned way of writing and streamline it better somehow.</div>

 <div class=reply>this is not a recipe at all but i don’t even eat meals anymore these days i just eat brioche toasted with pomegranate-cherry-strawberry jam + brie and somehow i am yet to tire of it. i’m so swamped i don’t even cook except to air fry some fully cooked proteins, but when i do want rice i just quickly make garlic fried rice (is that what sinangag is? that’s what you call it in tagalog at least) and fry some scrambled eggs. the key here is using leftover rice kept in the fridge from the day before, bc then it toasts so much better and gets crispy when fried, which is how i like my egg-paired fried rice. add a little oil, garlic, salt and pepper to the rice, sometimes some soy sauce but i prefer it without tbh, and that’s it. the eggs we have are from a friend of a friend’s farm and idk what’s diff about them but they get really creamy beaten and fluffy cooked, which make for amazing omelettes and scrambled eggs. i like my eggs a bit on the saltier side, bc then it goes really well with sweet banana ketchup. <br><br>okay the latter half of this is just me talking about how i like my food i’m sorry it’s not a proper recipe but i’m afraid i’m not much of a cook nowadays… or at all, really. i’m just resourceful with leftovers.</div>

 <div class=reply>HELP the catch here is i think my playlists are all on the same baseline level? if one’s embarrassing then the others def are too … some of the titles on my private playlists are barbie diaries (it’s like… Y2K rock? idk how to describe it. beabadoobee and jeon somi are both on it), faustian contract (classical + some ost pieces for when i need to act like a possessed composer or conductor) and white square (white people music… like bazzi… and boy in space…) <br><br>OH NO WAIT HOLD ON LMAO I TAKE ALL THAT BACK I HAVE ONE CALLED “HI GOD IT’S ME” AND IT’S LITERALLY JUST. MY FAV CHURCH SONGS. I’M NOT A PRACTICING CATHOLIC ANYMORE BC [WAVES HAND AT THE TRAUMA CATHOLICISM GAVE ME] BUT SOME OF THE SONGS FROM THE GOOD OL’ DAYS HIT TOO HARD FOR ME TO LET GO OF. I MISS RITUAL MORE THAN I MISS RELIGION, OR HOWEVER THAT QUOTE GOES. SO THEY GET A PLAYLIST. it’s got bangers such as “sing a new song” (an unparalleled entrance song) “here i am, lord” (just a good ballad, period), “hail holy queen” (the sister act arrangement ofc) and “lord, i lift your name on high” (from the praise baby collection bc… idk. it scratches the inside of my brain when the junior choir starts singing too) <br><br>yeah, i think that’s gotta be the most embarrassing one. everything else is just… whatever, you know? my walking playlist has both hyperpop and kpop. a vibe is a vibe. same goes for gospel songs, apparently 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>i am… not able to share them, unfortunately, bc it would mean sharing my real life by posting links to the articles (which aren’t up yet, to be also fair) but if you meant whether i can share what they were about, then hell yeah, i’d love to talk about them !! <br><br>the first one was on the concept of soft cities, which is basically this architectural approach? philosophy? centred around people-first urban planning. the idea is that we can make cities more people-friendly by making them walkable and sustainable, thereby allowing for more human-friendly space “between buildings” — that is, we get more time being outside rather than being ping-pong’d between a residential building for domestic life and a corporate office for work life, for example. by making cities more walkable and sustainable, we’ll eliminate the need for cars, which would eliminate a great deal of city pollution and construction and people-unfriendly roads. BUT then the pandemic happened, and essentially my article was on whether soft cities are still possible in this post-covid era. now that we’ve gone ahead ourselves and made hundred-story office buildings reevaluate their own necessity, for example, what will now happen to urban planning as we once knew it? in a world of remote work and instinctive social distancing, what will now happen to urban planning as we once knew it? can the soft city philosophy still apply with these new architectural norms we’re building for ourselves?<br><br>and the second piece was on the “i do not dream of labour” trend, but specifically examining whether it’s the beginning of a shift in the labour world, like online culture acts like it is, or if it’s tone-deaf trend that’s only available to people who have the financial means to choose their lifestyle in the first place. plus what does it mean to not dream of labour, and why is it that we don’t dream of labour? is it labour we mean, or do we really just mean being a cog in the capitalistic machine? is it bc we associate labour with lack of self-fulfilment? why do we? bc so many of us go to school for things that didn’t end up fulfilling us?<br><br>but anyway. these were so fun to write and they’re very close to my heart, as most articles end up being by the time i’m done, so tysm for being interested :)</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhhh i don’t know if i’d have advice necessarily, bc even the people most ~representative of their types still have their own individual slew of life experiences and problems too specific for me to have, like, universal advice for. but a little appreciation in the form of things about each type i respect, i can def do:<br><br>let’s see… i admire 1s for their instinctive capacity for organization, whether internally or externally, and i appreciate their ability not only to handle the small nitty-gritty details that i don’t have the emotional or mental storage space for but also to rearrange that into a form that’s more accessible and applicable. i appreciate type 2s for how thinking of other people comes so incredibly naturally to them, and i admire their ability to really, truly empathize from a place of personal emotion. i love the ambition and drive of type 3s, and i respect their limitless tenacity when it comes to carving out the life and world they want to achieve with their own hands. i salute how type 4s perfect the art of getting to know themselves, of mapping out their own interiority, and how they are able to prioritize their independent identity-making above all else. it’s a trait that’s hard to come by, even in a creative environment. i am infinitely bettered by the ways that fellow 5s love the world through the knowledge they collect and give back in the form of what they create in turn. i understand them, and even if we don’t know each other personally, i always feel understood by the work of fellow 5s each time i encounter one. there’s something intrinsic in that recognition. i respect how 6s entertain lines of questioning i never would have considered, and prompt me to have a clearer commitment to the beliefs and values that i stand by. i love 7s for their wit, their spontaneity, their open-hearted and open-minded iteration of clearheaded intelligence. no other type embodies real, human joy the way healthy 7s do in my eyes. i love 8s for their resilience and their ability to act without any meaningless actions attached; i’m indebted to their ability to inspire me and snap me awake when life starts losing its excitement for me. and i appreciate 9s for being able to unflinchingly stand their ground in the middle of it all, for finding neutral spaces to exist within even in a world marked by turbulence. <br><br>feeling very much like a mom blogger on ig but it is what it is 💫</div>

 <div class=question>hi! i hope you're doing well! i just wanted to say i love hearing your thoughts about books/shows/movies you get into, you always have a lot to say and you're very articulate! i have a question though, how did you train yourself to become such an engaged "consumer" (that doesn't feel like the right word but i can't think of any other words to describe it, unfortunately)? how can i engage more with the books i read, how can i better analyze them? do you have any advice?</div>

 <div class=reply>i do always have a lot to say huh haha but tysm for being so kind about my rambling thoughts 🤍honestly, though, that’s just all they are…? rambling thoughts. like, the reason i’m so wordy is probably bc i think as i go. i’m sure if you really wanted to, you can follow my exact thought process as you move through one of my rants, in a newsletter or in a tweet thread, whichever. so i’m not sure i did anything to “train” myself? i don’t even know if media engagement is something that can be taught, necessarily. i mean, i’m sure there are studies on media literacy and how to be a good critic of what you consume, but i’ve never thought about until this moment. my take is — and i know this is gonna sound pretentious — the only component you have to be aware of when consuming anything is that a human being has created that piece of media, right? it’s not like i watch a film or read a book or listen to a song already thinking Hm Alright Let’s Find A Deeper Meaning In This. no, that would totally sour the experience for me. plus if i go into smth with an existing lens like that, i lowkey already lost the right to interpret. so i sit there and i experience the thing. if i’m lucky, i fall into it. if i don’t, i stop consuming it. <br><br>what someone might consider “analysis” is the part that comes way after. when i’m sitting there like whoa that left me a warm feeling, or whoa that was crap. then you start interrogating the human feeling that a human being left in you with their work. why did it make you feel warm? bc you liked the relationships? what are the choices behind the portrayal of those relationships that you felt invested in? did it resonate with you? that sort of thing. you just keep moving smaller bc every big piece of art is a mosaic of the smaller details that a human hand chose. whether the motivation for those choices is literal government propaganda or simply bc the director wanted to get as close to real life as possible. even if you thought/felt nothing about a piece of media, there’s always a reason why that is. even the ones where you’re like “whatever.” something doesn’t have to be deep for it to have a meaning. there’s already meaning that led to you consuming this thing at all in the form that you are. <br><br>i’d say all this comes more naturally the more you do it, and esp if you’re any kind of creating individual yourself, you start noticing media/art choices more bc you yourself make your own choices in your work. there are only so many configurations possible when mixing plot + character + themes. the only job there is in “analysis” is figuring out why you ended up getting the configuration that you did, i think. <br><br>this prob makes no sense i’m talking nonsense but i hope there’s at least one valuable bit here to answer ur q !! this was so fun to reply to, and i hope you're also doing well as can be :)</div>

 <div class=reply>i said this in another cc, but please know that of course i can’t generalize based on a personality test that can’t possibly measure everything that someone is, etc. but also. 8w7s are my fav type. they’ve just tended to be my fav kind of people, whether by coincidence or as a direct consequence of the type. they’re at the top of my adoration tier list, no contest whatsoever. i find myself fond of gut centre types overall, but 8w7s especially are just… people i can’t help but love and admire. moving to the beat of their own drum, stubborn about their personal values but the 7 wing softens it so they’re flexible everywhere else, serious about both their passions and indulgences. self-sustaining. independent. interesting, bc even at their worst they always have their own thoughts to bring to the table, which is a quality i find myself more compatible with than someone who can’t articulate anything to me or someone who’s too subjective about who they are. i took this uquiz once that asked me for a quality i look for in a friend and i chose something along the lines of “they’re distinct, and allow you to be distinct as well” — and i think that’s emblematic of type 8s. 8s tend to know exactly what and who they are, and while they’re often unapologetic about it, which to some might come across as prickly or domineering or obnoxious or inconsiderate, i find a lot of comfort in how they operate. they bring a lot of joy and warmth and enthusiasm and excitement in my life just by being themselves. they’re who i think of when i think of people who are intelligent and competent. not the flawed attempts at competence that head centre types do. even when 8s are doing stupid things, they’re Doing. they’re Being. it’s such a wonderful dynamic to have with the external world, from my perspective.<br><br>at their best, 8s are unafraid and honest and they waste no emotion or thought. if the person underneath is a trustworthy person, or at least someone i can love, having a fully realized 8w7 relationship with the world is just kinda the final nail in the coffin. it doesn’t matter if their humour is a little dry or blunt, or if they don’t have much of a filter — i love it all. they’re also very ambitious individuals bc they’re so passionate about who and what they love and the life they want to live, and sometimes that clashes with my desire to live a quiet life, but it’s hardly a deal breaker. if anything, it encourages me to do better and reflect differently on what i’m doing and choosing and thinking. which is ideal for a 5 like me anyway. <br><br>bottomline is 8w7s are people i can really connect with and talk to. i have no shortage of love for them and how they live life. it’s so easy to be in love with who they are, is all. not with them, or even romantically, but just — it makes me love the world a little more, too, when 8s i love are also rampaging through it.</div>

 <div class=reply>RIGHT !!!!! i don’t think the ao3 tag even exists ?? it’s So wild to me. but ahhh i don’t know if i want to write for it at the moment, necessarily, but i always say that even for things i end up writing about. right now i don’t think there’s any canon material i need to articulate more on… it’s a fairly straightforward story backed with gorgeous art and wonderfully tense character dynamics + it’s very much in its early stages, and we’ve only recently started getting real backstory and conflict on guideau &amp; ashaf, let alone characters like johan &amp; phanora. there’s not much to work with in terms of writing a piece, i think. but i’ll happily indulge a need to write if ever i’m hit by it in the future! ✨</div>

 <div class=reply>like… in general? to someone who has never watched movies? to someone who likes horror but wants some romance? to someone who likes romcoms but wants to venture into horror? guilty pleasure movie recs? oscar winning ones? please don’t just gonna throw half a question at me and then leave me to fight for my life 😭<br><br>honestly though i can’t remember the last time i watched a movie on my own, in my own time. when i say i'm very normal about movies, i really do mean it. it isn't a category of media that gets a chokehold on me often. but uhhh i enjoyed what 花束みたいな恋をした / loved like a flower bouquet / we made a flower bouquet tried to do with its central relationship. saw the evangelion rebuild tetralogy; have a lot more thoughts than i'm willing to admit. my fav directors include hirokazu kore-eda, steven soderbergh, mike mills and agnès varda. my comfort movies are roman holiday and bringing up baby. the last movie to make me cry was honey boy. the last movie to kinda make me wish i hadn’t bothered watching it was power of the dog. a movie i should have watched before i unsubscribed from netflix was the lost daughter. i’m sorry i’m trying to wrack my head for a movie i’ll really, seriously rec to a total stranger, no other info on their likes and dislikes provided, and the only ones that come to mind are the before trilogy, which is like having a light but tasty three-course meal. if someone has never seen a movie, ever, big ones that deserve their fame are parasite, the handmaiden and pan’s labyrinth. i also saw everything, everywhere, all at once and people seemed to really love that one and i see why. if you make me list movies i have a very vivid memory of watching for the first time, i’d say: kramer vs kramer, 5cm per second, shiva baby, us and them, minding the gap and shirkers.</div>

 <div class=reply>i’ve read dorian gray, maybe a couple stray poems, def a journal entry or two in high school, but that’s about it. aestheticism isn’t a literary movement i appreciate very much in general, and of course that trickles down to the themes and worldviews they wrote about then, which imo oscar wilde is super emblematic of.</div>

 <div class=reply>tysm i hope you are as well !! i don’t know why i keep getting ccs about the goldfinch but if you don’t mind me linking them, here are a few ccs i answered about it: <br><br>https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1254385101<br>https://curiouscat.live/sleeptowns/post/1254429657<br>https://curiouscat.me/sleeptowns/post/1273495595<br><br>you also mentioned seeing my literal log, and i don’t know if you’ve already read it, but my review is right there too :)<br><br> https://literal.club/activity/d5044870-b2c2-11ec-8080-8000223ba3d8<br><br>but a lot of these are also just me talking about the books assuming you’ve read it, and since you haven’t, i really… don’t know… what i can tell you? the summaries are online, and i’m sure the blurb on the back of the book will do a better job talking about the plot of the novel than i ever can. otherwise, all i can give is a thumbs up! i don’t know what you like so i don’t feel comfortable making universal conclusions about you liking it, and i won’t pretend like the people who hate the goldfinch don’t exist or aren’t valid, but on my end, it’s prob in my top ten fav books of all time. so.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh interesting hm 6s are not my fav type, personally. and like — obviously, every individual is different and has more layers than any personality typology will capture, so to make a generalization like this isn’t fair on my part. i’m sure there are 6w5s i’ll love, just as there are 6w5s i won’t get along with for parts of who they are that have little to do with them being a 6w5. <br><br>that said, i’ve met a fair amount of 6w5s, and so far, they’ve just been a type i’ve found myself incompatible with? it’s strange bc it’s a fellow head type, but it’s how that way of thinking manifests that i just would rather… avoid. there’s a lot of their approach to life that i find either needless or excessive to the point of inefficient, no in between, and it’s a shame bc i think a lot of 6s ask necessary questions but don’t really know how to make it useful beyond that. there’s asking the right questions and constantly turning to more and more things to find answers and constantly editing and re-editing the inquiries they pose, but then there’s just creating more fuss than the situation calls for. it’s a very high maintenance kind of being head-oriented, and that in itself isn’t a bad thing, but if that perpetual hypervigilance and hyper-care ends up yielding basically nothing significant in the end, then to me, what’s the point, you know? there are people who find much value in being in that cycle of asking and vigilance and anxiety, and thumbs up to them — but it’s not the case for me. a friend once joked that 1s and 6s are the types most likely to use a notion template for every minute of a trip itinerary, and it’s accurate enough that for that part of their personality alone, we’re already more incompatible than i would be with, say, intuitive 4s or reckless 7s or instinctive 8s. <br><br>but the quality in 6w5s that tends to make me swerve hard is that… they never seem to have their own opinions? in a way vastly different from how 4s also rely on external sources. but the 6w5s i’ve encountered either too easily agree with others to a point where i’m like “oof why did i bother making this a discussion” or parrot / quote opinions that aren’t even theirs but seemed contrary enough for them to repost and agree with without any real interrogation or inquiry on their part. and that… really ticks me off. at best, it’s an empty argument. at worst, it’s thinking that their echo chamber opinions are fact. neither, i vibe with.<br><br>i know 6s have it very hard at the heart of the head centre. any wing they have is another head type, and that doesn’t leave much for them to go except to spiral inside their own heads. there are parts there that are valuable or make a good match with other types, but for me, personally, i have a hard time forming trustworthy, worthwhile, fulfilling friendships with them, and i’m sure they with me. it’s not a dynamic i often see going anywhere.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have !! when the second ch came out i tweeted on priv that yamaguchi sensei took a covid break and decided they needed a couple months to just indulge on attractive vampires and a slew of kinks on the side — which i gotta respect. kamiya isn’t meaty at all, but i don’t think it was necessarily meant to be? or that it had to be? <br><br>echoing oomf’s thought here that yamaguchi’s shorts tend to suffer from lack of space to be more despite potential, but i’d also say it’s their narrative approach as a whole that’s on the lighter side. their art *is* the storytelling, and they tend to excel more in what they don’t say bc their art is so expansive that you tend to get more from it than you can read off dialogue/written exposition anyway. it’s a strength in blue period bc there’s lots of room to get to know this world. if you zoom in, you’ll notice that the movement of yatora’s own development so far has been nothing but a circle, esp if you consider the thematic strength of storylines involving yuka, haruka, yotasuke, even kuwana — but a lot of that is bc yamaguchi has just been leisurely with what they include in each chapter, so yatora’s been moving at a repetitive cycle that you don’t really mind bc you don’t only have one chapter or so with him. even if you squint at what looks like a lack of concrete forward momentum in his character, the pacing at least allows the reader to project onto yatora’s more universal traits or to extrapolate who he could be. if nothing else, he’s very much real &amp; accessible through yamaguchi’s art, and we can excuse the present by knowing he’s come so far despite who he still is and that he has all the time in the world to grow. it’s the whole Point of yatora. he’s static and earnest and self-involved and incomplete, but blp’s story and world as it is benefits from being told for the most part through his perspective and his growing relationship with art.<br><br>but you see that same approach in kamiya and it doesn’t land bc it doesn’t have the space to fill itself out nor to give you enough to do it yourself. it was great to read bc it’s so richly visualized, &amp; it’s worth noting that in two chs it still had me feeling for sachi, but plot and worldbuilding wise, it didn’t have enough space to be… anything, really. which would be fine — idc about worldbuilding as long as the vibes are right — if the ending it got hadn’t hinged on a stable plot foundation. i love a good ambiguous/unexplained ending, but with kamiya, there was just nothing for the ending to feed off for impact, and that’s why i think it comes off as abrupt. i’m not mad at it! there are a few choices that i don’t agree with and would have wanted to see panning out differently, but i really enjoyed it overall! at the end of the day, i mostly just think it could have been more if it was given the space to, full stop.</div>

 <div class=question>uhhh i dont know what prompted this question, just that i've been sitting on it for a while, but do you know anybody who smokes? (do you smoke?) and if so, what do you do with knowing, do you just brush it off? condone or condemn? what if it was someone close to you? sorry if this question is a little touchy</div>

 <div class=reply>ahh idk if you meant a specific kind of smoking but the catch all answer is that i... know more people who smoke than people who don’t. i myself don’t smoke nicotine regularly but i won’t pass up a joint in social settings or to help me sleep. i have my own stash of rolls, etc. you get the gist. <br><br>that said, i live in a country that has all of these things legalized and readily available, so culturally and socially speaking, it’s normalized where i am. this isn’t to say that we’ve collectively decided these things aren’t harmful in the long run, but it’s also not exactly a world-ending concern beyond the individual level? there’s social etiquette stuff in place about not smoking cigarettes around public spaces like campuses and subway stations so that you don’t subject others to your secondhand smoke, but that’s really where my issues with other people smoking begin and end. what people do with their own time and their own bodies is no concern of mine, and i won’t want what i do with mine to be anyone else’s concern, either.<br><br>with smoking or really any kind of recreational drug use, i don’t think your two choices are automatically to condone or condemn. bc — condone what? condone their right to consume what they’d like? i would hope you do. or condemn them for — what? for using a substance that — does what exactly? messes up their body, sure, absolutely, and anyone’s right to be worried about that, but i also always wince about this internalized instinct to villify any kind of addiction and drug use as if it’s inherently tied to someone’s moral purity choices and not, you know, an addiction.<br><br>and i promise i say all this gently. it sounds as if we’re both coming at this from widely different cultural contexts, and it just happens that my position on someone wanting to casually smoke / vape / get high is that it’s none of my business. it’s not something for me to police, and certainly not something for me to paint someone as some kind of condemnable figure for doing. <br><br>i completely understand where you’re coming from about being worried when someone close to you starts smoking. it presents a lot of extreme health risks, not to mention it can be an expensive habit to sustain. but i hope that’s where your worries are focused around. i know there’s a lot of moral conservatism here that’s rooted via a lot of factors and i can’t unpack it all with one cc answer, but i guess my point is that it’s smoking that’s bad, not the smoker. and i’m not saying that just bc i also smoke sometimes. i am fully aware of the health risks i pose to myself with whatever i do. and as long as that person you know also is aware, then the only stance i have left to reiterate is that whatever someone does with their bodies, provided they don’t harm anyone by it or renders smth dysfunctional to a point that destroys their life and affects those around them, is none of my business.</div>

 <div class=question>hellow sha sorry if you've answered this before but while i was reading letter eight, (which was fantastic btw. you put into words something so hyperspecific and indescribable.) i read "watching your homeland fall prey to misplaced and weaponized nostalgia" and had to ask: are you from the philippines?

 <div class=reply>omg thank u so much for reading huckleberry !!! and no, you’re totally right to make the connection! i’ve been living in canada since i was a teenager, but otherwise i was born and raised in the philippines.<br><br>that said, i know people there tend to have conflicted feelings about the diaspora (very, very rightfully so), and i don’t pretend like i know half the things experienced by people my age over there when i at least have the privilege of watching from overseas untouched by it all for the most part. but i have spent more time growing up in the philippines than i have calling any other country home, so… there is still a lot of grief transferred across that identity, though i suppose there would still be that even if i wasn’t filipino at all. it’s just… this long, neverending sigh, seeing it all happen.</div>

 <div class=reply>not since i was much younger :( or at least too young to receive it with any articulate sentiments except “yikes this is loaded” and “oh cool haha culturally religious designs” or even a passing thought that “whoa this is a pretty cohesive portrayal of depression.” but honestly, everything is a loaded metaphor for depression when you’re a depressed teenager, bc “depression” is the only piece of vocabulary you have for all the emotional turbulence you’re experiencing. <br><br>if i were to watch it now, i’d probably consider those initial thoughts quite one-dimensional takeaways on my part? or at least just the beginning to better thoughts? i’ve hesitated a lot on rewatching it bc i wasn’t in the greatest headspace when i was consuming it for the first time and idk i have this completely irrational worry that revisiting things i watched when i was at my ~worst would bring me back there. but ahhh i see people talking about it and yearn to have things to offer, though! i really, really wanna rewatch it, especially with new nge stuff having come out recently. <br><br>a part of me wrinkles my nose at seeing overly earnest interpretations of nge bc a lot of them are articulated in a way that seems almost pretentious for what the source material actually is, but at the same time… i totally get it. especially considering where nge is positioned in the, like, anime canon, or whatever. nothing contemporary to it was really doing what nge was, so i understand how it’s survived to us as this iconic piece of media. <br><br>as i am right now, my only thoughts are that if nothing else, i think evangelion is especially… pertinent? to the current… idk. what’s a good word to use. the current social climate? the current state of the world? it’s especially pertient to this current generation, at least. when i first watched it, a lot of my thoughts about it were very personal, in the sense that the themes that reached me were about loneliness and the weight of personal responsibility in a world much bigger than your one individual life and all the baggage you carry, etc. all that stuff. it was very self-centric. not ego-centric or narcissistic, just literally centred on the weight of the self. but if i watch it now i’d probably also think something about how representative shinji and all the other kids are of a whole younger generation born into a world already on its dying breath, and how much inherited trauma and grief marks a life began and lived like that. it’s a little too relevant to today’s ~youth, is what i’m trying to say. it will be an interesting lens to approach it from if i were to rewatch it now. <br><br>we’ll see if i ever do watch it again 🥲</div>

 <div class=reply>i was just thinking the other day about how lonely i feel these days, too, and how alienating it is to find spring and summer so dejecting bc most other people love the sunshine and warmer weather. so please know this has eased my heart as much as it can be eased at the moment, to know that there’s someone out there who feels this way. thank you so much for thinking of me and leaving this message. i’m sorry to hear you’re experiencing a lot of loneliness as well, and i’m sending you all the small joys possible in life at the moment, even in what feels like too much absence.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh thank you so much :( and i feel you !! whenever i want a new look for my carrd and search for alternatives it’s always for stan accs, which doesn't tend to align with what i need. ahhh i unfortunately don’t have any tutorial recs as i usually do mine from scratch — but what’s worked really well for me is making use of the manual option on mobile view and utilizing multiple columns so it looks cleaner and/or more readable. fonts also make a big difference in readability, especially for people who have trouble reading, and i try to pair serif with sans serif whenever i can instead of using two of the same. gives that sense of cohesion, you know? there are also a few tumblr blogs that regularly post transparent pngs, if you’re unable to make them yourself for whatever reason, and deciding on which visuals to include tends to inform the ~theme of the carrd.<br><br>i’m sorry this isn’t really a lot of help, but i wish you all the best of luck with your carrd, and i have faith you’ll find something that works for you &lt;3</div>

 <div class=question>this is coming out of nowhere but u mentioned that u were gonna tune into Netflix’s heart stopper!!! And uhhh idk if it was just me, but I found it harder to appreciate heartstopper (TV) and heart stopper as a comic based solely on the fact that the latter actually had a person out there sitting and drawing the cute lil guys alone as an individual person, initially for their own leisure, compared to uhhhh Netflix and it’s ultimately subpar cinematography and dialogue. umm either way I’d love to hear ur thoughts on it</div>

 <div class=reply>i did end up tuning in !! and hmm i think adaptations can be very, very tricky bc we want it to stay faithful to the source material while at the same time not be wholly unfit for the medium of its adaptation. some books are not meant to be films, for example. <br><br>that said, i honestly didn’t find the comic super impressive to begin with. i thought it was simple and sweet and straightforward — which isn’t a bad thing at all! it just made for light but unattached reading for me. it wasn’t… memorable? i wasn’t keen to continue where i left off. i wasn’t dying to talk to someone about it. i’m still not. i don’t even think i’d have anything to say about it. if someone asks me if i’d recommend it, i probably… wouldn’t. not bc of anything it did wrong or bc i think it’s terrible and never should have been made — god, no, i think it’s really important that it exists for the people who need it — but bc it’s just… not a stellar work, for me. and that’s okay. i said in a prev cc that i’m not in the demographic for this story, and again, this isn’t to devalue the importance of having simple sweet stories for queer youth. but i’m saying all of this bc i think that for the most part that same simplicity and sweetness is the comic’s main strengths for people open to being moved by that, and heartstopper tv tried to capture that earnestly. i’m not sure what you mean by the difference between knowing one person is doing it vs netflix, but regarding that, i’m just glad the role went to an actor who shares an identity with charlie more so than the author of the comic did. that’s what stories like that are meant to do, i feel, and i’m glad that the tv show gave breakout opportunities to people like joe locke and yasmin finney and will gao, etc.<br><br>the comic felt young and formulaic and straightforward, no amazing feats of storytelling or character work or anything like that, and so did the tv show. i think that’s absolutely fine. the comic doesn’t have it; the tv show didn’t Need it. as for technical stuff, the cinematography had the right idea at a few points, and there was clearly a lot of care to do things right in most parts of the production. i’m not saying the story didn’t deserve more, but my point is — heartstopper the comic didn’t serve me some life-altering coming-of-age story i’ll be thinking about forever. i wasn’t expecting the tv show to, either. what i did expect was for it to bring nick and charlie and everyone else to life for people who need to see them onscreen, and on that front, i think the tv show did a fine enough job. ofc it would be different for people who have a different attachment to the comic, but as for my own thoughts, i’m a-okay with what the tv show tried to do.</div>

 <div class=question>hellooo sha !! hope you're doing well ^-^ kind of a big question, but how did you start sharing your writing with friends? in my case, i can't see myself ever sharing my writing with anyone bc of how scared i am :// i'm really scared of their opinions on it because i truly do write from the floor of my heart and can't stand the thought of it not hitting right for anyone, which i know is a bit ridiculous and honestly bad for my development. i guess it's just the vulnerability of it all. i don't think i've shown my writing to literally anyone, at least not in the last few years, and i'm feeling a bit stupid about it. i've really wanted to get over this and share with my friends because i love them sm and i dont feel good hiding this part of me anymore. so i was wondering if you ever felt the same way when you started out? or if not if you have any tips at all to get comfortable with the idea of sharing? <br><br>also unrelated but does your last video contain spoilers for bp? im not caught up yet but i wanna watch !! :o &lt;333</div>

 <div class=reply>oh man i’ll be honest with you, i don’t really share my writing with my friends? ofc i have writer friends with whom i share excerpts, online and off, and i met a few of my current irl friends while we were writing for the same publication, but the general understood rule among the people around me is that i do some writing across various jobs and online spaces — and that’s really it. i don’t show them my writing. i don’t repost anything when my stuff comes out on social media. i don’t have a beta looking over my fics, before or during or after. i just — like to keep writing solitary, i guess. i’m too impulsive and messy a writer to really make it more than a one-person affair. plus whether or not my friends read my writing, whether or not they Like my writing, i’ll still continue to write for as long as i breathe, is how i think of it. everyone’s free to read whatever they want of my work, but it’s always more of a shock to me than a given when i find out a friend or even a mutual has read one of my fics or my newsletters or whichever else. <br><br>that isn’t to say i don’t understand your fears, though! i don’t think it’s ridiculous to be wary about how someone will respond to your writing, which in essence is a representation of your vulnerability, and even more so when that someone is a close friend you trust with your emotions and thoughts. so i don’t think you should feel stupid about that at all. it’s perfectly natural to feel protective about your own words, bc by extension you’re being protective about your own feelings and the labour it took you to connect those two to each other. that said, i think it counts for something how lovingly you speak of your friends, and i’m sure you can trust them with your fears. if starting with friends, plural, is too daunting, maybe start with one on one sharing, maybe someone with a gentler disposition or who’s more inclined to know what to say about your work. some friends mean well but won’t know how to talk about writing, for example. so if you have someone who knows how to be careful with your words, i’d say test the waters with them first. that way you don’t jump right into the deep end. it doesn’t have to be terrifying, i promise. and don’t be afraid to disclose how this is your first time sharing your writing! there’s no shame in being afraid! and no shame in being honest about fear! i’m sure if you ask them to be kinder with your heart, then they’ll be happy to do so. <br><br>ahhh i’m sorry i can’t be more helpful but i do hope you find your way to sharing. i can imagine it will feel very rewarding to take that first step. <br><br>and yes unfortunately the blp video does have some spoilers! but thank you so much nonetheless for wanting to watch !!</div>

 <div class=reply>wait tysm for paying attention to new additions to the playlist ?? but omg i’m really loving the releases from this new beabadoobee album and i can see what you mean so clearly ahhh it definitely has that vibe (and what an honour this is for me too) !! the last instrumental part is just so applicable to so many later parts in flls: the montage of memories as they’re breaking up, the moment they see each other again two years later, even the moment they see each other before the wedding for the first time after their fight and know what has to happen. missing those boys and that story very much in moments like this, so thank you for dropping by 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhh i don’t really use anything? i tried using notion once as a universal log for all the media i consume bc i get So fed up about sites like goodreads and letterboxd and the culture around users who rigorously maintain accounts on those, but i ended up being so annoyed with notion too that i managed to log barely half a month before abandoning it. but i know i just happen to be on the lazy, no-fuss side and that logging is compatible with a lot of other people, so i’d say look into notion if you haven’t. i’m sure you can look into templates that other people have made for logging books and movies and poems and even youtube videos. there are also a bunch of tutorials around.<br><br>and i do at least log novels, animanga, and some articles! i tried goodreads and storygraph and osu and readerly for logging novels, but the one that’s worked the best for me is literal club. it’s pretty as well as compatible with both casual and long rambling reviews. i like it a lot, and having a log i enjoy keeps me accountable to my reading habits, which i imagine is the goal with sites like this. for anime &amp; manga, i used to have a myanimelist, but since my account was from, like, 2009 and was abandoned for a few years, i recently moved to anilist. i much prefer its interface. then there’s instapaper, which i mostly use to save articles instead of having multiple tabs on browsers; unless i really like a piece, i delete it off the app after i read it — but if you’re looking for a place to save articles, period, it can work really well. <br><br>tl;dr: i totally feel you on the “casually” part, and on that front, i can vouch for literal club for logging novels, anilist for logging anime &amp; manga, and instapaper for logging articles.</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh like what kind of devotion? to a lover? to craft? to birds? to a colour? so many things we can be devoted to and i’d argue the very act of writing itself is a form of devotion so i’m not too sure how to streamline what to give you i fear<br><br>but uhhh i had a phase in hs where i just picked up every patti smith book there was bc everyone around me was reading just kids, but the first essay-type thing to come to mind at your cc was her memoir devotion (why i write). then my mind went to anne sexton and e.e. cummings, both of whom are pretty classic ~mainstream poets whose entire body of poetry for me all circle back in some way to a sense of devotion. more contemporary to us, i also love the collection postcolonial love poem by natalie diaz, which deservedly won the pulitzer not too long ago. <br><br>sorry i can’t be more specific, but if there’s anything in particular you’re looking for and you want to expand on what you mean by focusing on devotion, please do feel free to drop another cc and i’ll do my best!</div>

 <div class=reply>hunted down a similar q from february and i still stand by these three pieces (https://curiouscat.me/sleeptowns/post/1262607279), but some recent reads i liked enough to save on my instapaper are —<br><br>“the singularity is here,” ayad akhtar <br>https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/12/ai-ad-technology-singularity/620521/<br><br>“notes on work,” weike wang<br>https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/notes-on-work<br><br>plus an article i’ve had open on my phone for a couple days now on the literary horror genre: https://thewalrus.ca/new-horror-books/<br><br>also, my guilty pleasure in nonfiction are celebrity profiles — as in i’d read whatever about whoever, whether or not i actually even watch or read or listen to their oeuvre — and the one i read just last night on beadadoobee catered to all the reasons why: https://theface.com/music/beabadoobee-interview-beatopia-new-album-jacob-bugden-fake-it-flowers-matty-healy-dirty-hit-mental-health-psychedelics</div>

 <div class=reply>man this is gonna sound like the marc jacobs by marc jacobs for marc jacobs meme honestly but i’m an audio editor / producer / scriptwriter / music guy / occasionally someone’s co-host if they need it !! not bc i’ve been necessarily good at all of them enough to pursue it as a career so much as it was one of those fake it ‘till you make it things that i fell into mostly by accident after i graduated uni mid-pandemic, and now i both like it too much + have too much accumulated experience in it to really refuse projects when they come. <br><br>i just say audio producer on my cv, but essentially i work on literary podcasts and audiobooks. that’s really all it is. they give me a pool of stories / poems / sometimes plays and even visual art to pick from for a given production season, and i make something read into something heard. it’s a little like translating or adapting something? reading words off a page is one thing, but to turn a book into a movie is a more specific process, and turning written stories into an audio experience is like that, except without the visuals. the closest example i can give you without naming my own projects is, like, audible’s adaptation of neil gaiman’s comic series the sandman. but also mostly just the modern love podcast. that sort of thing. really, i just do the projects that come my way if i feel attached to them. and i like it a lot. it’s a different relationship with storytelling than i’ve ever experienced thus far.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, thank you so much – and yes, i do! kinda! i used to do creative nonfiction/journalism for around four to five years while i was in school but since i graduated uni i’ve been working in audio storytelling, both producing and writing-wise. <br><br>and hmmm that’s an incredibly broad question bc i don’t know what kind of writing you mean, or where you’re even coming from, what your background is, what your experience and goals are like, etc. but while i know this is a rather cliched response, sometimes the truth really is that you just have to go for it. like, don’t wait to get an official “job” (i.e. being a staff writer, a writing fellow, whatever it might be) to start pitching stories, submitting your fiction or your poems, writing your own things at your own time. there are always publications looking. i think a lot of people wait to get assigned things, or they apply to job openings being like “i’m a good writer, i swear. just trust me.” without anything in their cv to show for it, and although that isn’t at all to discredit someone’s talent, it is still true that you kinda have to have written published things to gain any sort of capital/momentum in the writing world, as with any industry but especially in creative ones. i see a lot of people let their writing go rusty bc they’re waiting for the “right” moment or opportunity, about which i always think that if you have to wait for your writing to come, it’s just as statistically possible that it never will, with what we define as the “right” moment. your writing is a lot more malleable to your habits and needs than you think, and the same way with whatever writing career there is to pursue for anyone. <br><br>other than that, i’d say just be receptive about feedback and flexible about the writing you want to do (venturing into unfamiliar genres, for example, has helped my writing more than it has harmed it, i wanna say) but grounded everywhere else. writing is an ever evolving thing, and that’s the most uncertain thing about it but also the most rewarding. there are always new avenues to explore, and always new kinds of writers to become.</div>

 <div class=question>thoughts on romantic yatora pairings other than yatora &amp; murai?</div>

 <div class=reply>i think there’s something significant to appreciate in each one! if we’re talking strictly romantic, though, <br>the only exception for me is yatora &amp; yotasuke, mostly bc my understanding of the characters and their dynamic just doesn’t lend itself very well to healthy romantic anything, no matter which angle i look at it from. i have a hard time reading and writing them as i understand them and framing it romantically — plus there’s also that maybe i’m just not a huge fan of how some corners of fandom… view… yotasuke? but none of this is to say i don’t love yatora &amp; yotasuke’s canon dynamic, full stop! i do very much! there’s a lot in these two i have loved exploring in an au, and even more i have loved just contemplating myself. i’m not trying to discount whatever people see in them. it’s just not for me, but in that, it’s a “just mute it and move on” easily solved type of situation.<br><br>otherwise, i find yatora &amp; yuka super neat! lots of tension and push &amp; pull there, and i’ve channelled a lot of my love for their complicated but dedicated dynamic into their idol au selves. not trying to have favorites in such a massive universe, but they’re Up There. and i can get behind yatora &amp; haruka the same way i can get behind yatora &amp; most anyone else. it’s fun. it’s simple. it’s cute. yatora’s one of those characters i want to be extra careful with, not bc he’s breakable and easily mischaracterized but bc his underlying worldviews and motivations feel in themselves like something fragile by way of precious. like a ceramic plate you’re molding alongside him. which you really are. and it just so happens that with murai, i have the luxury of a character much more settled and self-actualized than most we’ve met. that’s really all, honestly. i l*ve him as him, but i also just trust him to love yatora, you know? but that’s just my preference at the end of the day, and my preferences absolutely do not discredit the many wonderfully complicated dynamics yatora has, from mori to his high school friends to even fuji in the current arc.</div>

 <div class=reply>ohhh interesting !!!! see usually i consume a thing and i’m like well ok cool and know for sure i’ll probably never want to write for it, but blue lock has always been one of those series where it’s definitely never say never. if the temptation or urge or even just the opportunity comes, i do think i have at least one small blue lock fic in me? that temptation or opportunity isn’t here right now, and i don’t even know what i’d want to write, but again. never say never. i won’t say no to a chance.</div>

 <div class=question>Sha, every time I listen to Mitski, I think about you, as you were a huge influence for me to like her music. I’m seeing her live in November and I can’t wait!! I’m sure I’ll think about you when she sings FL/LS or Two slow dancers. So thanks for writing beautifully and inspiring other people.

 <div class=reply>ooooh really really good question !! i’ve thought about it once or twice? sometimes out of frustration for some of the questionable choices the story has made, and more recently bc tuning into the anime adaptation renewed so much of my early adoration for the characters — so i wouldn’t say it’s out of the realm of possibility altogether, definitely. there's certainly a lot of room i’d love to work with for junpei especially. right now, i think that if ever the urge comes up and i find myself drawn towards articulating certain things in whatever form, i’ll def be down for it.</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m a salinger enthusiast at heart, actually! though less so for catcher in the rye than the glass family stories, maybe? citr is one of those things that i resent the world for misrepresenting to the point that it’s become emblematic of a demographic i don’t think is completely fair to attach to it at all (male manipulator, red flag books, whatever, etc), but unlike how i feel about other classics that have gotten the same treatment, i’m just all around ambivalent to citr, i think. i read it. wasn’t wowed by it. but i felt enough that i do feel in some part protective towards it when i see it associated with a reputation i don’t really feel like it’s done anything to deserve. idk. it’s been a while. <br><br>but franny &amp; zooey was one of my fav books for a time! my memory of it is hazy bc i read it in a period i don’t remember very well at all anymore, but it must have meant something special to me if i even recall liking it. i’m not sure if it still would be a fav if i read it now, but i had a phase in my teenage years where salinger’s approach to writing his youth was The Goal for me. and i mean, to a degree, he’s still a big influence in what my style has become, and while i think i’ve outgrown his sparseness and his more jaded take on coming of age and slice of life, i still have a lot of respect for the things he made me pay attention to. like, how well his introspection characterized the kids he was writing from the perspectives of, or his ear for in-depth but organic-sounding dialogue, and especially how closely he identified with his characters in all of this. there’s a lot of love there, you know? he really saw his characters as People people, and not just people in service of a story, which is harder to come by in narratives than i realized back then. <br><br>all in all, i think my feelings about salinger just didn’t age well, not bc it soured or anything but bc it just didn’t age with me, and maybe that’s a good thing. his writing approach meant a lot to me when i was still figuring out what i liked and what felt right in reading and writing, and he was very accessible when i still wasn’t super comfortable exploring my writing in english. in many ways, i’m indebted to his work as a foundational stepping stone.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh wow thank you for asking !! i have been… not great, but okay. my mood tends to take a dip once it starts getting sunnier and warmer, strangely, so i’ve just been melancholic by disposition even if not melancholic by, like, emotion. but it’s okay! i’m chilling! getting work done for my adult job! working on some other stuff here and there! finally figured out what i can do with this super bitter culinary grade matcha that i was gifted in bulk! had my first toothache the other day since i was in high school, put my life on pause for a moment bc it’s always the most ridiculous sources of pain that give me an uppercut and not the multiple times i’ve fallen down stairs and ended up without a scratch. but now we’re thankfully back at it !!</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh i do all three! my attention span is a finicky little brat, and sometimes if i read too much in succession from physical copies and find myself drifting, i’d switch to reading on my ereader to get my focus back. otherwise, buying books and borrowing is entirely dependent on the price of the books/whether they’re even available from the library. i’m quite impatient with my anticipated releases and usually get them as soon as they’re out, hardcover and ridiculous prices and all. but most often, i buy books secondhand. i’m very lucky that there are a lot of great places where i live with wonderful selections of marked down books, if the price i gotta pay is that our library system isn’t the most up to date :(<br><br>i wish you a good day as well 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>this sent me on a frenzy until i realized there could only be one right answer at the moment and it’s “[i hope when it happens]” by diane seuss. i like when words have a rhythm that goes on and on and on and on until it’s either out of breath or sated, whichever comes first, but also i just like when i read smth and i think, “oh, we get each other.” even if for all i know, we’re not getting the same thing at all 😅<br><br>but anyway, i love the beginning of it:<br><br>I hope when it happens I have time to say oh so this is how it is happening<br>unlike Frank hit by a jeep on Fire Island but not like dad who knew too<br>long six goddamn years in a young man’s life so long it made a sweet guy sarcastic<br>I want enough time to say oh so this is how I’ll go and smirk at that last rhyme<br>I rhymed at times because I wanted to make something pretty especially for Mikel<br>who liked pretty things soft and small things who cried into a white towel when I hurt<br>myself when it happens I don’t want to be afraid I want to be curious was Mikel curious<br><br>and also also also nearly every poem from prelude to bruise by saeed jones but especially “room without a ghost,” for the same sentiments i loved about the poem above:<br><br>Sheer, breeze-caught curtains aren’t full-bodied,<br>just billowing. The wind isn’t trying<br>to touch you. Papers rustled, then scattered around the room<br>mean nothing. Do not read them<br>in the wind’s order. Do not fall to your knees,<br>deciphering the air and its invisible ink, or look up wide-eyed,<br>expecting. No one is standing there,<br>backed against the haze.<br>Not him. Not him.<br>No one is watching you but you.</div>

 <div class=reply>i mean — i did my time with it. i won’t pretend i didn’t. somewhere out there, the fics i wrote from 15 to 16 years old for idols are probably still up, and they’re no small things in themselves. right now, a lot older, i’d say i’m a lot more detached from all that. i don’t currently feel any inclination towards shipping real people, i steer clear of rpf wherever i can, and i’m hyper-careful to a fault about feeling attached to the celebrities i like. but at the same time, i think it’s inevitable for people to feel like getting into shipping real life people, whether it’s two actors that played lovers in a movie or idols in the same group or even two random idols mc-ing together, and i don’t see a point in being morally prescriptive or feeling morally superior just bc you’re heavily against the practice. it’s a moot point, to me, when shipping is almost this different angle on parasocial closeness with celebrity relationships. to oversimplify a little, it’s the same tendency to project or to over-fixate on personal details that shouldn’t be our business, when we're really just making a narrative off someone's life. <br><br>what i do find some discomfort about is when people go beyond the norms or confines of fandom and start forcing that not just onto but into the actual lives of those real people. if people want to watch an interview between two idols and read into it with a shipping lens, then yeah, obviously that will happen. but to start sending rated fics to idols, for instance, or making them uncomfortable directly in fansigns or through tweets, then i don’t think that’s very fair. lines get blurred in the celebrity realm, sure, and the reality is that people will always think commodification equals the right to objectification, but in that, i also feel like we have to understand that even the most “real” celebrities are still selling that real-ness as a product, and that product, both in the providing and the consuming end, shouldn’t be conflated with their private lives. if that makes sense.</div>

 <div class=question>oh i just saw your reply to someone else about the goldfinch being one of your favorite books (i hope this isn’t weird) and !! it’s been my all-time favorite piece of writing for the past few years since i’ve read it—I unexpectedly enjoyed it much more than i enjoyed tsh, which is super surprising to me bc i love love loved tsh! i think the way donna tartt treats her characters in the goldfinch (especially theo, who i think she handles much more kindly than she does richard though this is 100% attributable to the completely different premises of the story) so delicately and tenderly is so very simultaneously pleasing and heart-wrenching to read, because, it’s like, how can you simultaneously show your own want for your character to be happy while letting them suffer so much (as through theo)?? it’s clear that she loves her characters very much so it’s really cool to me that it comes through in her writing!! and especially through boris and all of his earnestness. i think i read a cc from you many many months ago about boris (although it may have been from someone else and i’m misattributing 😭)! <br><br>i would love to hear ur thoughts on the book / its characters btw!!! i realize now that this is a very rambly cc—sorry T_T)<br><br><br>also!! have you read the little friend by tartt—i’m thinking of picking it up again since i wasn’t able to finish it the first time through—and if yes, did you enjoy it??<br><br> (p. s. do you have any recs for novels similar to the goldfinch—not necessarily restricted to in the plot-sense but also in the writing style or similarities in character dynamics?) <br><br>i hope you are having a good day, wherever you are!!</div>

 <div class=reply>no no not weird at all omg it feels like every few months we circle back to the goldfinch in a cc somewhere, so if it’s alright with you, i’m going to link two ccs i answered on it + boris (which i think was the one you read) plus my literal club review:<br><br>➀ https://curiouscat.me/sleeptowns/post/1254385101<br><br>➁ https://curiouscat.me/sleeptowns/post/1254429657<br><br>➂ https://literal.club/activity/d5044870-b2c2-11ec-8080-8000223ba3d8<br><br>but yes totally agree, i also am a goldfinch over tsh truther !! i think tsh is very much bound by ideas, and how those ideas are embodied by the group and by extension romanticized by richard’s inherent need to glorify and narrativize his life, and there’s only so much one can do with that before things start straining, you know what i mean? there’s a level of deliberate coldness and detachment to tsh, and that’s its appeal. whereas theo takes center stage in the goldfinch, and whatever ideas and themes it serves comes second or at least by association to him. his grief, his inability to really move from it, how he might want to have a normal life despite it all but we both know deep down that it will never be the thing to make him happy. he’ll always want the unwantable, like richard did, but unlike richard, theo wants the things he can’t have precisely because he sees it for what they are. but anyway. that’s an oversimplification on my end, probably. i think donna tartt loved the tsh characters too much, personally, but i think she loved theo just enough to also see him for who he is. <br><br>and i didn’t finish the little friend either :( i’m not the best with southern gothic / southern idyll / southern small town with bad vibes type stories bc i struggle to feel attached to anything in it, but i was thinking of picking it up again as well to see if my current brain will have an easier time with it! idk idk we’ll see <br><br>and oooh recs i really like stories that are big from one vantage point but are at its heart small and personal and sad-happy so off the top of my head: the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne isn’t quite as intricately written but it’s also a story unfolding over years and delves into the same pursuit for elusive happiness. it’s def more comedic than it is romantic, but there’s romance and love and warmth in it. the same with less by andrew sean greer.<br><br>tysm for this q and i also hope you are having a good day 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i was thinking “why would it be a bit odd—” then i listened to the song and… oh my god. what an experience on headphones. i’m in love. it’s so — it’s so much, all at once, but in a way that just comes together and touches you in the process? trying to find a non-pretentious way to word that but that really is it. and like, whenever something makes me feel any kind of intense emotion, i always say it makes me feel sick and mean it a bit too much, but this really does make me feel sick in the best way possible, and even more knowing my writing might carry a little bit of this vibe. so thank you for taking the time to introduce me to this song — i see spiritualized has a lot more albums! and those release dates are very intriguing! — and for sharing this heartbreakingly lovely sentiment about my writing with me.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! i was wondering if you have any advice for figuring out gender identity &amp; expression? it’s something i’ve been grappling with for a some time as a teenager afab, who currently still publicly identifies as female and uses she/her pronouns, but wishes to explore beyond that (eg using they/he, more masculine appearance) and is unable to do so publicly. i apologise if this question is too personal and oversteps any boundaries — please feel free to ignore this cc if that is the case, no pressure at all! i hope you are having the loveliest time wherever you are when you receive this cc!! and i’d also like to say a great big thank you — this isn’t the first cc i’m sending in and your responses are always the kindest and most helpful.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, this is an interesting question — and no apologies necessary at all, i’m very glad you trust my space enough to ask this. but it is tricky, isn’t it? i’m not the most… solid, for lack of a better adjective, about my own gender identity. but i don’t see that as a lack, either. i go by vibe, mostly. which is a very flippant way to talk about it, maybe, but there it is. i know what i’m not, and while that doesn’t automatically inform me what i am, it’s still something. i avoid what i’m not, and most days, that’s enough. <br><br>but the thing is, i don’t have any advice regarding the things you are unable to do publicly. i would never want you to jeopardize your safety in the name of any kind of exploration you could be doing. it’s terrible that we live in a reality where you have to choose one over the other, but still — i don’t want to encourage anything that would leave you unsafe in any way. but that’s where the complexity is, really. in the external world, and not what you want to explore about your identity. from my experience with my own, there are no easy answers, and that doesn’t have to be a burden. it’s just something you have to try little by little, and if it works, amazing, if it doesn’t, then let’s go back to the drawing board. and i think the most you can do in terms of internal exploration is to allow yourself the space to be wrong, and to not treat every change as a big event. i know that sounds bad, but with gender identity, sometimes it really is just a nonchalant leap of faith, and then nonchalantly jumping back to the starting line if you find that you can’t commit to the original leap. and that’s fine. you’re young and your brain has so much to grow and more often than not your understanding of your gender identity will grow with you. be patient with yourself on that. <br><br>i guess the only “advice” i have is… not every step you make has to feel like a big jump where you figure it all out. for me, it’s been: unceremoniously adding they to my pronouns when i introduce myself, then he, then all three to my irl ig bio. cutting my hair really short one year, growing it back bc i felt bad, only to realize i really wanted to seem more “androgynous,” whatever that even meant, and cutting it short again. dressing and moving more “masculine.” testing out how i feel in this or that. i know this isn’t much, but just — start small. whatever that looks like. maybe asking online / trusted friends first to use “they/he,” or dressing “masculine” only one day at school. if that makes sense. there really is comfort when it clicks, and i want that comfort for you. i’m sorry this is all i have to offer, but if ever you want to talk anything through, my cc inbox is always welcome to you.</div>

 <div class=reply>i got the first volume as a gift a couple years ago and read it in one sitting! but i haven’t ventured much past that since, except maybe a few more chapters online until my attention span ran out. and from what i read, i… like it. i’m very charmed by it. it’s sweet and is written with a gentle, loving hand, even in its understandably and believably not-as-idyllic moments. it also doesn’t try to be more than what it is and instead tries to just do as much justice as possible to what it set out to be, which i appreciate about any story. i just think, overall, that i’m not compatible anymore with the age group it depicts and is meant to speak to. and that’s absolutely fine, and is actually a good sign of how much comfort it very likely brings to people who find a lot in charlie and nick and their friends to love and empathize with. i’m glad that it exists out there in the world. and i know i’ll check out the netflix adaptation later this week.</div>

 <div class=reply>before sunset, easily! while i won’t say magically skewed the trajectory of my life, it’s the kind of filmmaking i… trust in? it’s just one of those things that perfectly did everything it set out to do. whereas before sunrise was sweet and nice but lacking a little in emotional meat, reliant on us just being like, “okay, we have these two characters and we have to love them.” and before midnight had a little too much of that same idea, before sunset is that just-right goldilocks middle. we adore them in the first movie bc they’re young and charming, and we stand by them in the third bc we’ve seen their whole lives pan out, but in before sunset, in that second meeting, i think we really see all that they are. the things they resent in life, the things they still want out of it despite how much time has passed since we knew their much more idealistic younger selves. how the connection and chemistry is still there between them, in the things they’re willing to touch upon and give up. i saw someone say once that before sunset has them only wanting to revisit their youth bc the other person symbolizes that, but i don’t think they want to reconnect with their own youth in reconnecting with each other; if anything, i see it as them having grown older but remaining the same self at their core, and it’s those true selves that still speak to each other’s. that, and all i ask of a film and all i ask of a couple is good dialogue, and this film has both at its peak. like — come on. an hour and a bit of just them walking around the city, going back and forth, pushing and pulling, discussing and expanding? it’s catnip for me. there’s also just a lot of palpable trust between ethan hawke, julie delpy and richard linklater, and i love storytelling where i feel safe in placing my own trust in the people involved with these characters. so. that’s the best way i can describe it, i guess. i feel safe with what before sunset does with the very human lives it chooses to depict and how. and that safety and trust means a lot to me.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha, i hope you’re doing alright!! sorry for the annoying question but after reading some of your cc replies i realized that we have really similar taste in almost everything. for example, i think you’ve said before that the goldfinch is one of your favorite books, right? i hope i’m not wrong lmaobxnfh butttt in case i’m not, the goldfinch is also one of my all time favorite books. there are so so many other things we have in common (speaking of personal preferences) but that’s not why im sending you this. i just wanted to ask you—what are some of your favorite songs lately? i just really need some new listens and well you just look like a very good source. sorry for bothering you! have a nice day &lt;33</div>

 <div class=reply>it is one of my fav books! i often get people saying they might be tripping when they remember a detail about me, but rarely are they wrong, and i appreciate it, how much total strangers pay attention to facets of my being i otherwise find kind of uninteresting. but to have them reflected in someone else’s tastes *is* interesting so i’m very !!!! about this<br><br>some of my fav songs lately… a bunch of artists i listen to have released new singles in the past few weeks, but all around, some mainstays in my rotations this month have been: sidelines by phoebe bridgers, what a shame by lizzy mcalpine, block me out by gracie abrams, hills of fire by sarah kinsley, 202 by lovely summer chan, violet by the volunteers, luca fogale’s cover of a case of you, and sarang sarang by meenoi. but also really just — meenoi. i have a whole playlist with just her songs and it’s now my go-to for any time i need music in the background. and my guilty pleasure listening have been sako tomohisa’s キミの耳にラブソングを, which is just an album of these really nice covers from animes coated in nostalgia for me, and on the kpop front: o.o by nmixx, love dive by ive and my bag by g-idle. bc i have no discerning taste there. i do hope you can find some new listens from this otherwise monotonous list and that you have a nice day as well !!</div>

 <div class=question>last time you talked about how the kind of vulnerability we’re presenting each other right now will always be performed thing, and how that’s always just right outside the realm of true vulnerability because of how we’re carefully curating it - which is definitely fair, because the things i’m telling you right now i’ll never do while completely sober nor off-anon. at the same time, though, don’t we spend the entirety of our lives performing? i do realize that that statement has a very “we live in a society” ring to it, but still - each of us is so many things all at once, and i think it’s just physically and also metaphysically impossible to have everything out on display, whether to ourselves or to another person. so i guess my takeaway from this is - does such a thing as “true vulnerability” exist? pre-pondering me would have said yes, but just as how you’ve sworn against equating rawness to depth, i’m also grappling against compartmentalizing the world into blacks and whites (which is why i find laundry thoroughly therapeutic, because the world feels like it’s in shambles all the time and some structure is always appreciated).<br><br>this has definitely rocketed off into a tangent i did not anticipate, but i feel like all the ccs i send you do this. as always, don’t feel pressured to reply, but do know that i find your presence incredibly soothing and your thoughts immensely teaching. two main takeaways from this: please don’t ever buy discount shiraz, and that i hope you’re keeping well, reading well, and breathing well. the lilacs in my backyard are flowering - unless you’re severely allergic or dislike their scent, i’ll keep you and them in the same thoughts.<br><br>do tell me about your latest reads if you’d like.<br><br>love and light always,<br>k.

 <div class=reply>a few weeks ago — or has it been months now — i tweeted something on how everything in life is a performance, and that it isn’t a bad thing. i stand by that. i think there’s a difference between performing and performative, and while the latter touches upon some level of inauthenticity or even artifice, the former is just — what we do with each other. we can’t be multitudes to each other all the time. you’re right. i agree. but i think there is true vulnerability in which of those multitudes we choose to give each other. the way i see it, interpersonal relationships are just us offering what we can of ourselves to another person and wanting them to understand us, know us. to expect another person to see you for every single thing you are and have been and will be — that’s hubris, i think. an inherent narcissism in what we expect of each other, when it’s rare you yourself will know someone like that. but to have a person that makes a certain version of you possible, or who enlightens you about the person you can be or the person you are — isn’t that what vulnerability is? we might think vulnerability is giving in to weakness, but i don’t know if i see it that way. i think to be vulnerable is just a different kind of performing, in that the performance is for no one but our own self and the person we might share that self with. <br><br>and good books are like that, too. enlightening about some aspect of the world and existence i didn’t spend too much time with before, if only bc it took me away somewhere for a bit. i’ve read a few good books these past few months. love speech by sherry huang and the year of blue water by yanyi articulated so many things i hadn’t even thought i wanted to see in someone else’s words. bunny by mona awad was wild and campy but also wistful in what becomes of a writer’s internal world. and sea of tranquility by emily st. john mandel quieted something in me i didn’t realize needed quieting after the events of the past few years and the burden i feel, sometimes, about being an adult in a dying world. <br><br>i’m always happy to receive anything from you. you know that. sending you my love and well wishes, always. and better wine. and some lilacs, too. for a child born in the western spring, i’m not the most flora-inclined, but that doesn’t mean i am not moved by being placed alongside them in your thoughts. <br><br>thank you so much for your lovely thoughts, and i pray the next six months treat you with gentleness.</div>

 <div class=question>sha,<br><br>it's surreal how long it's been since my last ask to you. between the cc website crashing and you taking time off from social media and just life in general on my end, depending on the day i’d either tell you either three days or ten lifetimes have passed. either way it's miles off from the actual six months. time and her gentle cruelties and portioned mercies and whatnot.<br><br>either way, i hope the past six months have treated you well, or, given you the space to be with yourself in a way that seems well enough. despite what i told you last time, i never started the ali smith book. it's been gathering dust on top of my wardrobe-slash-bookshelf; but on the bright side i've been reading still, and at a much steadier rate than the past few years. <br><br>do you remember what it was like when you made your first shift into another preferred genre of reading? maybe i'm projecting my own personal experience to you, but making the switch from (mostly ya) fiction to memoirs and poetry made me feel like i aged a few decades, and i've only started reading again around august last year. it’s the same feeling as when you look at your baby pictures and then glance at the mirror, and it’s just, oh. it’s no grand realization, really - if anything it occupies as much of my attention as a cool rock on my windowsill. but the rock is heavy regardless.<br><br>i think since realizing how old my mind can feel i’ve also gotten wiser - which, as i haven’t even turned 24, seems like the exact kind of hubris someone unwise would fall prey to. i think it’s because i owe it to the authors for pinning down my rampant thoughts into words. now instead of tearing my hair out over how out of depth i feel, i can sit down in the park and annotate a book, and it feels like someone is guiding my hand and saying “this is how to say what you feel, this is how to reify it, now you can breathe”.

 <div class=reply>K. !!!! not the gentlest start, but that’s the closest approximation i have to how i reacted out loud to realizing i’ve received two new ccs from you. has it really been six months? i’ve been thinking a lot about time recently, both in the scientific sense and the philosophical sense, and the more i venture deeper into all of that, the more that time feels so… artificial? which i mean. it is. it is most definitely artificial, and if not that, then man-engineered at least. that doesn’t make it a bad thing. but it does make it an insufficient mode of measurement for lots of things, including how we experience life, let alone what life does to us. <br><br>the past six months have been… monotonous, emotionally. but alright, otherwise. my ali smith book is also stuffed into one of the bookshelves i got from a thrift store for $4, but, much like you, i’ve been reading still, and more so than i have for so many years now. i think i used to chastise myself for finishing so few books when i used to read so much — but now i don’t see it as such a terrible thing, when the things i do finish are nearly always things i like. why force myself into the act of consuming something for the sake of a numerical tally, you know? but i do have quite a few books waiting on my shelf. <br><br>that said, no, i can’t say I remember that shift. i feel the difference, certainly — in the shower, the other day, i was thinking about how high school age me would have been so bored by the songs i like now — but whether i felt that transition from one to the other, i don’t think i did. but i feel no weight in the difference. i think i’ve felt so, so old, for as long as i’ve been cognizant in this life, that right now, i’m just glad i feel settled in it at all, like i’m rightfully the age i’ve always felt. which isn’t a good thing, bc there should be a child inside me who had to grow up. but i often feel like i was born grown up, and no one told me that wasn’t quite right. <br><br>but anyway. i don’t think there’s anything wrong about feeling wiser. i was just talking to a friend today about how our 20s — when your prefrontal cortex is doing its last lap of development — have felt drastically different each year. me at 21 was not me at 22. me at 22 was not me at 23. and my current 24-year-old is the most me i’ve been, for better or for worse, and that self laughs at what i did when i was younger. but there’s no shame or guilt in that, or at least there shouldn’t be. i think you’re fine as you are, seeing wisdom where you feel there is wisdom and seeking out more where there isn’t. i think that’s the most we can do as people, as a generation trapped in the cycle of our own coming-of-age.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh i’m so relieved to hear that !! also this is only slightly related to what we were talking about, but i thought about you after a friend mentioned this site to me the other day, but it’s soundofcolleagues.com and all it is essentially is just ambient noise in the background, in case that might help you be more productive, or get into that kind of… headspace? i guess? it seems like such a tiny thing but sometimes this sort of thing is the difference bw me writing a few sentences and writing nothing at all. but anyway. nothing to do with resources, but i was tossing and turning in bed wishing i’d mentioned it, so thank you for replying again. <br><br>if you ever do read the sxf fic, i hope you like, and i hope your exam went well and that you get some rest soon 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>THE WAY YOU RESPONDED ON HERE SJSHS but no like actually full seriousness even if someone were to tell me they’ll pay for my car, my insurance, my license and all its renewals — nothing will beat whatever side-tier of existence i unlock on public transportation. the dream is to live in a walkable community, but until then, i’ll revel in the privileges of getting to chill during a commute.</div>

 <div class=question>YAY ITS A POSITIVE ANSWER.<br>ok im shooting you the silly questions (and you can add more info to them as you please!): why is it a complicated rs? what’s your favorite thing about public commuting? have you ever gone on a roadtrip (as driver or passenger)? do you know how to park well? when you’re behind the wheel, do you listen to music? what are your favorite driving songs (or music genres for driving)? do you work well with maps, do you not need them or do you prefer gps apps? are cars just a mean of transportation to you or do you like to stay inside them doing other things? and finally! tell me a driving experience you had! &lt;3 <br>thank you for answering and i hope you have a nice easter (if you celebrate it! if you don’t, then enjoy the easter eggs or any chocolate of your choice! and if you don’t eat/like chocolate, then have a nice weekend🕺)</div>

 <div class=reply>ooohhh it’s a complicated rs bc the person who used to own the car put me through things that will take more than a lifetime to undo, shall we say. my fav thing about public commuting is that i get to zone out and float away from the immediacy of real life! i put my headphones on and i’m mentally, emotionally and physically unreachable for however long the ride is. i have gone on a roadtrip, but only as a passenger! i have a driving playlist specifically for when the roads are emptier in the evening onwards (https://spoti.fi/3uJBI32) but in terms of what i gravitate to: same public transportation idea about floating away, though with a bit of manual speed attached to it. i’m shockingly infallibly good with directions, at least intuitively in an area i’ve been to at least once and with physical maps + gps apps while driving, but phone maps apps while walking are a no-go. i think they’re clunky and unhelpful and i’d really rather just walk one direction and figure it out from faded street signs in another language than rely on a vague arrow on a screen. like, i think i might genuinely harbor anger for maps phone apps. i’m ambivalent to cars in the daytime but they’re my fav hangout place at night! i’ve formed many friendships just spending hours in the car talking after a movie, eating drive-thru fast food and/or scream-singing to kpop/anime themes/musicals in a car. <br><br>a driving experience i had… no notable ones worth telling, really. i’m a very uneventful person to be around, and not even cars change that, i’m sure. i just know i really like being driven at night. there’s a very specific peace to it, a kind of stillness that you don’t really get in daylight even if every other thing remains the same. so mostly, i just have a scattered collection of fond memories being dropped off by a friend after a movie, or being picked up by a friend at 4am after i come back from an impromptu trip to another province, or just having night class with my best friend and us getting chicken wings at the nearest pub to eat in the car. there are lots and lots of late nights in my life, and a lot of them are also defined by the cars that bookend those nights and the friends in those cars with me. they’re virtually indivorceable, in that.<br><br>but yeah haha i am so so sorry it sounds like you were expecting me to have interesting things to say about this topic but i really do not have an interesting daily life at all, let alone in my rs with cars and transportation. but i do appreciate you taking the time to drop by and ask nonetheless, so thank you so much, and whether or not you celebrate easter, happy long weekend to you !!</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhh like writing guides / advice / how-tos and such? i’m afraid i don’t :( my general approach towards writing is just jump out the plane and pray i have a parachute that will work; the result is that i have difficulty being compatible with learning writing through resources that tell me universal rules for writing. what helps me write is usually just my google keep for stray fragmentary thoughts, a book i’m reading to… i guess switch on (i just rolled my eyes, but it’s for lack of a better verb i’m sorry) my brain for writing, and for brainstorming and all that, i find that i respond well to the sound of running water.<br><br>oh but i do like getting to hear about other writers’ process! lithub, catapult and hazlitt are quite useful for that, as is the marginalian and the paris review. i find that i feel less disconnected to writers’ very specific, personal approach to their own works than i do broad rules like “don’t use adverbs at all” or “use first person pov.” in that regard, some of my fav writing essays are: ugly, bitter and true by suzanne rivecca, lightness by italo calvino and the carrier bag theory of fiction by ursula k. le guin, and a few favs that come to mind from the paris review’s art of fiction series were alice munro, toni morrison and james salter’s.<br><br>i’m sorry i can’t be more helpful, and best of luck to you on your writing endeavours 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i do know how to drive! but i only resort to it as a final choice bc a) i have a complicated relationship with the car i have and b) i am very lucky to live in an area of the city where public commute is a relaxing experience for me, so i prefer it over any other mode of transportation. but yes yes yes hit me with the not-silly-at-all-i’m sure little questions !!</div>

 <div class=reply>it depends! i struggle a lot with attention span and usually if i’ve been writing too much on one kind of screen i have to switch to another for at least a couple of months. i also have my preferences about the keyboards i type on if i’m not on my phone, and that tends to play a part?<br><br>but anyway i am on your side completely !!! i’ve been writing near exclusively on my phone these days bc my attention span just doesn’t stick around on my laptop and i see nothing wrong with that + it will likely change again in a month or two. i’m an advocate for changing the environment you write in if you’re having trouble writing, whether going to another room or literally going outside, and i think that applies to what you’re writing on as well. so. i’m sure your friends are wonderful people, but i’ll be lying if i don’t gently and respectfully disagree with being prescriptive about where someone prefers to write. it’s such a small, insignificant detail to me, personally, let alone something to consider a “sin.” if handwriting on a napkin at a random dingy restaurant is what works, then i support that. and like — being rigid about this sort of thing makes me itch. it’s always people who get hung up on small things like those that end up being unable to write, or only being able to write in certain specific conditions, neither of which are very conducive for writing in the long run. i’m sure that’s not the case with your friends, and i’m sure you don’t need defending from their lighthearted statements, but in any case, again, i’m completely on your side and i fully support you writing on your phone. don’t let anyone else tell you what works best for your writing.</div>

 <div class=reply>i consider myself… a lapsed catholic. by culture, by ritual, by practice, all of that stuff. idk. i don’t subscribe to catholicism, nor do i participate in it widely anymore, but i always think of hanif abdurraqib saying, “i miss ritual more than i miss religion. it is good to have somewhere to be &amp; a song that carries you there.” so. that’s where i’m at. i miss catholic rituals more than i miss religion. <br><br>that said, i don’t consider myself non-religious, either. or at least not in the sense that i’m atheist. i’m not. i believe in a god of a sort, or multiple gods, just any kind of celestial power, whatever, i don’t care about the details so much as i do mere existence. i think it’s hubris otherwise, bc mostly i just struggle to believe something didn’t create the universe. whether that something is divinity or literally just a few sparks that accidentally led to the big bang, doesn’t matter. i think the world is too intricate, and at that, too prone to coincidence. <br><br>with that in mind, i don’t believe in a deliberate godly power. i don’t believe in a “god’s plan” nor do i believe in prayer as either a wish or penance. if there’s a divine power out there, it has no hand in my life, and whatever forgiveness or help i ask for, that divine power won’t be the one from whom i ask for it. prayer is ritual for me. that’s all. and religion is just believing in creation. nothing more and nothing less, if that makes sense. and also i never recovered from finding out about pascal’s wager. but even then i’m not interested in having a higher power over my life, let alone a god dictating what’s right and what’s wrong for me. <br><br>sorry this is a strange little ramble now but therein is my relationship with religion</div>

 <div class=reply>hellllloooo again what a bright and cheerful start to your cc! welcome back, thank you for dropping by, etc. but most importantly, i am very glad to hear you’re surviving spring bc everyone seems to be dropping like flies and succumbing to end of school year stress and covid spikes and such !! so please take care out there !! <br><br>but no omg not an odd question at all, i love getting new big ones to chew on! and this is a super interesting one. i don’t think there is a congruency to them at all, though, honestly. i tend to write pairings that include at least one of my favourite characters from the series, but even then, there isn’t often a shared trait in most of those characters. so. huh. i need to think about this some more, probably, but as far as pairings i like, i don’t think i have a type at all. it is what it is, and sometimes, a pairing just happens to catch me when i’m in dire need of a hyperfixation, or maybe someone nearby whose opinion and taste i trust has been particularly persuasive. <br><br>as for pairings i write, specifically, not just pairings i like, i do love a little push and pull in the dynamic. a little unfolding that needs to happen, some sort of active choice to understand each other. that can look different for each pairing, but — to backtrack and try answering your question again, most of my fav characters, i gravitate to bc they contain multitudes. most pairings i like, i gravitate to bc they include one of my fav characters. so i suppose it only goes to show that the pairings i like to write demand a bit of unpacking of those multitudes, whatever form they might take. love is in the knowing, and knowing is in the desire and the capacity to understand, and through all of that, the choice to be two people loving each other. or something. i like complicatedly simple and simply complicated characters. i like seeing them in relationships, trying to understand another person and having to reroute their own understanding of self in the process. such is the joy of relationships, and it’s always much fun unwrapping all of that. and i like fun. i always say i never write plot, and i don’t. i write characters i find fun, and plot is what accidentally comes out of that, and i think that says more about the characters i choose to write than about me. that being said, some characters are wonderful on their own but stale / stagnant in certain pairings or dynamics. some of those, i can respect without actively engaging in and many others, i just don’t find fun or interesting. but anyway, this is a distant tangent waiting to happen. thank you so much for the q and i hope the rest of your spring treats you kindly 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hellooo sha !! i feel bad coming here and not asking a question. because honestly i just want to say something and i hope that's okay, and you definitely don't need to reply or anything, and so sorry if im not making sense, i have no sleep but i do have many feelings right now and that's a bad combo but i wanted to write this out aa<br><br>i haven't written in about 4 years. i had a heart that was always too full, but i couldn't write it out anymore. i felt like shutting myself up, it was a cruel thing i did to myself but it was because of the cards i was dealt back then. plus i have RSD :( regardless though, i was thinking about the words i WOULD write every day. i would pick apart sentences and words i loved in any piece of writing i read. i let some of it out in small ways sometimes, i could never fully ignore it, but i'd close my notebook or hide the doc and never look at it again. but through everything, i felt that tug, you know? that feeling of pulling, my heart to my fingers, in the back of my head i knew i wanted to write more. it showed in the way i couldn’t get rid of it all.<br><br>then you happened !! the more i read your fics, tweets, and your newsletters, i just felt something growing and growing in my chest. ever since i found your ao3 on a random day in maybe november, i feel like a knot in my heart was slowly being pulled to being undone. when i saw your newsletter about laurel hell it finally pulled it apart for me. so randomly in the middle of it i realized i loved it so much, it hit me right in my heart. because i’ve always wanted to write about my favorite albums like that but i never let myself think i should. seeing you do it made me sooo happy, made me think, why do i not let myself do these things !! who says i’m not allowed to express my thoughts and feelings !!! i cannot tell you how delighted i was to read it all. it was such a happy heart wrenching realization for me, how much i’ve missed writing. i’m even going to pursue studying english this year if i can get things in order this year !! how crazy honestly !!<br><br>i feel like i can write now and face some fears. and i've been trying to !! this impacted me so positively, you are a part of the reason why i’ve been growing and healing with so much love. i resonate with so much of your writing (seriously, i admire how transparent you choose to be in your newsletters and look forward to them so much !!) in so many ways and i'm just very happy to able to read it all. i could say a lot of this a lot better but i don’t want to make this any longer aa v-v thank you for listening to all this if you have, even though it’s so much and a bit heavy (sorry about that), i basically just wanted to say you’re my favorite writer. and your writings will have a special place in my heart forever. i really hope you’re doing well and that your heart never feels too empty, thank you sm !! &lt;333</div>

 <div class=reply>HELLO NO OH MY GOD DON’T FEEL BAD. SERIOUSLY. THIS IS SO OKAY. IT’S MORE THAN OKAY. THANK YOU FOR DROPPING BY DESPITE SLEEP DEPRIVATION. <br><br>but also, jesus, i don’t know how to respond to something as mind-shatteringly touching as, “and then you happened.” what the hell. oh my goodness. thank you so much. or — it feels strange, even, to be thanking you for it, even though i am wracked with so much gratitude. thank you, i suppose, not just for the sentiment, but for sharing this with me. i know how it feels to be in that — clogged state, almost. i think of it as not being on friendly terms with the writing space? the urge to write is there, at times even the words, but the space on which you can write them all out makes you feel unwelcome. <br><br>but ahhh i am putting words in your mouth this is all to say that i can’t imagine how rough it was to have been in that period for four years, and i feel so much secondhand relief at how you described letting the words pour out of you. like, i’m not even kidding, my chest got lighter as i got farther down your cc. and to think that the catalyst was the laurel hell write-up, of all things! my god. but see, that’s it. the most freeing thing i gave myself in the last year was permission to just write whatever. which i know sounds stupid and basic, but honestly, i think that writing sometimes asks for a lot from us that we have this unconscious thought that okay, but where is this even gonna go? and we add the pressure of expectation to our writing. what is the purpose of this, what is the so-and-so. and that’s not very conducive half of the time. bc you’re right !! who says you’re not allowed to express whatever the hell you want !! there’s no ‘should’ in writing. idk. never been a fan of all that. if the words are there, they’re there. you just write what feels right. i wanna say there’s a reason those two words are homophones. <br><br>you say you’ve missed writing but it sounds to me like writing has missed you. it makes me smile, truly, so thank you for sharing all of this, for being so thoughtful and generous about my writing even when we should be celebrating yours first and foremost (!!) this cc just… blew my heart apart in the best way possible. so please don’t apologize. and you’re very sweet to credit me, but i truly do think all your positive change is on you. a thing of mine might have contributed a spark here and there at most, sure, but it’s all you, what you did with them. and from my distance here, i am very proud and moved to hear about it all. i wish you all the best.</div>

 <div class=reply>OH GOD TYSM but like — question it in a good way? or a bad way? bc the last thing i want is to be impeding your healing process. i always feel a little bad — sometimes shame, but most often self-conscious guilt — at treating my main twitter like a public diary, bc i understand that some of the personal things i talk about and articulate might have universal implications and such, or at least meanings that might be different for everyone reading the tweets with their own experiences. so. i hope it’s been in the good way. or i hope that it’s been helpful, at least. maybe not to the healing but to figuring out how to go about the healing. thank you for dropping by with this thoughtful message 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oh god what a bad time for me to reply so late… and without a good answer at that. this is the sort of thing where i kinda just sit next to you, metaphorically, and admit that sometimes — it just happens. friendships end without us anticipating it, realizing it, and at times, even without us causing it. i don’t know how your life is, but i do know that there is no shortage of friendships in the world. it’s the one rs we can have an infinite amount of, and also the one we have to keep choosing to make into what it is. i think we have a lot more leeway to be ourselves in our friendships, and sometimes that means talking to the people you feel slipping away, and if they really don’t want to stay, if they drift away nonetheless, then let them. i know that’s cold of me to say, but i don’t think it’s unfair, to myself or to them, to let people who want to go… go. <br><br>if you can honestly say you did the work of communicating where you’re at and their response was to treat that like it’s worth nothing, then that, for me, cements where i’d want that friendship to go. which is to say, nowhere. bc there are other friendships out there that i could putting my time and energy into, and it need not be these ones. what can we gain from a friendship that we have to exhaust ourselves over, you know what i mean? friendship can be so fulfilling and so loving on both sides and if it’s not, then is it really a friendship? and if you have to ask yourself *if* something’s even a friendship, then — i don’t know. i’m the sort of person who looks at that, blinks, and flicks it behind me without a second glance. again, coldly, maybe, but life is too short and the world too wide to be on our bedroom floor beating ourselves up for the friendships we understandably couldn’t maintain singlehandedly. any relationship takes two. if you’re doing the work of two people and it fails, that’s not on you. if they keep going back on their word, that’s not on you. if they can’t communicate whether or not they have any problems with you even after you’ve asked them to, that’s not on you. you meet other people halfway, but halfway is the farthest you can go. if they want to go the other direction, then — it’s okay. you will be okay. i know it’s easiest said than in practice, bc loneliness and aloneness are terrible company, but i think you’re worth more than the friendships that take from you, is all. grieve what you need to, but don’t linger on ended relationships as failures on your part alone. <br><br>i’m sorry that i don’t have kinder, more comforting words to say. but i love friendships. friendships are wonderful. and if the ones you have haven’t been much of that, then i promise you there is no shortage of strangers out there you’ll find very much rewarding to love and be loved by.</div>

 <div class=reply>to be perfectly honest, i don’t really know? i can’t imagine it would be. i also highly doubt that it’s sold over the counter / without a prescription in the dosage that induces sleep or antidepressant effects, so please don’t take my indifference to my medications as a green-light to do the same. always be responsible with your meds, from painkillers to melatonin to whatever it might be, etc. just because i don’t question the meds i’m given doesn’t mean i’m advocating for that or saying it’s a good thing. it isn’t. these things need to be prescribed for a reason, etc.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha !!! i hope this is not too personal or invasive. your recent tweets, about writing and beginning something new; have me aching for you in a way that is familiar, and all i want to say is that i hope that with the spring that is coming once again (the weather in ontario is so unstatic !! i hate the random changes, quite personally). your writing, even as when described by you as sleep med thoughts, is always so lovely. getting in the groove of writing where you feel your writing is at an exceptional level is always something i have trouble doing :[ i would never wish that state of not exactly writer's block, or more unglamorized, like words-do-not-come-at-all block, on anybody and i am sure that you are the last person who i'd ever consider to give it to ! please, do know that you can do this, and that your writing will always be yours, even if you just wrote 'oh fuck'. wishing u the besteststst &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>not at all omg if anything this was a much-needed burst of warmth after a whole day of being sisyphus pushing up a boulder, etc. but anyway. isn’t the weather unbelievable! i swear i was out in a sweater just a couple days ago so how is it that i was shovelling snow today. happens every year, though, and what is spring in ontario if not all four seasons visiting in a single day. <br><br>but thank you so much for your kind view of my words, sweet, wonderful stranger. it really cheered me up to see this before i pop the sleep meds in and give up on writing for the day despite writing like half-sentences at most. i think i’ve been spoiled a little by how i don’t really ever feel the words-do-not-come-at-all block anymore these days, but somehow it’s worse that the words are there but the momentum and the brain power to match what they need aren’t, so it’s eating away internally instead. like having a clogged nose you can’t clear even when you’re blowing so hard your eyes are watering, so you’re just stuck trying to find other, less laborious ways to breathe. it’s exhausting when writing feels exhausting. i don’t like being drained by it, or when i feel like it’s a chore, bc then i don’t want to do it, and that doesn’t leave me with much to emotionally subsist off, you know? but that’s on me for allowing myself to be a writer first and a human being last. i don’t know. i don’t even need my writing to be exceptional. i never think it is anyway, and i never expect greatness from it. i just want the words to exist, and for those existing words to be the right ones.<br><br>so it’s difficult, when i can’t even have the existing. but i am now vomiting all over this nice message so really, truly, incredibly, thank you for brightening up my day with this little message. sending u love and a less wishy-washy spring as we move into april !!</div>

 <div class=question>hi, shaa ! is it okay to ask for some advice? these days, i'm really having a hard time writing. i can write in small chunks but those almost always are never enough to these running thoughts in my brain. i really like writing, but i feel kind of disconnected from it due to past experiences with getting plagiarized and stuffs. it feels frustrating to want to do something so eagerly yet do not have the courage to do so. is there anything you could give a 4teen year old writer who's been in a year-long writing slump? because i really, really, want to have words in my pockets, always, again. for whatever you will reply, thank u !</div>

 <div class=reply>writing when you feel disconnected from it is the woooorst god i’m so sorry to hear that, and that it came in the aftermath of something that i imagine dealt quite a bit of damage to your relationship with writing. <br><br>when we can’t quite write in a way that can gain momentum, i usually say it’s either burnout or an inability to get into what psychology might call a flow state, where you can’t tap into it and really just. you know. be alone with the words. as pretentious as that sounds. if it’s burnout, i really have no other advice but to allow yourself a break. writing in huge, long spurts takes a lot of stamina, not even necessarily talent or direction, and that takes a toll when you’re not used to writing in long uninterrupted in the zone periods. if you can’t write, your brain might be trying to tell you it’s a bit fried at the moment and needs to take more creatively than it’s able to give right now, etc.<br><br>but you did mention a year-long writing slump, so it’s very likely not burnout but the other one. ofc i don’t know the finer details of your situation, but if you’re having difficulty being alone with your words and just letting them run — it’s prob exactly bc you’re not alone with them? it’s likely that you’re letting hesitation or fear or even determination / desperation to write do the writing alongside you, and that’s not a super conducive state of mind. nothing else should govern what you’re writing but your own rs with it and what you intend to do with your words, which i know is easier said than done, and is a very basic thing for me to point out, but sometimes people get so caught up in the subconscious overthinking that they don’t even notice they’re not really focusing on the simple act of writing and writing alone. but it’s tricky to address this, and what’s worked for me in the past was just looking for other forms of writing i haven’t tried before, that haven’t been ~stained by a bad experience or overthinking. for example, if fiction prose isn’t working atm bc my brain’s trying to do too much and ends up doing too little, i switch over to writing an essay, maybe, or a dialogue-only screenplay, where there are subtle but significant changes in the things i need to make it work. that way, i can focus on only getting word after another down, and the thinking that made writing a bit sisyphus-like can kinda take the backseat.<br><br>and if it’s courage you need — plenty of writing doesn't need to be for anyone but yourself. if you must be afraid, be afraid after or before but never during. worry about the fear after you’ve written the thing, or be as afraid as you want before but don’t let it get in the way of the act of writing, you know?<br><br>ahhh but i realize broad fragments of advice like this don’t help very much for a personal situation. i really am very sorry and i hope you can find something to unclog this predicament :(</div>

 <div class=reply>the tone of this q is so thoughtful and cheerful but oh my god my sweet friend i have not seen a single one 😭 i know what each of them are like and i'm never entirely detached from the state of the film world, but altogether, i just don't feel any eagerness about any of the best picture norms this year, if that makes sense? i do see a few of other movies i'd like to check out in the other categories, though! and i'm still deliberating on whether finding out if i'll absolutely love or absolutely hate drive my car is worth the three hours.</div>

 <div class=question>shaa, what are your opinions about gatekeeping?</div>

 <div class=reply>saw this tiktok once that was like, “i do the opposite of gatekeeping. you will be forced to like my interests. you Will listen.” and i feel like that’s my general attitude towards the stuff i like — though at the same time, i’m only comfortable of truly leaning into that with people i have one on one dynamics with. so. idk. i don’t feel the impulse to gatekeep. that doesn’t mean i don’t have that desire sometimes, but in terms of whether it’s worth any thought or energy enforcing on my part, i don’t feel it is? <br><br>i think, all around, unless we’re talking about signature lip colours and scents and all that stuff on platforms that will have them selling out, i just find gatekeeping an exhausting and ultimately impossible labour. like, how successfully can you truly gatekeep something, and how much self-conceit is necessary to ever even assume that this one thing can only be concentrated within the space you decide? i completely understand being protective and territorial about the stuff we like, and i know for a fact that the reason i am so hesitant and careful about the spaces i occupy online is precisely bc i’m protective of my relationships with my interests and fixations. but do i ever really think there’s such a thing as being able to “gatekeep” something, let alone have i ever wanted to? no. not really. it’s just. a big question mark for me, that instinct. it’s not like my self is so tied to a thing that to protect it is to protect myself, too. <br><br>which isn’t to say i don’t have trouble understanding how some people can consume the same media i do and yet be okay yassifying or woobifying or dead dove-ing the life out of it. that stuff puts me off as much as anyone else. but to dictate who’s a legitimate fan or who’s not, or wishing to keep a thing away from the rest of the world to preserve its special-ness to you? i’d argue that’s rooted in flawed logic or misplaced sentiment. i mean — it takes me five minutes to get into liking anything, and around the same time to uncover the entire academic career of my best friend’s new boyfriend. even the most obscure music have, what, a thousand listens on spotify? what does gatekeeping even look like? i think people tend to conflate something being ~niche with them not seeing it around much in their corner of the internet, but perception does not always equal truth. i’m wary of the instinct to project your impossible need to have a special identity onto your impossible desire to keep something indie. if it’s been produced, and it’s online, how niche is niche, really, you know? <br><br>again, i get wanting to gatekeep bc you know a wider audience will bastardize this thing you love. i feel the same way. does wanting something make it possible, necessarily? i really don’t think so. and if something’s too conceptual or abstract to be of any use thinking about, then my personal approach is to just… don’t 😅</div>

 <div class=reply>the way you noticed omg that’s impressive <br><br>but ahhh i was a bit of an outlier case. i had a little problem i had to talk to a member on the team about &amp; they were very kind to switch the username over as we sorted out the issue. otherwise, i’m told they do not allow username changes at the moment, unfortunately. i’m sorry i can’t be of more help :(</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh you’re absolutely right about it being something i’d enjoy! i had my eyes set on it from the casting news to the trailer, and i did end up watching the first episode — but i’m just not the best at meditatively watching things right now, full stop, and am a bit fatigued by 90s nostalgia visuals at the moment. and that’s not at all on twenty-five twenty-one, just how life’s been recently. it really does seem right up my alley, and i’ll try anything kim tae-ri chooses, and that’s also why it’s one of those things that’s Such a guaranteed comfort watch that i want to save it for when i can give it proper attention and heart, if that makes sense? but it’s been a joy seeing it on my tl and fingers crossed life slows down soon and i just get to sit with it for a day or a weekend !!</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you for reading so promptly and sending such a thoughtful cc, what the hell. this is so nice, thank you so much; i really, really enjoyed writing it, so much more than i was expecting when i first found the note that prompted the letter, so the warm response is both super validating and unbelievably moving. <br><br>and ahhhh good guess — and not too far off, considering you can probably play me an infinite title track now and muscle memory will still kick in — but i was talking about got7, actually! much later into my teens, whereas infinite and shinee were much earlier, and from the previous kpop generation altogether. (shinee was the other concert i mentioned, though. the one i attended just a few months before what happened with jonghyun.)</div>

 <div class=question>hello sha, I hope you're well! I've been thinking about maybe making a twt separate from my irl's for writing and general thoughts on art and lit should I have the urge to send them to the void (and knowing im sending this ask, the urge is indeed there). do you have any tips on making a space that generates comfort in that? I think the circle of people you regularly interact with all seem wonderful and have more or less the kind of energy I want to settle into as well :,)</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh so many of the ccs i’m answering today are greeting me by name, how nice is that !! but hi, i hope you are also well !! <br><br>i don’t know if i’ve really put much thought into cultivating a space so much as i kind of fell into all this. i think it’s more that i’ve been lucky with the people kind enough to give me their time and thoughts than i have been active with pursuing or even be deserving of this circle. i think i occupy a rather tricky position on twt in that i’m not strictly part of one fandom even if i participate in fandom spaces, so what i get is a wonderfully eclectic group of opinions and rts and work on my tl. but i do try to be as cognizant as possible of my age and life position when i’m talking to others, esp with those substantially younger. in that, it’s resulted in me being quite passive in my interactions on here. i don’t really… initiate as much as i could have if my situation was different, unless there’s a misunderstanding i want to clear up to ease any anxieties that might linger, or unless the original tweet was posed as a question, or unless i am quietly reacting to a mutual’s work. a lot of that is bc with me being me, i don’t want to assume anything for other people or overstep. <br><br>with all that in mind, i wouldn’t want to inadvertently advise you to do the opposite of being careful on that front. but so long as you have that care and stay faithful to it, in the words you write and the ones you give to others, then i think slowly but steadily you will be more than okay. while i don’t have much advice to give on how to make friends actively, i will say that the one thing i’ve consciously tried to do as best as i can to — i guess, generate comfort, to use your term — is to just. offer as much as i can to conversations. i don’t know how good i am at it, but i want to be as generous a reader as i am a writer, and i think that’s even more important with all the wonderful people i’m lucky to trade words with. so i think. with writing &amp; art, there’s always the temptation to stay self-contained, to protect ourselves but also to honour the sacredness of our own thoughts — but at some point i just thought. to hell with that. there is so much to be learned from and offered to conversation. so i guess my advice for generating comfort is to be comfortable with opening yourself and your words up to others. curate what you can, don’t be afraid of what you can’t. touch people, touch works of art, to quote blue period.<br><br>i know this isn’t the most helpful, but my take is that it’s only in being open and honest with our love that other people can love us the same way, and that is true with art-sharing spaces.</div>

 <div class=question>hi there! i hope this isn’t too heavy of an ask because you should always do what’s right for you, but just in light of you coming back i need to say that i enjoy reading your tweets so much. they’re seriously like a breath of fresh air to me in this stupid little bird app. and, while we’re on the topic, every time i re-read your fics i feel optimistic about my life again and just…. calm. i don’t mean to put any pressure on you, i’m someone who deletes posts and deactivates and feels really weird about being perceived constantly, but i did just want to pop in that and say as long as you’re writing online i will be reading it! hopefully i can send a better ask about how much your work and thoughts mean to me but today you just get vomit</div>

 <div class=reply>hi !! i run into danger of sounding like a broken record but it really does mean an unbelievable much to hear so many people be so warm in welcoming me back while still also being so considerate and respectful about my boundaries. it’s hard to feel human sometimes, in this stupid little bird app, to borrow your words, especially when it feels like all i do is throw out my thoughts and messages to the void without getting another voice from all that. and that’s fine, it’s literally the whole idea and the appeal of twitter, but my point is that it’s so, so unexpected and so very sweet, to have someone take the time to be nice to me about all this and more. in a way, i think i needed to hear this? and you’re just. so careful with how you word what you mean to say. i don’t think it’s vomit at all. i think it’s extremely, Extremely touching. thank you so much, for this, for your kindness and the generosity of your heart towards my words. <br><br>and cheers to our shared discomfort of being perceived constantly 😔</div>

 <div class=reply>omg yes !!! i remember this post… someone thought it was a line from one of my fics, and it got all mixed up with the actual quotes, and it was all really unfortunate — but yes! exactly. so many friendships are so harmless, and so it's those that have more staying power, bc there’s less hurt, less baggage. sure, there might be a moment of sadness when you see an old polaroid of you and a friend you no longer talk to, but that passes, often without the clench of needing to throw the photo out. you allow those feelings to stay, even when they’re not entirely good all the time. you let yourself carry those details of other people’s lives, even if they aren’t in yours anymore.<br><br>had to take a break from this to tweet about it but it’s also cool to me that when they make you do those little security questions, it always asks you for details about your early life. things harder to access for people who haven’t lived your life, and so even the tech overlords decided that those are the details specific to you and only you, the details that ensure you are yourself. it’s a weird roundabout humanity in something designed against cyber shenanigans. but anyway.</div>

 <div class=reply>my thoughts on friendship breakups is that you are allowed to grieve them the way you would any other relationship. i think people have the tendency to minimize the emotional toll that losing a friendship has bc we are taught to minimize the value of strictly platonic love, but i stand by my tweets the other day that for better or for worse, our friendships are defined by all the love left over from everything else, or from lack thereof. i’d argue then that it hurts all the more when we lose a friendship bc really, how often does that happen? sure, people drift apart, but an actual, proper breakup? to not just lose someone to the natural passage of time but to feel that existence rip away from your side? of course you’d have to grieve that in your own way. <br><br>often, when we lose friendships, we are losing so much more than just someone’s presence. we are losing an entire friendship’s worth of inside jokes, or the ease of just picking up the phone to message them a meme, or knowing that even the bits you don’t share with your partner now have nowhere to go. that stuff hurts, especially if the friendship ends badly. bc now all of that past stuff is stained by those last few moments, when it was good once, wasn’t it? it was always so good, in its own way. not like how fights are more common in romantic relationships, or how we don’t really expect our parents to fully understand us. that isn’t the case with friends. sometimes, they just get it. we love them for that. and so it hurts, when we lose the comfort of that understanding. <br><br>but — and i know this sounds bad — it’s also true that friends come and go. there’s no shortage of people out there in the world who will be our friends, who will love us and understand us as friends do. so i think… the only way to really “deal” with friendship breakups is to allow yourself space to feel all the complicated knot of emotions you do about it, if that is indeed how you feel, and the rest will come with the ebbing and flowing of life and the interpersonal relationships that fill it up. it’s funny, bc even those friendships of mine that ended so terribly, i still have fondness for these days, even if it’s been years, even if i can be incredibly petty otherwise. it’s just a different kind of love there. it will always hurt, bc of that. i’ll always be wistful. but i also love the friends i have now, and for those, the most we can do is try our best in the moment. and if the past calls here and there, let yourself have a second to look through the peephole, see a familiar face, but you don’t need to keep opening it. let yourself acknowledge what’s familiar. it need not be more. <br><br>sending all the love and warmth. i hope this situation unfolds gently for you the rest of the way 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>what is your process for planning a fic? i often find myself with some notion or idea or emotions i want to capture in writing, but i struggle to develop it into an actual story. apologies if you have answered this question before.</div>

 <div class=reply>no please don’t apologize !! i have answered it a couple of times but i’m not even gonna bother looking for older replies bc tbh it’s never really been very helpful for anyone whenever i answer 😅 <br><br>but uh. i don’t really plan fics. in a way, the non-planning is the process for me; i’m more of a “get a random idea for a theme or a line of dialogue and file that into my notes app for expanding later” and try to write around that initial note until the world fills itself out into something more full. i’m a chaser, in that sense; i like to run after what the story wants to be. but that’s just how it works for me, you know? some people like to outline the plot ahead down to the smallest detail, others prefer to work off moodboards, etc. it’s not really my place to make the call on what kind of writer you are, if you know what i mean. so i’m afraid i can’t really answer this question too specifically. <br><br>that said, i mentioned being a chaser, and a thing i realized after finishing my longest fic so far is that this relies a lot on generating momentum in my scenes? often, when writers struggle with developing a story, it’s bc the story isn’t going anywhere, period. and that’s not a reflection of a fault of yours at all so much as it just means you’re stuck on the first step. so what’s been helpful for me to notice in my writing is that i often have to engineer movement somewhere with the idea or the line of dialogue i want to write. i think i told someone before that making the idea or line reactionary is the easiest shortcut to it, and i stand by that. so like, as an example, say you want a sombre mood at dinner. and all you have are two people sitting across from each other at a table, and you don’t really know where to go from there. usually i start making up what happened before that moment, fleshing out their lives and individual psychologies as i go along. maybe it’s quiet bc there’s smth one of them wants to tell the other, and that introduces qs like, so then why aren’t they saying it? what are they feeling and why? and why now, why dinner? why this person? and if i’m struggling with that, too, i’ll just give one of them an intense sentence to say so i’ll be forced to generate context. <br><br>reading back all that now, though, i realize it all sounds like basics that go unsaid. so i’m sorry if it’s not very helpful, but that really is the extent of how i go about writing.</div>

 <div class=question>hi hello !! hope you're well ! i wanted to say welcome back im really happy to see you back !! but i wanted to say i hope it's okay to be back? i dont quite know how to word this. i guess i also understand how comfortable it is to be on priv rather than public, and i hope you aren't forcing yourself to be present when you don't want to !! so many exclamation marks here lmao forgive me im so sleepy<br><br>i wanted to tell you your tweets about how you're content about not wanting a relationship (from a long while ago) really resonated w me and i thought about it for days. like it made me realize where i am in life rn !! i've been single for a year now, and this is the loongest ive spent by myself without attaching myself to another in like 6/7 years lol bc i started dating pretty young, and im just 20 now. and sure it was hard at first but i feel like knowing myself from the things i do and feel, now independent from the influence of whoever i was infatuated with, feels so so rewarding. i realized how much i fuse with the people i attach myself to, and not in a good way lol. during those years i felt like an extension of my partners, like there are sweet ways that can be possible but ii dont think i ever had space to fully be myself. i realized, the past year i've been finally letting myself build my own world, of the things that i love and can freely hyperfixate on as well like i didn't get to love this much before because i was so convinced by many it was all meant to be for one thing, one person. anyway sorry my rant aside, what you said about loving your internal and external word way too much to share it with anyone now made me realize, holy shit, i feel this way too now. it was just such a new feeling to me i didnt even realize. and it was such a fulfilling realization and i loved the way you expressed it.<br><br>so thank you. for just being you on the internet whenever you can. i appreciate it in many ways !! ur just a delight to see on the tl every time ^-^ and though i'd definitely miss you i wouldn't blame u for only wanting to be a part of a small bubble on twitter, so take care of yourself !!</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my god? oh my god. thank you. seriously. you don’t know how much it means to me to hear something that might seem as simple as “i hope it’s okay to be back.” i’m figuring out my comfort levels as i go along, but it really means the world to see all the warm welcome backs and the considerate understanding here. <br><br>and whoa… thank you as well for trusting me with your story and your thoughts. i can only imagine how it’s been like to spend so much of your youth in orbit around another person — which in itself isn’t a bad thing, but i do think you’re right in how that must have complicated figuring yourself out. i agree that there are sweet ways to be an extension of your partner, but it’s even more important to have the space to be fully yourself. you don’t need to be complete or settled or anything like that to really earn a relationship, i believe, but i think the least we can be in entering into a dynamic with another person, especially a romantic one, is to at least know which parts of it are our own. but i also know that i place a disproportionate amount of importance on things like “my own” and sometimes that gets in the way of my interpersonal relationships. so. it’s always balance in the end, i suppose. but most importantly, you have no idea how much warmth i felt to hear that you’ve been building your own world. i have faith that if ever you do share it with someone again, it will be on terms more your own than, say, your past relationships have been. but sorry omg you didn’t ask for my thoughts on that, and ofc i only know the parts of the story that you’ve trusted me with here. <br><br>it is a wonderful thing, though, isn’t it? to have so much fullness in the world we call our own, the world we built for ourselves? i think it’s one thing for someone to love you Despite the state of your internal and external world, another for them to love you Because of these, but it’s a different love altogether when the internal and external world are just another part of you, and when someone loves you and enters a relationship with you, you get to give them a little tour of your world and that’s all. you don’t have to compromise who you are. you don’t have to expect them to build the rest of your world for you. bc you’re separate people and the beauty of relationships is that you come together despite that, not the joining of two half-selves into one. so really, truly, i feel a lot of love for your own self-love. thank you for sharing this with me, and for such a lovely message.</div>

 <div class=reply>i think good can be quite subjective in terms of social media apps so i’m only speaking from my own limited experience venturing outside of goodreads — but i myself use storygraph and literal club and i like both for different reasons! both sites also offer a mobile app + direct imports from goodreads, though personally i found that doing it manually allows for a smoother process. i know someone who’s also quite fond of readerly, and though it doesn’t have a big library as of now, i think oku club looks rather nice.</div>

 <div class=reply>not personal at all please no need to apologize !! people have asked me more personal things, i think, and i’ve definitely volunteered even more, and writing’s always gonna be one of those things i’m happy to ping pong thoughts on. with that in mind, i'm running on four hrs of sleep in a day and a half rn and def won't be answering with the eloquence this topic deserves, so i apologize ahead of time 😅<br><br>to answer your much easier second question, i don’t see a life without writing. i think that no matter where i end up, it will always be me and writing. in a way, and as drastic as it sounds, i don’t think there’s a me without writing. i think that for as long as i have a future to live i’ll have to write anything and everything, as you say, bc otherwise i won’t know how to go about life. whether i become an actual author or if i pursue something else, writing will be in my life for as long as i can get to keep it. <br><br>but what inspired me to write the way i do… what do you mean? like, style-wise? bc i always have trouble answering this, and i’m afraid this time isn’t too different. several kind people tell me sometimes that i have a style, but i personally don’t know what it is, let alone where i got it from. i’m sure it’s a hodgepodge of things, and i’m grateful to a lot of media i’ve loved over the years for honing a sense of love for storytelling in me; i really do think i’ve just been incredibly lucky on that front. born hungry and raised lucky, at least. but if you mean what inspired me to really see writing as a thing i can exist with, my ever-evolving answer is that i read the kite runner at like seven years old and that was a literal game changer for the trajectory of my life. it crammed my little kid brain with all the possibilities of a story, and while i don’t know what i’d think of it if i reread it now, but i know that it contains a lot of what i still value above all in my own writing and media consumption so many years later — its character work, its cyclicality, its smallness yet bigness and vice versa. all of it struck me both in the personal and creative sense, and in many respects, i feel unbelievably indebted to the aunt who gifted me that book. possibly at an age that i shouldn’t have been reading it sjdjs but that was definitely a life-defining moment for me.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello !! full honesty i am knocked out, my friend, just absolutely knocked out. a walking carcass. but i do have thoughts about sally rooney and the cwf to share so i’m very glad you asked !!<br><br>re: the upcoming adaptation — i’m a bit conflicted bc i find that adaptations of source material i love never quite end up having magic of their own — the goldfinch movie, the hawkeye tv series, so many things — yet the normal people tv show also has the distinction of doing a lot, lot more for me than the book did, which is currently my least fav rooney. i wonder then how i’ll feel about cwf tv bc the book was strangely one of my more perfect reads in the past few years, not bc the book itself was perfect, but bc reading it felt like living With it for a bit, if that makes sense? i always quote a fav ao3 author of mine in them saying that you don’t quite realize you’ve given over your care to cwf until the end, until it undoes you for reasons you can’t even pinpoint or articulate. that was very much my experience with it as well, and bc i have such affection for the book, i wonder how i’d find the adaptation. i’ve loved all the stills i’ve seen, and i know it’s the same team from np minus sally rooney, so i have hopes, but i am keeping them as low and flexible as possible more to cushion myself than any lack of faith in the people working on the show. <br><br>as for sally rooney, i feel like i answered a cc sometime back about beautiful world, or maybe i’m totally tripping, but i’m having trouble finding it and the gist of it really is that i am more a fan than i am otherwise. i do think she writes for a more specific demographic than the scope of her popularity might suggest, and i’m well-aware i’m not one of the people she writes to, for and about, and while i don’t take that personally myself, i understand people that are turned off from her work for this very reason. lots of people may not feel seen the way that the vast majority of sally rooney’s readers do, and that’s a totally valid critique of a writer who’s been touted as the voice of a generation. i myself don’t necessarily feel seen in her work, but i think you can always tell when an author writes fiction first and foremost from a position of love, and while there’s plenty you can criticize about the scope of praise of her work, love for her own stories is never something i’ll doubt sally rooney of. no matter what, i respect her perspective on writing characters and slice of life stories, and at least for the next little while, i know i’ll consume as much of her work as is available :)</div>

 <div class=question>to preface this weird thought-dump, hi sha! it’s very annoying for me to frame long asks but i like to start with a hi nonetheless.<br><br>i actually haven’t finished first love, late spring in that i skimmed through a lot of stuff that started giving me a stomachache (this is a compliment by the way! things i read do not make me stomachache uncomfortable unless they’re a very specific kind of poignant. and i will absolutely go back and proper read the fic eventually because it was beautiful) but i’d like you to know that megumi and geto’s conversation in chapter 6 is probably the conversation between characters in a fictional story that has stayed the most with me ever. it was like the lenses i had on towards parenting had been smudged as long as i’d been alive, no matter how much i’d adjusted them due to the teachers of age and explanations and my own observations, and that conversation coolly, steadfastly wiped them clean. it sent me into a minor crisis actually, which is again, a great thing! it’s not that i think that something has to truly upset me in order to comfortably hold it in high regard, but that i appreciate things that make me think and feel simultaneously, and that conversation really, really did that. the sort-of continuation of those thoughts in the coda definitely did too, but that part of chapter 6 struck me so hard!<br><br>on another note, i love your huckleberry friend so very much. it never fails to leave me feeling warm and thoughtful even when it might dip me into solemn and gloomy for a paragraph or too, and i love the tangential flow of it, especially because most forms of writing are shoved into being perfectly cohesive and i appreciate things that branch out in all different directions before the formative point is well and truly ingrained in your head a lot! i’ve kind of only just discovered that i can read non-fiction stuff by people who aren’t celebrated academics and published authors and it’s something i find i like a lot, because it feels like my perspective’s been widened :) and i’m sure this will sound trite, but also i love reading your tweets because they make me think too! i’d like to be a person who can say or write things that make people think the way that you do.<br><br>i won’t ramble on with my word-vomit praise any longer, except to say that your itadori in first love, late spring is a MASTERFUL depiction of an so7 (though i’m very fond of so7s, so i’m a bit biased) and that it makes me fantastically happy to know that you thought of his enneagram at least a little going into the story! <br><br>i hope you’re having a good day!</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s been a couple of weeks since you sent this cc, and i don’t know where you stand on flls now, but it’s always a warm kind of surprise when i hear such a specific thing about that chapter 6 scene bc truth be told, i never expected that to be the scene that so universally resonates, it seems? i anticipated yuuji’s desires to have its echoes, and for people to understand where megumi is coming from outside of his own pov chapters, but that geto conversation has taken its own mental and emotional life outside of the context it’s in and it moves me every time to remember that. reminds me in a way that there are plenty of things that might mean something small to me but might be necessary to hear for another person yet to come to that realization, so i guess i understand why people like to shake their fists and say they brought up flls in therapy and in fact take a lot of comfort that there is a sharedness in the humanity of our world and otherwise completely and even doubly fictional characters. so thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with me! <br><br>(feels like i should note that i do think i’m quite jaded when it comes to parenting, and in a way, i’m not at all generous with it, but i also don’t think i should be? so. that must definitely have informed how i talk about it in writing. i don’t pretend to be a well-adjusted authority on it haha) <br><br>god, your cc is so articulate and wonderful and i’m here reeling from daylight savings and not putting the right words together to properly thank you. truly, you’ve been so kind and generous to even my nonfiction — and my tweets ??? omg ?? — and it means a lot as i settle back in from the insanity of the past several weeks. it’s one thing, i always think, to receive sweet words and another cherry on top for it to come with such thoughtfulness and eartnessness about how we can widen the ways we think, so thank you, seriously, for reaching out with this not-at-all-word-vomit little letter. <br><br>if you happen to see this reply, please know that i am wishing you a good spring! and p.s. i have a lot of fondness for 7s myself, second only to my undying love for 8s, so i get you and i’m super thrilled to hear that flls yuuji’s 7ness came through in all the little tropes and details 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>what’s your personal take on yuka’s gender, as explored in the manga? i know it’s set ambiguously considering yuka was in the middle of figuring it out themself, and i’ve seen many different interpretations that i enjoy so i was just wondering about your thoughts !</div>

 <div class=reply>oh whoa… this is tricky to answer bc i think labels and such should inform the experience but not the identity, which in itself is an ever changing relationship you maintain with your self-image and self-expression in a way that affirms the core you. so if you’re looking for what label i want to apply for yuka, then i’m afraid i don’t have a response to that.<br><br>beyond this, the short answer is that in english, i use she / he / they pronouns in as much equal measure as i can when writing and/or talking about yuka.<br><br>the longer version is that sticking to only one of these, particularly she or they, doesn’t really encompass — for me — the relationship yuka has with all the things that go into how they understand their ~gender, and i put the ~ there bc i think conversations around gender can’t be isolated from his overall identity. when we’re talking about yuka’s gender or what pronouns to use for her in english, we’re also talking about the parts of yuka who had to fight from an early age for the right to be his own self, yet they are also caught between ① turning to others as guideposts for her own identity-making, as in the case with japanese art and his grandmother, and how their main source of love becomes conflated with identity and love of their own; ② yuka’s also a lot more reliant than they seem to want to accept on receiving affirmation of their self-image from other people, which we see in multiple instances that yatora tends to misconstrue and once, from yuka’s admission, when talking about her fangirls at school. there’s self-awareness there, but i think where yuka is really struggling is to see dimensions in his own gender, bc she’s very focused on not being “what the world wants me to be” and in the process, i think, compacts a lot of non-compactable things. they want to be defiant to the world, yet they are also reliant on that same world to validate the self she presents to it. and that’s a lot of stuff to navigate on a daily basis, enough that even yatora quietly points out yuka’s tendency to stick to the simplest explanation of an otherwise complex identity. the two of them have that very much in common, and yatora says something simplistic and insensitive when he points out that yuka would be more popular if “you dress like a boy” — and he might be right, which would address the external part of yuka’s self-image, yet it won’t encompass the internal identity and their need to not submit to the world’s norms. so. to me, yuka’s all three pronouns. using she, at least we know, was an attempt to simplify what isn’t simple, and insofar from my own perspective, i still want to address all the remaining parts of yuka that even she has yet to unpack, and also using he and they, at the very least, is the best i have at the moment.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh man this was sent 20+ days ago too am i too late... have you figured it out... it's sometimes the case for types in the same heart / head / body centre to get crossed, and the enneagram institute actually has pages on misidentifications. here's theirs on type 2 vs type 4: https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/misidentifying-2-and-4<br><br>but ultimately i don't know if those types are... too similar... other than being feeling types... so i genuinely wonder what the catalyst for the confusion is? the main thing with any of the types is the primary desire and primary fear. for 2s, a lot of that revolves around needing to be needed and appreciated and validated, meaning that their internality comes from external forces and what they offer to those / to others. type 4s, on the other hand, are very much about self-image and individuality and identity-making, to focus on their own emotional needs, to live in their internal moods and feelings. in all of that, i say external very deliberately for 2s, and internal very deliberately for 4s. <br><br>so. i am quite lost… about where your situation could be. my thoughts are that either you took a quiz that didn't really go super in depth, or... maybe... you're a type 9? have you gotten results for that one at all? sometimes people also like to cross-reference with their mbti, bc there are cases where one enneatype occurs a lot in a certain mbti, but i’m not a big fan of that typology, and won’t necessarily recommend it :/</div>

 <div class=reply>hmmm this is such a good question bc i'm sure there have been plenty to supplement textbook learning but it's hard to think of all of them together, necessarily, unless you had a language in mind? right now, i have rikaikun installed for reading japanese, and for a while, i used to have this extension that broke down netflix japanese subtitles + i once used a site that i can't remember the name of now but it essentially had animes and jdramas with subs optimized for learning. a quick google search tells me animelon is the closest popular one, but the website doesn't look like the one i remember :( <br><br>besides those, i am still subscribed to learn italian with lucrezia on youtube and latintutorial. japanese is really the only language that i don't have anyone to practice it with, plus the only language i encounter a lot that doesn't use the roman alphabet, so it's a bit of a different case in terms of supplementary materials. otherwise, shows like the norwegian series skam and all its remakes in other countries have been very conducive for getting used to the general, colloquial way of speaking in certain languages. really any "foreign language" media has been helpful for me once i was comfortable with what to expect, grammar wise. were you looking for something in particular / a specific language with this question?</div>

 <div class=reply>the side that was on team empath slander + the side that gets kpop fancams + idol tiktoks + the side where the biggest thing on it shaming self-awareness back into me these days are user ejhavingfun’s cool la dad povs + i also get musicals + so many dogs and farm animals + babies + cooking + dancing not in the charli way but in both the bailey sok and nathanlust way + mech keyboards + fashion + little vlogs + lots of quebecois tik toks for some reason + sometimes emily mariko shows up. she’s probably the most followed tiktoker i get. <br><br>but also i tend to slam the not interested button on anything that remotely makes me feel off so in a sense my fyp is more customized than like. my twitter tl.</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha hope it's okay to share this!<br><br>so it's currently 4:51 am in the philippines right now and i just got off from a nearly 4-hour talk with my best friend who's scheduled for a flight to manila in 11 hours. apparently his family's getting the preparations done cause theyre moving to canada :( worst case, permanently :(<br><br>and he also told me to keep this a secret from everyone, my parents and our mutual friends included, and i've been tossing around my bed for hours now cause i can't stop thinking about it. then i remembered for some reason that youre in canada and ended up in your ccs<br><br>ahh i hope it's okay to rant. i'm happy for my friend, but it's only now when he told me that he's moving away that i'm realizing how attached i've actually grown to him. and that, out of my very small social circle, he's the one i'm actually closest to. i really don't want him to go because it'll get really lonely without him and he was one of the only people who knew about my personal problems. i'm trying really really hard to be happy for him, but it just feels like i'm forcing myself<br><br>my fear is that we might lose contact. he's not the kind of person you can get a hold of easily. <br><br>school and life in general has been easier to get by because he was with me. i dont think i can handle it when he's not. ah, it's making me sad. am i being selfish? what do you think?</div>

 <div class=reply>definitely okay !!!!!!! and i’m so sorry for not responding sooner, bc this sounds like a very emotionally heavy moment and it mustn't have been easy to articulate it in a message like this. so thank you for thinking of me and sharing it. i don’t know if i have much to offer you, really, but it’s interesting too bc this was such a visceral cc for me to read? in a way, i was your friend once, too, almost down to every point — i also only told my best friends i was moving from the philippines to canada, told them to keep it secret, and i also happen to not be the kind of person you can get a hold of easily. and it makes me sad, too, to hear it from your perspective, especially bc i always think nowadays how much easier it would be do the leaving rather than be the one left. that’s really hard, bc there’s this thought that he gets to have a life in a place you’ve never been to while you keep on living where he used to be with you. so no, god, i don’t think you’re being selfish at all. i think there’s plenty in this situation to grieve, and i don’t think grieving the loss of your friend necessarily means you don’t also want the best for him in the end. i know that if there was a way, somehow, magically, for him to get to go to canada and for you two to remain as you are, you would still want it for him, right? it just so happens that physics-wise, these are impossible to coexist. and you’re allowed to grieve that impossibility.<br><br>as for that grief, however, as with any time i get messages like this, i’m afraid i don’t really have an antidote to offer. all i can say is that sometimes the complexity of friendships like this and the nature of how you lose them — or anticipate you might lose them — is what makes feeling emotions about them so hard. so don’t be even harder on yourself and think you’re not allowed to feel as you do. it’s a genuine fear that you might lose contact. and i can’t promise you any one thing or another, bc the truth is that we never know what will happen with our friendships, whether or not he stayed in the philippines. and i’m very, very sorry. it’s not often that i feel myself overcome with as much emotion as another person, and i value my own objectivity in a lot of these cases, but i truly do feel for you. and my only note is that you don’t have to be perfectly, completely happy if that’s not something you’re able to give right now. it’s okay if it isn’t, you know? none of it changes, from my standpoint, that i Am at least glad you have a friend so close to your heart that it physically hurts to be happy at the thought of losing them. i think, more than anything, that that’s an incredibly special thing.</div>

 <div class=reply>i absolutely love how this sounds like i also dislike my classics peers… which isn’t entirely wrong. there’s a reason i’m still not in classics grad school and have eloped with the audio industry instead bc the only other option was an arranged marriage with law school. <br><br>that aside, i actually have not read a single mary renault! but i’ve had several profs affectionately mention having read at least a handful of her works, which is both surprising and telling when nearly every contemporary work doesn’t quite engage with the full difficulty of depicting classical antiquity. which — understandable. while i don’t like madeline miller’s work, i also understand that it’s more work to actually depict literally ancient who-even-cares tales with nuances down to the nitty-gritty, and some writers just don’t wanna do that bc really, honestly, they don’t have to. i respect that. what i don’t like is acting like miller’s works are, like, the crescendo of classical retellings. there’s a reason a lot of people winced and braced themselves when she announced her persephone story. <br><br>but i bring that up not just to reiterate those feelings but bc i think mary renault’s work also has its dark sides *precisely* bc they are so much more historically and accurately complex than miller’s output, and that’s why i’ve been conflicted about touching them. for better or for worse, i think engaging with hellenist topics, societies, lifestyles &amp; philosophies with the gravity they require also means you fall into the trap of the realities of the time period you’re depicting — which is pederasty, which is the rigid nature of class and intelligentsia in ancient athens, etc. in this, i guess i prefer renault’s approach, bc i’d rather you depict the world you’re actively choosing to use as a backdrop for your story with the complexity that Should come part and parcel with it + i don’t believe in the fairness of using ancient mythologies and only cherry-picking what will fit the story you want to tell, and while that’s more true for non-western folklore, i still hold madeline miller’s work to the same standard. but at the end of the day, i don’t know if that equates to me choosing renault *over* miller, necessarily. i’ve read one and a half books from the latter; i haven’t read any of the former. i don’t know if that will change any time soon.<br><br>but thank you so much for this q, and it’s definitely got me thinking more about renault!</div>

 <div class=reply>hi !! what a kind way to open your cc with omg <br><br>but ahhh i don’t… really… annotate? i don’t have the personality for it, i think, in the same way i don’t like to outline or research ahead of writing or how i hate travelling with strict itineraries. it’s that same feeling? it ruins the fun, for me? like, i know i’ll get bogged down if i try to force myself to do it, and the entire process will seem suddenly laborious bc of the added effort necessary on my end, if that makes sense. i’m a lazy “act now, reflect later” person, really, and annotations where you just react to the stuff happening or make notes as you’re going along feel to me a very tedious task if only bc i’m so incompatible with it. if i Had to do it for anything, i definitely won’t end up consuming the thing at all.<br><br>that said, i do occasionally highlight if i’m reading on my phone / ereader !! no notes, unfortunately, just highlights. or a screenshot. if i’m reading a paperback and have tabs on hand, i’ll put it on the page, but i don’t underline or highlight the lines with a marker or anything. i admire people who do, they are certainly more organized than i am, but if picking up a pen to note a good line down is already so much work it ruins my laidback fun, then you can imagine just how lazy i am 😅 if i read a thing for something, like maybe for a fic or a video essay, i’ll maybe take screenshots or tab accordingly, but only after reading the full thing through without annotating at all and Then going back to flip through again for what had stood out to me. a lot of that is blind trust in my memory that i’ll remember the scenes that matter when the time comes, some of it is that i just tend to not enjoy anything with preconceived notions or expectations, but the bulk is also conscious work on my part to not be a cliche type 5w4 who thinks and researches more than they do and act. it’s a very destructive habit for me to leave unchecked, i find, to think too much in the act of doing something. sometimes you gotta just get in there and stay present and absolutely nothing else. <br><br>but god what am i going on about to your very simple question — i annotate by way of the occasional highlight, yes. otherwise, no.</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s been a hot minute since you sent this and i’m really genuinely sorry for taking so long to answer — but it’s interesting you ask this bc i was just talking to a friend currently interning at a private psychotherapy clinic and he mentioned that his mentor doesn’t really like cognitive behavioural therapy bc their clinic tends to get the people for whom cbt didn’t work. and in reply, i said that i only ended up in cbt *bc* counselling wasn’t working for me At All, and to this day cbt has By Far done the most work for me. <br><br>that said, i realize i’m also assuming that by counselling you mean essentially talk therapy / having someone to talk through problems with you vs cbt, dbt, etc. the short answer to that is if one didn’t work for you, i’d encourage you to try the other. however, if i’m not understanding you right, and that in fact your question is whether a mental health specialist would be different from uni counselling — then yes, easily, absolutely. though with that in mind, therapy can at times feel trial and error. some people will find that it works for them, others will find it doesn’t, period, or that maybe it does but just not with this particular therapist. but if the q is whether you should discount therapy altogether just bc uni counselling wasn’t helpful — then no, i don’t think so. i believe you should give it an earnest shot, see how you feel. <br><br>now. i don’t currently receive mental healthcare in the gta. so take all of this with a grain of salt. but places to start might be: camh on queen street offers drop-in counselling, among other programs, as does stella’s place. for both places, i believe you can refer yourself. this is what i did to force my way into the system; referred myself, did drop-in, told the person who spoke to me everything going on and what kind of help i’d like, and from there, i jumped from program to program. another avenue in is to call a mental health hotline, and be transparent with what you need — like, hey, uni counselling didn’t work for me, is there any way i can do this or that. chances are they’ll also recommend drop-in counselling to you, but there’s still a chance they’ll refer you themselves. <br><br>and listen. i know what u mean about the handouts thing. it took a lot of looking to get myself into the system, but once you’re in, at least for me, it was referral to referral, which went much more smoothly. so i know it’s daunting, but if you’re seeking help, i promise the road might get bumpy, but it will lead somewhere if you stick with it. <br><br>if you have qs or anything else i can answer, or if you feel anxiety about the process and want to know what it’s like ahead of time, then i’m more than happy to share my experience. just drop by. i’ll do my best not to take another month to answer. okay? best of luck, and sending u a fistbump for reaching out on this.</div>

 <div class=question>i really think i should first and foremost thank you for your response 🫂 i know this isn’t only valid to my ask (but to all ccs you get), but the kindness and dedication you put in them all is so admiring. you carefully craft your replies and i agree with the anon that doesn’t believe how they have access to your words for free in a world run by money.<br><br>i really think you have a point in saying that the “problem” with childhood friends to lovers trope is, to sum it up, conceiving time to be equal to trust and understanding. thinking that way seems to sustain that relationships built later in the life of a person will never have the same affection and history as the relationships born in their earlier years do. history between people does not equal to love, i think that’s what it comes down to. like you said, it’s unfair to neglect all of the voluntary attention paid to the one you love. i also like the part you say “and i also have faith that even if they met farther down the line, iwaizumi would still remain at his core the kind of person who can see through oikawa’s layers”—at first glance this could look like an attempt to characterize them as soulmates who would have ended up together, one way or another, by fate. but then again it’s a disservice to reduce them both and neglect their work of loving each other to just How Things Are Fatally Supposed To Be. and looking at it now, it seems to me that both tropes you’re not very fond of (childhood friends to lovers &amp; soulmates) are characteristic of not recognizing relationships and love as being built again and again by choice, essentially. it’s easy to construct a relationship between characters when all the work that realistically needs to be done for it to work is simply assigned to inherent factors or divine forces.</div>

 <div class=reply>OH YOU’RE SO RIGHT ABOUT MY PREFERENCES IN TROPES REFLECTING MY OWN PERSPECTIVES ON LOVE… no wonder i feel so much for the exes trope. but that’s a tangent waiting to happen. <br><br>and yes !! again, i think that really is all it comes down to, and not the tropes in themselves. i still absolutely believe soulmates and childhood friends to lovers can be done well, and i myself have liked exceptions to my general avoidance of them. it’s really not the trope so much as how it tends to give people justification for not dedicating As Much time to cultivating the… nature of the love there? so to speak? but i think we covered that in our last convo and in your wonderful response here 🤍<br><br>thank you so much for your kind words about my ccs (i do think i’m def slacking off lately in giving these both the mind and heart each deserve tbh) and thank you so much for wording your own thoughts on My thoughts so beautifully. it’s really the most i can ask for in, like, an anon one-on-one platform like this, so thank you for taking the time to not only respond but to do it so thoughtfully. it seriously means a lot. if you end up catching this response despite how long it’s been since you left it, then i hope you’ve been well. take care, and happy spring !!</div>

 <div class=question>Hi Sha, I hope you're in good condition these days.<br>I'm sorry if I come to you to ask for guidance, tips, or advice, but I think that it's really amazing how we're not really that far in age (I'm certainly younger than you, I think) but your words and thoughts helped me untangle the things in my crowded mind like no one and I mean this very seriously<br><br>The thing is I want to ask how do you tell yourself to do something you're obliged to but you feel like dying inside because you don't really want to do it? Because you know doing it might shake something in your core, that the thought of it makes you think that you're terrified of it? But you know you're not terrified of it, or not really - It's just - maybe you just feel it's painful in a way that you can't really articulate, although you know you can handle it? Like you know you can get used to the pain and all that because you have no other choice?<br><br>I'm sorry if the question bothers you in the most unpleasant way, and feel free to just back away and tell me to get help somewhere else tbh, and I'd still thank you for taking the time to answer this heheh</div>

 <div class=reply>so… okay. first off, i’m very Very sorry that your q coincided with me tapping out of twitter for a bit. it gets a bit overwhelming being expected to have helpful guidance when i’m also just another twenty-year-old who also has to untangle these things for myself in attempting to do so for others, and that’s very emotionally draining sometimes, you know? but i say that as an apology for taking a while to get to you and not bc i’m wringing my hands and asking how dare u !! bc i do love the thoughts these generate, and it’s not ur fault. if anything, thank u so so much for being so kind and understanding in your cc. it’s rarer these days that someone takes the time. and i’m glad, still, that i can be trusted with this, and i do want to try my best to answer. <br><br>but ahhh what a question to start me off on as i hop back onto cc. i don’t know if i’m much help now, a month late in answering, but i guess my thoughts are… what’s obliging you to do it? bc dying inside is a super intense pain to be feeling over smth ur merely tied to via obligation, if you know what i mean? yet u also say ur not terrified of it, that u can handle it, which reassures me a little… but still. i’m concerned that by handling it u mean that you’ll just grit ur teeth through the pain. and i don’t really want that for u, either, sweet stranger. <br><br>if u want my normal human being answer — if u absolutely, Absolutely must have to do it, and u know it will be over at some point as long as u fulfill your ~obligation, then honestly, i’m a rip the bandaid off kind of guy myself :/ if it’s smth i can’t escape or negotiate or navigate, then the more terrifying, the more quickly i dive right into it. a social worker told me once that for better or for worse, the body can only sustain real peak anxiety and fear for only so long, and eventually, it will adjust, adapt. so with that in mind, i get myself through the hardest parts, the beginning, and wait for myself to adapt. <br><br>my responsible older sibling answer, however, you shouldn’t have to give up your boundaries and your own comfort in the name of someone else’s, and especially not in the name of smth as flimsy and ultimately functionless as “obligation.” who u are and what u feel is more important than smth someone said u have to do bc — bc what? when we say obligation, it’s rare that they actually have an answer to that. it’s always, “just because.” and i find that insufficient when it’s causing u so much pain. u shouldn’t have to put up with that “just because.” <br><br>i’m afraid i can’t offer much without any specifics at all, bc from ur description it can be anything from having to attend a family event with people who cause u grief or helping someone hide a body. but i’m sure it’s not the latter, and whatever it is, i wish you all the best. i truly hope things work(ed) out for you.</div>

 <div class=reply>i… mentioned it a few replies ago? not that i’m doubting! just that it’s been so long since i watched link click that it feels like waking up from a long vivid dream and finding out i was sleeptalking about it. or maybe i just need to take a break from replying to ccs. <br><br>but ahhh fav character is cxs, easily! protagonists like him tend to be the deal-breaker between me and a series, in the sense that often main characters who are earnest and are serial do-gooders to a fault tend to be treated by the narrative as naive, ultimately helpless to save the people they want to save, or like it’s necessary to give them a harsh lesson of how “real life” works — which is not what i’m here for if you’re going to have a central character like that in the first place. so it was such a wonderful surprise that cxs is kind and brash and a bit naive, yes, but he’s also very angry and capable of pulling through with his own stubbornness, that he had his own strengths beyond just being The Good-hearted Character. i appreciated that lu guang wasn’t necessarily a foil to him so much as a guide, and that yes, he’s often like, “come on. let’s be real here.” about all sorts of things, but he’s also malleable about his own values in the same ways that cxs is. and that might be why i was so invested from the end of the emma case onwards, bc it’s so rare to have a story with characters i don’t have to worry about at all. i had all this space to lose my mind over the plot without worrying about what lg and cxs were up to. if that makes sense. <br><br>i just have a lot of affection for how balanced link click is, i think. there’s heart and grit in equal measure, there’s as much to love about the characters as there was about the plot to earn your investment even when you don’t think you cared that much quite yet, and what really impressed me most was how deftly it navigated sci-fi fantastical elements with these everyday human motivations you might see on modern love. the sentiment is laid on thick sometimes, sure, but it’s never Too thick, and there are always consequences and conflict and tension. and to be able to keep that balanced without teetering for a whole season? it was such a good viewing experience.<br><br>running out of space but the case that surprised me was the 5.5 special, with the dojo. i thought it was going to be just a quick one-off, a breather, so i didn’t anticipate it having a reveal and when it came, i was so startled i cried oops but all in all, my fav case has to be the basketball game! maybe bc that’s technically the one we spent the most time with, but it was also the twist that i really felt alongside cxs instead of just as a horrified / saddened viewer, and the one where my emotions were Tuned in as much as it could be.</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t think i’ve talked in depth about it on here! but really amazing timing bc not too long ago i was talking to someone via dms about adam &amp; gansey and it unearthed all these thoughts i didn’t realize i had in me to articulate about the series. i’ve always been sure i loved it, but it’s another to know that at 18 and another to know it as i am now, with the thought processes i have? but with that in mind, i think trc is best consumed as all vibes and not much else.. haha… it’s the series that made me realize i didn’t care about plot as much as i did about characters, bc those books have absolutely nothing impressive to offer with substance in terms of plot and cohesive narrative, but i adore it anyway bc it made up for it with characters who had so much going on. you know how people say they love books with plots that have Something Going On? in trc, the characters Were what was going on. at least to me. i think all of them are complicated in ways i found thrilling and exciting bc there were never any easy answers. all of them are terrible and Trying Their Best and straightforward and thorny and i could not give any less of a shit about where the plot was going. a red flag for me is a trc reader who flattens all these characters in any way, whether for better or for worse, bc every single one of them had terribleness that pulsed so alive underneath all the genuine love they all had for each other and what they dreamed of. every single one. from the gansey and the gang down to henry to blue’s family to the lynch brothers. every. single. one.<br><br>as for more specific favs, adam means a lot to me bc he was the first character to really represent and embody my own childhood, background and, consequently, my approach to life? perspective? worldview? not to get too personal. but without that, i think i’m still very much the most easily similar to gansey, with a sprinkle of blue. my fav dynamics are adam &amp; gansey’s, in all the complicatedness of that, and more harmlessly, the sarchengsey trio. some stray thoughts: my fav book is bllb. i know so many fragmentary quotes by heart and likely always will. i loathe the embarrassingly awful latin and do not care for mstief’s excuse. i wish the antagonists didn’t change every book. i’ll probably think of tdt differently if i reread it now. trk disappointed me a lot. i think the ending reveal &amp; solution was bs. it didn’t need a sequel trilogy. i wish we got more of the whole group together. oh, how i loved them all. <br><br>i’m a little loopy and disorganized after answering a handful of ccs in succession, but tysm for this q and in retrospect, i really, really hope you meant the raven cycle or else i am very embarrassed and will redo this answer.</div>

 <div class=question>"if you feel like the mark had been missed bc the book didn’t really deliver on them, period, or bc the delivery itself wasn’t good"<br>is it possible to say both? because i like to give authors grace in the sense that i could tell what the author thought she was doing but the ideas did not feel fleshed out (despite the length) nor were their full potential reached. in response to some criticisms, i've seen the author say 'well this is the first book in the duology/ possible triology" but i don't think thats a great response when even the world building is poor? Us not learning much about the society beyond whats in the intro is acceptable, but the world itself we learn about magical unis, magic world is separate from non magic world... and thats about it. The Society where they're at for majority of the book creates such an insular world for them that I expected more from their dynamics beyond faux deep conversations (you mentioned in your other response about how academia can foster found family-type relationships... me saying they're friendly would be stretching it) . and well for the academia part, i will say it succeeds in dropping a good amount of academic jargon in regards to time manipulation and such lol. <br>tl/dr did not deliver on world building, what it means for knowledge to be held by the power that is britain, and just characters that are beyond archetypes. delivered poorly on character dynamics and everything else. <br> <br>megumi being asked/required to return sukuna's body to its original state is such a wow idea especially because i assume sukuna is evil in this au as well. and the deity thing probably explains why yuujis area of study was on religious cults (if i remember correctly)? i think the commentaries you mentioned would've been very insightful and not melodramatic at all, and somehow it reminds me of Mahito's column in flls.... the connection is clear in my mind but i'm unable to put it in words. something along the lines of how love for some can mean consumption of the other, and how fanaticism allows for the consumption of self to give room for something More than. Not sure if that makes much sense but yeah. from your response i'm able to glean more what this au looks like and!!! the image of maki in a burning zenin estate (esp w how she looks now) your mind sha...</div>

 <div class=reply>I GASPED AT THIS. YOU WENT FULL IN WITH THE CRITIQUE AND I LOVE IT. it would have been so easy for you to say “all flair, no substance” or something along those lines but the fact that you took the time to break down the diff areas and how exactly the book failed to deliver — i love, love, love it and i appreciate the thought and care you put into this so, so much. again, i haven’t finished it, nor do i feel enthused enough to do so any time soon, but i am with you one hundred percent on this being the first book in a series not being a good excuse for failing to deliver on worldbuilding. and it’s such a shame to hear they don’t get into real connections between the six when one of the main parts i was looking forward to is how they’re all, for the first time, with people technically their ~equals and who can give as much as they get by way of going beneath surface level. i thought we were getting a taste of that with nico &amp; libby in the beginning, but ahhh i guess the faux deep runs deeper than just the prose, huh. damn. it’s a different kind of disappointment when — it sounds like — a book is more obsessed with making itself than the story it’s telling to get there. <br><br>and tysm for the warm response on the hiuh recap :( but also your memory is stellar, oh my god? yes, yuuji’s area of study was on religious cults, and ofc he was not so sneakily researching his own in particular. and gosh, you remember mahito’s column better than i do. but no, def the connection is there somewhere, probably bc so much of jjk for me is about how the way we love the things we love backfire on us, and it’s one thing to have that within familial and romantic relationships in flls, but it’s another thing for love to be weaponized in more ways than one. or how We are weaponized by how people have loved or failed to love us. hence maki burning down the zenin estate at the end. ahhhh it’s such a shame i’ll never get to write it atp bc the visual is so clear in mind. but thank you so much for Your beautiful mind. this + ta6 has been such a joy to talk about.</div>

 <div class=reply>no, no, omg, you’re good, and it’s a completely valid question! (very observant, too, for you to recall this! i really appreciate the attentiveness.) i think the specific thing about iwaoi — and any pairing i like who might also happen to be childhood friends — is that even if you remove that one trope from the equation, it won’t change what’s good about their dynamic? at least to me? the thing that i hate about tropes is that so many people rest the foundation of everything in a relationship on what those tropes offer, when to me, and especially true for iwaoi, it’s not that they happened to catch bugs together as kids and have played volleyball together for as long as they have that make the dynamic what it is. it’s not that iwaizumi probably knows oikawa’s family and vice versa that makes them who they are to each other. it’s not the length of time they’ve known each other but how they have chosen to know each other and all the things inherent to who they are as individual people that make iwaoi the pairing that they are to me. i think too often, childhood friends to lovers romance convince us of a romantic partner’s viability for a character’s love purely bc they’ve known them since childhood and we are supposed to assume some level of special, irreplaceable closeness from that. when in fact you can spend a lifetime with someone and still not know them as well as iwaoi know each other. and i also have faith that even if they met farther down the line, iwaizumi would still remain at his core the kind of person who can see through oikawa’s layers. we know bc it’s not like they were childhood friends with matsukawa and hanamaki, too, and yet they both have their own nuanced understanding of who oikawa is. so i think, it’s not that i don’t like childhood friends to lovers for what it is, but i hate the assumption that childhood friends automatically means a specific knowability in the dynamic when even that has to be earned. tsukiyama earned being on equal standing with each other, for example, and while i don’t love the pairing romantically, one of my fav hq scenes will always be the “what more do you need than pride?” moment. or, like, if we really think about it, kunimi &amp; kindaichi knew kageyama longer than hinata, but does that equal knowing who that person is deep inside? my issue isn’t with childhood friends being seen as romantic. my issue is that it is Automatically seen as romantic when the friendships you make as a young person are some of the most human, complicated and un-romantic relationships you ever form. and i think it’s a disservice to iwaizumi, who remains one of the most perceptive people in the series, to be reduced to “oh, he knows oikawa as well as he does bc they grew up with each other.” like, yes, but he’s also genuinely done the work to pay attention. <br><br>but anyway. again. so much to get into and tropes very hardly do more than scratch the surface sometimes.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello again! thank you so much for thinking of flls as a go-to for something profound, but i am very sorry to hear you’ve been feeling down. i empathize completely with wanting to read a specific thing when your emotions are at a certain place, though, and while my thoughts are that no, it isn’t bad at all, especially if you feel like there’s something there that might make you feel better + i also know there’s catharsis to be found in wallowing in the sadness of something else than what it is you’re feeling, i’d also hate to hear flls has only made you feel worse. so i think… maybe just read through certain sections? and get a feel of where you’re at? i think it’s a huge undertaking to reread the whole thing + the coda, if ever, and my main thing is that if you feel it will be escapist or cathartic, then please, by all means. but if you feel like it might introduce things to your current headspace that you’ll be healthier without, then i suggest passing on re-reading flls for now, okay? sending you all the warmth and well wishes possible. i really, really hope the rest of the month treats you more kindly.</div>

 <div class=question>i’m so happy to find another hater of a little life 🫂 i was willing to give it try because i figured that there /must/ by something redeeming about it for it to be so widely beloved but i can’t for the life of me see what everyone else sees i am forever bewildered by the overwhelming amount of praise hanya and her novels receive i think the thing that unsettles me the most is how gratuitously she writes about such delicate topics with no hope or empathy or consideration it unsettles me that a novel that preaches nothing but pain and loneliness and hopelessness is being hailed as the “great gay novel”</div>

 <div class=reply>OOF honestly it’s been so much more validating for me to see how many people have also been nursing a secret hatred of a little life bc irl i feel like i’ve just been completely inundated by people loving it. not just liking it, but Loving it. bc no, absolutely, you said it so well with the last few clauses in your message! i’ve always wondered if maybe i was being too twee or sentimental in asking for delicacy in writing about something as awful and thorn-riddled as trauma, but… it’s not even the lack of hope at the end that unsettles so much as, like you said, the gratuitous way she writes about these topics that no one in their right mind should be using as a vehicle for Indulging, of all things. i think there was a point in the beginning portion of the book where i did get the sense that it was writing about trauma in a way that made me feel like i was seeing a realistic, even-handed description of it, but then it goes way off the rails and seems to delight in doing so. and beyond that, i think my personal anger is also just rooted in how people who read it conflate this feeling of being overwhelmed with having genuine human emotions that a story takes time and care to earn, you know? i’ve always figured hey, maybe i just don’t have the experience of a gay man finding himself in this story. and maybe that’s still true. but. i just don’t want to conceive of the great queer experience as one that, supposedly at its best, is treated in writing with what people are trying to tell me is love but to me just reads as the glee of a spectator.</div>

 <div class=reply>my brain started overheating trying to formulate an answer to this that won’t be a party pooper, but i… honestly don’t have anything. and not in the sad, “god, i have nothing to live for” way bc that’s a different Bleh vibe altogether, but just in the… i’m taking it one moment at a time, you know? i’ve kind of conditioned myself in the past year to not get excited or too ahead of myself about things bc it never works out for me, which is So edgy to type out but i just mean that… there’s no use, with who i am and my emotional constituion and the state of my life, to get caught up looking ahead to things. for better or for worse, it’s me and the day i wake up to, and whether as a side effect of all the chemicals keeping me chill or bc this is simply the worldview i have now, it’s the approach that works best for me. kinda like writing. and cooking. let’s take it easy, letting the brush run is all that’s left, all of those philosophies. so really, truly, i’m sorry but i have just — zero. nothing i’m excited for. there Are things where i sometimes go, “oh, yeah, this will come around at some point and it might make that particular day different.” like the next chapter of the current blue period arc, or the various anime adaptations coming out this year of mangas i like, or how i’m getting into the swing of things with my current work projects. but it’s more like an awareness than an excitement, and i promise it’s not a bad thing. it just felt disingenuous to answer your question saying i’m excited for this or that when it’s such a specific adjective and i know i’m not actually Excited excited. so i’m really sorry if this isn’t the answer your sincerely sweet question was expecting, but. this is the most honest i can be right now.</div>

 <div class=reply>this is Such a good question bc i don’t think i’ve spent enough time thinking about tropes. i pull them in and discard them depending on whether they serve what i’m writing, which isn’t very fair considering that despite tropes being tropes, there’s still a lot to unpack in them innately. that said, within fic specifically, i am not a big fan of soulmates? and as an extension of that, i am also not a big fan of unrequited love tropes. so — hanahaki, red string of fate, soulmate marks. it’s all a hard pass for me. on the simplest level, i’m just not interested in how most fics tend to handle them, but more broadly, i think i am just very turned off by the sentiments that fuel that trope. which isn’t to say that i don’t see why people are magnetized towards that! i saw someone say once that people like soulmate aus bc they like the idea that someone could be with them and them alone despite their flaws, but as a person and not just as a writer / whatever i am, i have my own views on that exact dynamic, as well as my own views re: a relationship you are “fated” for, and it just happens to clash with what soulmate aus are built upon. but also that’s just me overthinking otherwise harmless things.<br><br>beyond fic, and even though i did write a childhood friends au, i’m not the most charmed by childhood friends to lovers romances. again, though, it’s just my own thoughts and conceptualizations that make me go hmm about them. and honestly, this is such a broad q and i could go on forever about different ones, ranging from innocent tropes that i just don’t care for in themselves — troublemaker / do-gooder, secret identities, city person / country person, unrelenting sunshine character / someone with A Past — for various reasons, to genuinely harmful tropes like a bisexual character sleeping around a lot, or a bully turning out to be secretly gay, etc. but all in all, and for the purpose of this cc, the ones i know i have strong feelings about, period, are soulmates and childhood friends.</div>

 <div class=reply>NOT TO BE TOO MUCH OF AN ENNEAGRAM ENTHUSIAST BUT THIS MADE ME SMILE BC “SHOULD I BE WORRIED? I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE WORRIED” IS SUCH A TYPE 6 RESPONSE TO BEING A TYPE 6. but i’m glad to hear you checked it out! to be fully honest with you i think any enneagram type has a section that gets into hmm should i be worried territory, but i don’t believe any type in itself is, like, an immediate universal red flag. for me, enneagram types just kind of pinpoint all the strengths and desires and fears and weaknesses of an individual, and that’s really all it is — a guide to examine why your instincts are what they are, what might contribute to that, what you doubt and what you’ll have an easier time believing. things like that. being a type 6, to put it rather simplistically, is really just being a person marked by more skepticism and doubt than, say, other people whose interiority might focus on other things. your relationship with the world is marked by a desire for security, maybe, or you fixate on concrete results that you can trust bc that’s the part of the world that feels the most real to you. maybe you want to interrogate and pick apart something just to see if it will still hold up after you’re done doing that. but i’m also far from being an expert on these things, and whenever someone finds out their type for the first time, i always just point them to the direction of the sleeping at last podcast. it has an episode on each of the types, and they have an actual expert on there to break down the types in a way that feels, i’d say, a lot less clinical than the enneagram institute’s description, for example. for me, the enneagram is a very personal typology, and very human for better or for worse, so. seriously. there’s no such thing as Man Am I Defective For This Being My Type. though i understand the type 6 instinct to be like, crap, this sounds bad. <br><br>but anyway. i’m very, very glad to hear my response soothed you if even a little, and i am cheering you on !!!!!! just spew whatever !!! editing can come later !!!!!</div>

 <div class=reply>might also be that it’s 2am where i am and i’m sleep-deprived as hell but i swear to you this message made me tear up. specifically at the part where you said, “i can’t believe that in a world run by money i get to have access to your rantings and thoughts and writing for free.” bc oh my god, how did you even come up with that? and how was i not supposed to get choked up altogether with those last two lines? god. but seriously, seriously, Seriously, thank you for reading my laurel hell rant, thank you for reading every single thing you have, and i’m glad my points made sense? or at least enough that i feel like yes. i have been understood by you through our shared love for mitski’s music. which is such a wonderful sentiment that no words will do justice. i’ve been listening to the album so much more as well and should’ve been me is definitely creeping higher. it knocks my heart out of my chest every time. <br><br>again, thank you so, so, so unbelievably much for all your kind words, and for not only sparing a thought my way re: the new mitski album but also responding to my response. i wish you a kind week ahead and more ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>hi Sha, i hope you're doing good! i found out about your fics recently and they have me in a chokehold, i swear... i just can't stop thinking about them. later i found out about your twitter and your newsletters and i'm just so. in love with your brain, i guess? idk, i'm currently in a weirder than usual period of my life, undergoing therapy and just overall being the dramatic 4w5 i am (something is lacking, no one will ever understand me etc lmao). i feel like i've been searching for an author like you my whole life and it makes me so happy that we happen to like the same stuff (jjk, blue period especially - btw i obsessed your characterization of murai, i've been thinking about him so much this past week). i really love how you can put your thoughts and feelings into words and it amazes me how you can translate all that in such poetic way. finding you during this confusing life period has been helping me a lot, cause i feel like although i have a lot bubbling up inside, i haven't been very creative, so it feels like i'm releasing all these feelings that are so tight inside my chest when i read something that you wrote. i just wanted to thank you for sharing your words.<br><br>that said, i have some random questions: what's your favorite mitski song? do you have any tips for learning english? what are your favorite books of all time? anything you wanna share about your day or any words of wisdom?</div>

 <div class=reply>i know this sounds a bit too forward, but the only way i know to verbalize how this cc made me feel is that if i could grip your hand in person and give it a good squeeze and shake, i would. i love how well you distilled being a 4w5 there, that made me smile so, so much — not that i’m happy about your current situation in life, not at all, but it gives me this specific warmth when someone talks with such acuity about their enneagram type. but truly, i’m sorry that it’s been rough for you lately, and it’s both sobering &amp; moving to hear that i could provide some sort of catharsis or even just a sense of completion to an otherwise unkind daily situation. there’s lots of cheesy things i can say about how the best reward a writer can have is to know there’s another real person on the other end of something i wrote — but i’ll spare us from making that into a tangent. please have my gratitude for taking the time and space to share your thoughts with me so thoughtfully and gently; there aren’t enough words for your generosity towards the nonsense i do with my words. <br><br>and i love random qs! my fav mitski song atm is two slow dancers, but my fav album is bury me in makeout creek. my tip for learning any language is to watch a reality show / vlogger who uses it a lot + read gradually more complicated literature to build up vocab + a trick that a prof threw me into once that really helped is reading articles about daily world happenings that everyone kind of knows the gist of, except all of it is in the language i’m learning. also, handwriting helps more than simply reading / listening / memorizing vocab, so handwrite as much as you can! my fav books of all time in this current stage of my life are the kite runner by khaled hosseini, which is the first book i ever fell in love with my whole life, when i was 6; the goldfinch, which is the second, when i was 16; and the heart’s invisible furies, which is the fourth, when i was 20. all three have rerouted my relationship with storytelling, no exaggeration. and anything i wanna share about my day… not the happiest thought but i feel really drained today about how i can’t take bad feelings away from the people i love. which sounds simplistic and naive, but sometimes, i wish it was as easy as putting words to a thought &amp; emotion to just whoosh away someone else’s burdens altogether, you know? i wish words alone could be solutions. as for any words of wisdom… hmm. in honour of the new mitski album: sometimes hardening up is the only choice we have to stay soft. <br><br>again, thank you so much for dropping by and for sharing your thoughts with me so mindfully. i wish you a kinder february, and sending you warmth and love 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>hi! and oh my god, i should really, really start keeping better track of things i like so that i’m not constantly blanking when i get questions like these. unfortunately, i’m very disorganized about cataloguing the stuff i’ve consumed — and i do prefer it that way — and there are too-Too many to have just top favourite articles of all time, you know? but off the top of my head, right here, right now: <br><br>· hanya’s boys by andrea long chu, which i admit stokes some personal anger in me, but it’s still a thoroughly well-researched and well-approached piece: https://www.vulture.com/article/hanya-yanagihara-review.html<br><br>· ugly, bitter and true by suzanne rivecca, which is a massive read that deals with some sensitive mental health topics, but i think about it every time i find myself asking if my thoughts deserve to be lengthy https://longreads.com/2018/09/27/ugly-bitter-and-true/<br><br>· against catharsis: writing is not therapy by t. kira madden, which is still not something i feel like i’ve cemented my response / reaction / thoughts about, but definitely something i want to sit down with at some point https://lithub.com/against-catharsis-writing-is-not-therapy/</div>

 <div class=question>same anon here! <br>i feel like not liking atlas six would be an understatement on how i felt about it. i almost immediately went to the authors interviews regarding certain choices to see if i could be swayed and i just couldn't... the night i finished i almost dmed you despite my shyness before i remembered that cc was back online lol<br>i think in theory it had a great idea, a secret magic society and a few who are trusted with immense knowledge. i wanted to know if you'd finished it because well, the beginning chapters do make one think mysterious and intriguing... but thats about it. i remember discussing with a friend that i didn't understand how 9000 words of a fic had been able to set up something that left me starving for more with the dynamics and world while an almost 400 page novel felt flat (this isn't to put you in some awkward position! it was because i read the book because of the fic that i mentioned it). And I love that you mention Callums subversion of empath abilities because that was something I was loving until i was 200 pages in and could see that the mark that had been missed (something i felt with all the characters).<br>t risk of sounding way too bitter— which i fear i've already done— perhaps the edited version will be something better especially with the pretentiousness of the characters.<br><br>i dont really review books so i apologize if the things i said didn't make sense (and i also didn't want to spoil)<br><br>if you ever wanted to share tidbits on what the jjk au could have looked like that would be amazing. there's just something about the way you capture yuuji and megumi that even though i'm no longer in the fandom or invested in the manga, that keeps me coming back to your work.</div>

 <div class=reply>no, please don’t apologize, i love this so much! fwiw, you echo a lot of the thoughts i’ve heard, particularly on the book not really cashing in much of what the premise promises. i read around until the chapter where nico tells gideon he’s going away — which isn’t much at all, i realize now, but it brought up a lot of thoughts that i had to write away, so it’s a specific kind of disappointing when i unpacked my own ideas first bc i wanted to see what the book eventually did with them. i think maybe i’ll still read the non self-published version when it comes out? or maybe wait until the second one is released and see what the conversation around it is saying. but thank you for sharing your honest thoughts, i seriously appreciate it. the general sentiment seems to be that the book’s beauty is mostly fluff and pretension / telling without earnest showing, and that’s really rough to me. i do want to ask, though, and only if you’re okay sharing, if you feel like the mark had been missed bc the book didn’t really deliver on them, period, or bc the delivery itself wasn’t good?<br><br>all that said, thank you so, so much for your kind words on my writing — and ohh i’d actually love to talk about hiuh! i don’t tend to know what happens between two points in a story before completing it, so a lot of this is present me’s conjecture regarding past me’s thoughts, but the main concept was that there’s a secluded, exclusive school meant to cultivate certain rare magic research / abilities, and by the entry point into the story, the first year trio are sort of trying to renew their contract so they get to stay. we know that they’re cloaked from the outside world, &amp; we know that megumi’s shadow work has the ability to, i guess, refresh something into a previous state. from the first chapter, we also know that there’s some shady stuff in yuuji’s past, and the higher-ups want him offed. the idea was that he’s actually in the school bc he’s meant to be the next host for some deteriorated deity — sukuna — once he comes of age. he ran away before the school could turn him in. supposedly. and past me wanted to somehow go from there to yuuji getting megumi captured in his place bc he can “fix” sukuna’s old body, hence no need for a new host, only for it to also be revealed that megumi and nobara were in on it and they all have a plan. one of my ideal final scenes is also maki burning down the zenin estate, for reasons i now can’t remember. insert commentary somewhere in between all that re: privileged, insular societies, the danger of fanaticism and hoarding of knowledge, and how gifted people can be dehumanized for the very value society sees in them, etc. very melodramatic turn of events, i know, and i eventually decided my ~style can’t do it justice, but really, tysm for the interest you so generously show to this au.</div>

 <div class=reply>RIGHT !!! RIGHT??? THAT’S WHAT I’M SAYING. yotasuke is also a type 5, but i think his manifests more in defining himself through the intuitiveness of his competence in art bc it arms him against the external world, and that’s why it shatters him so much when he finds out about the centre exam thing. whereas haruka seems to be a little bit in denial about how much more he thrives in art when he’s consuming and observing it, bc partaking in it reflects — for him — a perceived lack on his part. bc it’s always easier to be a competent observer than an incompetent participant. you don’t get type 5 representation more damning than that.</div>

 <div class=question>do you have a favorite mundane/routine thing to do (such as washing the dishes, organizing a room, grocery shopping, doing laundry etc.)?</div>

 <div class=reply>funnily enough, every single example you listed there is a favourite of mine, omg. maybe dish-washing not so much as the others, but i will still choose it without a thought over other domestic tasks. i think i’m both a restless and indoors-y person, so i’m very guilty of over-organizing and overarranging my living spaces, and laundry’s just one of those things that no one else i live with seems to have the same knack for, and i appreciate having that one mundane task that only i get to do. but i like any repetitive task that allows me to let my mind wander, whether it’s filling up a row of a hundred gift bags with party favors or folding freshly washed clothes or painting walls. but actually, the more i think about it, the more i realize that the mundane thing i love to do most might be building furniture. i Love building furniture, whether ikea ones or from scratch. i love screws and allen keys and paint rollers and sawing and sanding wood. i love going to home depot. i love any excuse to woodwork. i love watching something come together. wow, this is really unlocking some deep-seated love i didn’t even realizing i was carrying so much of, god. but no, i really do think my real top answer is building furniture, if that counts as a mundane task for all its repetitive little steps. the amount of podcasts i get to listen to, how i’m unreachable to the world for however many minutes or hours it takes to finish, having to move around a piece of furniture to paint it or check its durability. i love it a lot. i can’t wait to have my own tiny place and just build so much stuff for it.</div>

 <div class=question>First of all I'm really sorry I'm not good with greetings except uhhhhh hi there<br><br>Lately I've been losing my voice in writing.

Have you ever experienced that?<br><br>At first, I thought all I needed was just fuel my brain again, so I read.

 <div class=reply>oh, man. i know how difficult it is to switch to something you haven’t written before, bc more often than not, you shed the comfort you had already worked hard to cement in the previous media you were writing for, and it feels a lot like starting from scratch, and that you’re “losing your voice” bc you’re going back to zero. so, yes, i Have experienced that, and it really is a tricky, burdensome thing to navigate. but if i’m going to be super, super honest with you, and i promise i’m not trying to invalidate your valid concern — i don’t think there’s such a thing as really losing your voice. i think the “voice” in writing is a myth, and that when you feel like you lose it, you’re losing something else instead: complete knowledge of a character, or maybe you trip up the flow and momentum you had, or suddenly things aren’t clicking as easily as they used to. and to me, those are all perfectly normal things to encounter at some point while writing and you shouldn’t treat them as a sign that your writing is getting worse. it’s not. it’s just at a point of transition, and therefore of growth. that’s how i prefer to see it. it’s an uncomfortable position to be in, but my take is that it’s more harmful than otherwise to try and hold onto one voice forever, bc you’re trying to hold onto a style instead of working on foundations and fundamentals that can adapt and be flexible while still staying grounded as you apply them to different things. i think the biggest enemy of writing is getting too bogged down by how each word sounds as you’re putting them down. people who hop around don’t seem like they lose footing in the way they write exactly bc they Hop around, instead of staying in one place and expecting that to hold their weight while they pull other things in. you have to meet art head-on, and of course your ~voice will change the way that any illustrator who keeps doing art will find a new style every few years. it isn’t a bad thing. i understand thinking you wrote better before and wanting to preserve that, but i think you run into danger of forcing yourself into stagnation when you get swept up in wanting one version of yourself to stay permanent. <br><br>again, i’m with you one hundred percent on this, and i really, truly sympathize with that awkward gap between one area of comfort and the next one. but i think… it sounds cheesy, but let your voice find you. just vomit words out, keep reading, write rambling tweets or journal entries, whatever works best. voice isn’t really something you find, i don’t think, and often it distracts us from the other things we Could be discovering. <br><br>does this make sense? i hope it does. tysm for putting so much thought into this q, and i pray that life is also kinder to you these days.</div>

 <div class=reply>i had serious momentum last night and was on a roll answering ccs until this one came in and i just Shocked into realization that it’s way past midnight and the new mitski had indeed dropped. so thank you so much for the heads-up, and for being so kind about asking for my thoughts. i wrote up a whole thing here bc you are all enabling my ranting and apparently i’m committing to that this year: https://cherrypick.substack.com/p/field-notes-laurel-hell-mitski<br><br>i’m kidding, though. mostly. i really appreciate having the space to talk, bc it’s rare that i often get to do it in real life, so it means a lot that there are people so generous to my rambling on here. so thank you as well for even thinking of me when the mitski album dropped, and beyond all my little notes in that newsletter: my overall thoughts are that the album is everything i wanted it to be, which is to say that it’s not a new favorite of mine, bc mitski set her own bar pretty high, but it will be on repeat ad nauseam. my top fav tracks at the moment are probably heat lightning, i guess and love me more, in no particular order. favourite lyrics are a tie between “i always thought the choice was mine / and i was right, but i just chose wrong” from working for the knife and “it broke my heart, the lengths you went to hold me / to get to have me” from should’ve been me, though both are songs that i think are lyrically gutting as a whole. <br><br>again, tysm and if you have any thoughts you wanna share / discuss, you already know i’d love to hear !!</div>

 <div class=question>hi there, <br><br>i was reading through your newsletters for the nth time again, and remembered that the lengthy version of your about section states that the idea of a newsletter appeared to you while reading beautiful world, where are you. i'm currently in the middle (or two thirds, realistically) of reading the novel myself, and i think i'm quite conflicted about how i feel about the book. on the one hand, the writing seems impossibly mundane; reading through some of the parts feels like dragging my feet through mud at times (oh god does that sound really inconsiderate of me). i also find that the characters, especially their dialogue, is fairly pretentious at times, though i decided to look past it because it really does add to the style of the book. despite my criticism, i can't really stop reading the book either. something about how its written seems refreshingly organic in a sense. i think the readers are left to depict the characters' emotions through their dialogue and body language, but it's not something that's made difficult for the reader. i don't really know what i'm saying anymore. this has gotten really long. i'm really sorry. <br><br>what i originally wanted to come ask was, what are your own opinions on the book? (also sorry if this has been answered before, i couldn't find the question if you have.) <br><br>finally, i wanted to thank you for your writing; i discovered you through flls and immediately fell in love with the beautiful way you write and you inspired me to even start my own newsletter. my gratitude towards you and your words is infinite. (one final apology if that seems like a lot.) <br><br>thank you!</div>

 <div class=reply>THE LENGTHY VERSION OF MY ABOUT SECTION I’M CRYING I FORGOT ABOUT THAT ?? but also, you have no idea how much self-control it took for me to not skip right to answering this cc bc man do i have Thoughts about beautiful world, where are you. in fact, i think i’ll post a couple screenshots of a rambling email exchange i had with a co-worker about it — how ironic — and i’ll link it here: https://twitter.com/sleeptowns/status/1489478506467762176?s=20&amp;t=W5YSfdaQ9T2SxY2CBs_WvQ<br><br>but that rant aside, just me to you, i completely understand where you’re coming from, regarding the pretentiousness but also refreshing organic-ness of it all. i find that that’s how i feel about sally rooney’s books overall, though her debut novel touched me more than the other two. i read someone saying once, regarding conversations with friends, that they don’t know how that book earned their care until they found themself devastated to reach the end, and i feel like that sentiment rings true for me with beautiful world, where are you as well. it’s always like — this isn’t the most cohesive thing, nor is it moving me in particular, yet i can’t stop reading, either, and by the end, i find myself with such affection for these characters. it’s the strangest thing. if you have thoughts to share, on the book or on my own thoughts on it, please feel free to drop by again. and most importantly, it means a lot to hear that my words have inspired something, anything at all, in your life, and you never have to apologize for that. thank you so much for taking the time to message me.</div>

 <div class=question>hello!!! i know this is probably hard to answer since a lot goes in a piece of writing that’s both unconsciously or indistinguishably inspired from another piece of media, but do you think you can sort of recall whether there was a specific book / song / dialogue / tv show / movie etc that informed flls as whole or one scene / conversation / chapter in particular? i hope ure doing well 🤍🤍🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>hi! and no, for sure! i don’t know if you’ve read the writing process post on flls, where i mention a few of the little things that gave birth to it, but the gist of it is that it started with stay by gracie abrams when it was featured in the show dash &amp; lily, a tik tok video on ukai toriyama as a wedding venue, and jjk chapter 132.5. then it kind of spiralled from there as more and more characters were brought in. i go into a little more detail here, if you haven’t read it yet: https://sleeptowns.tumblr.com/post/669792046652997632/first-love-late-spring-the-autopsy-report-pt<br><br>i hope you’re also doing well 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! youre such a thoughtful person so i was wondering if u could help me out w smth: i’m in my early twenties and in the past few years i’ve grown to be very diff from my core group of friends (ive pretty much only been friends with them my entire life). their interests are totally different from mine now, and for years i’ve had to hide what i like from them bc i’m scared they’ll find me weird and judge what i love if i told them. do you have any advice for dealing with the grief that often comes with drifting apart from old friends? it feels like i’m holding onto them just bc they will always be tied to my child and teen years, moving on would be like accepting that those years are officially done and gone forever, help!</div>

 <div class=reply>i love how this is phrased like an advice column message, oh my gosh. but hi! i don’t know if i have anything helpful to say, necessarily, but i feel a lot for your situation and i appreciate that you don’t ask me what to do next, bc i think you and i both know that what’s happening is inevitable. and i mean. friendship break-ups are hard enough as it is, and even more so when they’re not the direct result of any one thing. but the way i see it is that — holding onto who you were around these people is to slow the forward motion of your own life. which sounds so self-help ted talk of me, but there are people you meet and love and they’re right for the you that exists in that moment, but the ideal outcome is that you outgrow that version of you, and in doing so, you outgrow your old friends. and i say ideal bc i think it’s a good thing. it’s hard bc there was a point in your life that they would have been the first person you spoke to about this thing, but isn’t it good, too, that you’re moving into a new chapter of your life? wouldn’t it feel liberating, to grow into being a person who no longer hides what you like from the people you love precisely bc you love them? and i think, underneath all your fear of saying goodbye to your younger years, you also know that to move on from them is to acknowledge that there will come a time that they won’t matter all too much in the grand scheme of your life. i think that’s what we really grieve, in this case. that our childhood years and the friends we made during that period are only, like, a little blip. half a prologue. bc, you know, it meant a lot to us at the time, so it couldn’t just be half a chapter of barely even the beginning. but i also think that moving on from them isn’t denying they exist, nor denying that they were the foundation that makes it possible for you to become someone else altogether in your 20s. it’s fine to be hurt and be afraid that it really is over, and grieve it all you want and need to by letting yourself go through old messages or photos, but don’t linger. don’t stay stagnant over something that will always be there. the photos and the memories will never go anywhere. they might fade, but that won’t make them any less real, and especially not when they directly led to your current self, right? you’ll always carry proof of them in who you are, is what i think. it won’t ever be truly over, even as the friendships might be. but i don’t know. i don’t want to speak for you, and the truth is that it’s difficult and tricky, period. i’m sorry i couldn’t be more help, and really, sincerely, i wish you all the best on this and beyond.</div>

Like there's something about they way you put your ideas to words (look I'm an avid twitter followers of urs) and its so eloquent and always hits the right spot!!! All of this is to ask what authors or pieces of works do you think have most impacted you and of u could recommend aha 🤲 I'm trying to grow as a writer and your stuff inspires me so much and I love just seeing my favourite writers' favourite works so I can kinda get into their shoes in the least creepiest way possible (I hope this isn't creepy lmao).

 <div class=reply>no, please, trust me, this means so, so much. there’s no such thing as being told enough that people find something beautiful in the things i write, so thank you so much, and i’m glad my sleep meds rants on twitter come across as eloquent 😔<br><br>it’s funny, bc the first work to come to mind that has impacted me recently is the manga blue period. isn’t that so strange? i don’t think i realized how much it has reconfigured my relationship to craft until right this very moment, and i think it’s essential reading for any kind of creative. beyond that, i don’t read a lot of writing related nonfiction, but books that i have really loved stylistically are real life by brandon taylor, less by andrew sean greer, and the goldfinch by donna tartt. emotionally, i love whatever the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne and conversations with friends by sally rooney did with my heart, and so delicately. i love jeanette winterson’s prose but her stories are just not my cup of tea at all, to put it mildly, so it’s a balance in progress there. anne carson is also never too far from my mind, though i think it’s less a matter of her style having an influence on mine as it is her approach to art — subversive, personal, making what is ancient contemporary — trying its best to inform mine. oh, and love speech by sherry huang! easily one of my new fav books. <br><br>i know this isn’t the most conclusive answer, i’m so sorry. but again, thank you so much for your generosity to my words, and for taking the time to send me a kind word.</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s so interesting you say this bc i’m actually more of a coffee person? or at least i was? i’ve definitely been drinking a lot more tea lately than i used to. i’m mostly a black tea drinker, and my fav ones are the twinings earl grey — especially the one that’s cream of vanilla — whether by itself or in a london fog, and santa’s secret by davidstea. recently, a housemate has also started drinking twinings’ chamomile tea with honey, and i’ve kind of been coerced into drinking it as well for my evening wind down. i also love a good matcha, but that’s harder to come by than teabags.</div>

 <div class=reply>oooooh off the top of my head the movies i’ve rewatched the most / left the biggest impression on me are bringing up baby, whisper of the heart, paper moon, the last laugh, 20th century women, columbus, our little sister, hunt for the wilderpeople, honey boy and house of hummingbird + i’m a big buster keaton guy for reasons even i don’t know the root of. i also don’t like to admit that lady bird resonates so much with me bc it’s been co-opted by a specific corner of filmtwt, but to this day it and columbus are still somehow the most i’ve felt known by a film. i’m definitely missing a lot, but that’s on me for not keeping better track of these things, i’m so sorry. as for shows, i don’t watch a lot of them, but please like me and normal people are the ones i keep finding myself returning to. from the current ~prestige tv side of things, i only really watch succession.</div>

 <div class=reply>i think it’s actually quite straightforward, if only a bit broad in its scope! i found it super interesting, and for all that my relationship with classics academia is complicated, i did love my major quite a lot. i don’t know if i have tips, necessarily, bc again, classics is so broad and i don’t know what you’re into, but i guess what i can say is that classics is best navigated by knowing which field of it you like best. i think plenty of people go into classics bc they like mythology, which is perfectly okay, but classics is also learning ancient greek and latin, which i loved most but i knew others in my year who found the language-learning requirements the most distressing part of earning our credits; it’s also archaeology, which some might find fascinating and others boring; it’s also a lot of philosophy and ancient texts that some might find difficult or inaccessible. i think classics will do for you what you need it to do for you, so if there’s advice for me to give, it’s to figure out what that is. it’s such a broad subject area, broader than the more specific majors that at least draw distinctions between different fields of study, that it can’t do more than two things for you any more than being a philosophy major will do for you what being an english major can, if that makes sense. it’s good for greedy people like me who can’t commit to only one thing, but even hoarders such as i am had to choose one or two areas of specialization to avoid a jack of all trades, master of none situation. also, i’m convinced that pretentiousness isn’t as inherent in any other major more than it is in classics, and that’s very telling of the systems it champions and the people this attracts, i feel 😅</div>

 <div class=reply>no, no, you’re okay, i’m just — have i? it must have been different teachers from different points of my life that i was talking about? but no, yeah, i’ve been very blessed to have good teachers that i got ~close to for most of my time in school! i grew up largely without proper parental figures, but i’ve been quite lucky in finding mentors in the teachers i’ve had. a lot of them were my early english teachers, who taught me the language and encouraged me to write. three were teachers i had in my second year of hs, when i transferred to a new school after a disastrous freshman year in another one, and i owe a lot to their kindness and generosity in instilling in me a sense that there’s worth in the things i talk about, especially as a kid crippled by social anxiety and fear of using english wrong. in my senior year, i had three teachers i found myself mentored by, and i think the person that i have become is rooted in the person i was in those classes. there’s a lot to be said about how much i yearned in my younger years for the validation of adults — and there’s so much to unpack there — but i do think that even without this i’m still indebted to being treated seriously for what i have to offer even at that age. i resent so much of being told i’m older than my years, bc often that’s just code for growing up too fast, but whatever healthy variation of that i was able to receive from teachers who gave me book recs, entertained my side of debates, told me there’s potential in who i was — i’m very grateful for it, still and always. <br><br>but the only two teachers i’m still in contact with are my hs korean teacher, who still invites me and other alumni to events with her current students, especially on holidays like seollal or chuseok, and the prof i worked under as a research assistant for most of my uni years. i don’t want to get too sentimental about my rs with him, but more than simple kindness, i think i just really appreciated how i kept expecting him to be indifferent to who i am beyond being my value as an academic and he just never… was? he went above and beyond instead in addressing the mental health areas of my life, in insisting i’m capable of more than what i’m giving, and he never hesitated in getting me a flight, or inviting me to dinner with him and his wife, encouraging my hobbies. all of that. but this is getting too specific, so i’ll have to cut it off. but yeah. i owe a lot, lot, lot to so many teachers and mentors, so thank you so much for this q.</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you so much !!!!! brings me a whole different level of excitement when someone reads multiple works of mine, god. it means a lot to know someone is paying attention to that degree, and if you do ever read my newsletters — yes, i’m still doing them, miraculously — i hope you find something in them to like. <br><br>and my old header (i assume it’s the mirabilary one) was from notes on craft by lauren elkin! https://granta.com/notes-on-craft-elkin/</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no, no, i don’t, though i know enough to keep track of what’s going on in it onscreen and behind the scenes. i mentioned lexi in a tweet bc clips of her have been coming up a lot for me recently, but other than that, i don’t think euphoria is a show that would be a) fun for me to actually watch, as far as my tastes in media go nor would it be b) healthy for me to experience, mental health and headspace wise. if you know what i mean.</div>

 <div class=reply>no, no, you’re all good, and really, i appreciate how politely and considerately you’ve asked this. first of all, i’m moved to hear there are parts of flls you’d even want to annotate, let alone read from a physical copy, and i’m even more touched that it was able to help guide you back out of a numb period. i completely empathize with feeling this way, so it means so, so much that a work of mine has been able to contribute anything at all to someone’s realer, more present life. <br><br>but yes, i’m absolutely fine with printing it out, so long as it’s for personal use only! i’ve had some people dm’ing me in the past, and i do in fact have a formatted pdf of the interior and a cover, if you’re comfortable messaging me for a dropbox link. if you’re not, that’s totally okay, and again, i’d be honoured you’d want a physical copy for yourself. thanks so much for taking the time to message me and being so observant of any boundaries i might have ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>oooooh man. as gently as i can say this, no, very likely not. stsg isn’t a dynamic i spend a lot of time thinking and feeling about in any way that isn’t simple, straightforward and complete, and when i think of their story, i think of it in relation to what became of them, or how it might parallel current storylines, or the traces that remain in the aftermath. i think i replied to another cc almost a year ago saying that the tragedy of stsg is that there is nothing that can be changed about them, or something along those lines, and i stand by that. to tweak anything about them is to change, fundamentally, who they are as individuals. out of all the dynamics in the series, theirs is the one that — for all its could have beens and what ifs and the tragic aftermath — i don’t really find much in to Explore. explore being the key word, bc yes, of course there are things i can say, and things i can highlight, and there is “heart-wrenching angst” inherent in them, but what would be different about what i say that hasn’t already been said by however many fics are in their tag right now, you know? i wrote them in the background of one fic and gave them a happy ending in that, and i think that’s all i had to say about their dynamic and backstory that would still be nuanced, would still be true to their canon storyline. anything more, and especially a fic centred solely on them, would just be the same angsty character / relationship study that i’m sure plenty of people have written before me, and much better at that. so. i really don’t think i’m the person to go to for stsg, personally and creatively, if you know what i mean. but thank you, seriously. i appreciate you saying this, but please keep your life. stsg is a corner that i’m sure plenty of other writers are much more suited to doing justice.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have! oh my god. that sure takes me back. but it’s been years and Years, and i don’t know if i even remember much of it except vibes alone. i never did pick up the manga, either, so my memory of storylines are even hazier for lack of resolution. i did like it, though, and for a time, if i was asked to pick my fav shojo manga when i was younger, it would have been one of the contenders for the first answer to come to mind. i do feel confident enough to say that it was one of those pieces of media that was emotionally low risk, high reward, if you know what i mean? it never brought me anxiety, and never gave me anything that i ever doubted it would take care of, even if it leaned heavy into tropes. it was good, even, that it was so formulaic, bc then i learned to trust it and to be charmed by it for the trust it earned. from what i remember, the story was simple and sweet, so were the ensemble cast, everything about it and them made sense, and there was never a character i resented for being who they are. even then, i had a soft spot for characters like kurumi, and maybe she was the blueprint for how i will always find a place in my thoughts for the depths that her situation contains even without excusing how truly mean some of her fellow Popular Girl With Hidden Agenda archetype characters can be, but i really just adored everyone. kazehaya is such a rare breed of love interest, sawako a lovable version of all the tropes she might embody, and the love and sincerity of her best friends brought me so much endless warmth. ryu and chizuru were it for me, as i’m sure they were for many other readers. but overall, my perspective is that a good shojo isn’t a good shojo without a tight-knit, sincere friend group at its heart, and this, kimi ni todoke doesn’t fail on giving. so as far as going down a checklist, kimi ni todoke checked off the right ones in my book. it isn’t special, in all the things it is, but its simplicity is what makes it as comforting and trustworthy as it is, i think, and that in itself is a special quality.</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhh i want to note that i don’t know if i’d consider myself fluent in any language except Maybe english, if only bc my standards for fluency are a bit different for myself? i feel like being able to speak or understand or read a language is one thing, but it’s another altogether to achieve much more than just effective communication, where my thoughts and personality shine through in a way i can control as precisely as the language allows. the best way i can describe it is that english, for me, has reached the point where it is a tool, while all the others are more like traits that i possess and which define different parts of me. if that makes sense. i don’t want to claim to be some magically gifted polyglot who can go into academia in all the languages i “know” when i only use most of them in daily conversation or for consuming media the way an average person does. i’m a lazy person who has found a way to make some things work for me, is all. <br><br>that said, tagalog is my first language bc i was born and raised in the philippines. i am technically still fluent in it, colloquial and otherwise, but — again. i’m not meeting my own expectations there. i now live in canada, where the official languages are english and french, though everyone really just speaks english and whichever their heritage language is. i briefly studied korean in hs then i studied italian, latin and ancient greek in uni, mostly for the curriculum but the italian specifically bc i spent a couple of semesters in italy. spanish came by extension bc it felt more stubborn of me not to try it when tagalog is already riddled with loanwords + once you learn latin and a couple of modern romance languages, you kind of get ushered down the others? japanese is a language absorbed over my lifetime, in that i was raised with a lot of japanese media in the house and grew up never too far from consuming things in it one way or another, but it wasn’t until i was an adult that i figured it would be sillier of me not to take advantage of what i can. which i think sums up my relationship with languages, in that they come and go in my life and i love having one around when i have the option to spend time with it. but again, i don’t consider myself super fluent in any language except english. like. seriously. i really mean that. i think it’s more that growing up around multiple languages and in such a multicultural city has primed me towards a cultivating a deep interest in language learning, and it was stoked as i got older and found myself gravitating towards linguistic fields. so. does this answer your q? i didn’t even make sure. i hope it does. i never know how to talk abt this without sounding narcissistic and i promise that’s not my intention at all. <br><br>tysm for such a sincere question 😔🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oh dear i don’t read a lot of strict shojo romance anymore, unfortunately, but the ones to come to mind right now with romantic storylines or romance-adjacent slice of life themes are skip to loafer, honey lemon soda, ao no flag, hirayasumi, yawao to katako, kieta hatsukoi, kaketa tsuki to donuts, and 10th: you and i fell in love with the same person. my thoughts on each one varies widely, but i listed all the ones i could recall having read / tried reading in recent memory bc i’m not quite sure what you’re looking for in romance and slice of life? probably missing a bunch since i don’t have the best memory or organization system for these things, but i hope you find something you like in at least one.</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh this is interesting. like, a kind of item of clothing? or one that i own, specifically? i’m a big oversized sweater person, so that’s my go-to, and i never know how to dress in the summer bc i’m so reliant on them every other season. right now, i’m also really into fleece quarter-zips, bc they don’t trigger my sensitivity to certain kinds of fabric too much, plus i got a pair of boots last month that took me no time to break in bc i love it so much. i don’t really shop for clothing often? so it’s usually the case that i find a piece i like and it becomes my go-to, whether it’s a pair of jeans or the same slacks in every colour available or these boots. i also got crocs as an ironic gift but now i find that it actually is a decent pair of shoes to wear with some outfits so make of that what you will 😅 i also have like over ten pieces from coats to hats to socks from the shop frank and oak, and to this day, their stuff is still my default for someone with my height, default style and general approach to buying clothes while living up north. <br><br>i know this isn’t a very glamorous answer, even if i tend to have glamorous tastes in the fashion items i long for, but i really am a simple neutrals and basics guy who doesn’t have much money and can’t keep too much jewelry on for too long. the craziest my style gets is the splurge items i have from kina and tam. that’s it. otherwise, it’s frank and oak or the local thrift store with clothes from the elderly. forever toeing the line between grandpa chic and vintage. oh, but i do love a good statement coat!</div>

 <div class=reply>not too personal at all, i love this! my fav city atm is chicago, strangely enough. i’ve gone back around four or so times now, and i’ve never thought about living in it, but if ever life led there, i wouldn’t be opposed to it. ofc it’s still a massive, busy city, and i think i can only love it bc i don’t live in it. i get to visit it instead whenever i need a getaway, and so i can find smth meditative in the parts of it i like and have learned to strategically navigate so i’m not touched by the hustle and bustle. i love walking along navy pier, the water and the smell of popcorn and the night bands. i take the architecture boat ride every single time i can, even though it hardly ever changes, and i think i just love the architecture in the city, period, from the bertrand goldberg buildings to the ugly skyscrapers. the art institute of chicago is also my fav museum / art gallery in the whole world rn, and i’ve spent entire days there in complete solitude. though i’ve gone to the aquarium and the science centre + i saw hamilton in one theatre and one shakespeare play in another, both have had the same sense of being a visiting tourist that i somehow get to shed in stillness at the art institute and the navy pier. (plus it doesn’t hurt that ferris bueller’s day off is one of my comfort movies and chicago really milks all the associations it can with that film.) <br><br>i’ve also visited montreal as many times, but my rs with it is like… it’s another city in the same country that’s diff enough that i can play local for cheap without really doing anything i don’t do in my everyday life here, you know? i also enjoyed taipei, but i was too young and it wasn’t for long that we were there. i lived for a time in rieti, italy, and visited a few of the big cities like rome and florence, but bc that period of my life is marked by some bleaker emotions and memories, i don’t have the softest vignetting in my remembering of those places. but i’d love to go again!<br><br>and hmmm the easy answers are that i’ll send murai, yatora and tddk + momo from ymo to any of the places i’ve visited, but especially florence and chicago. god, if i could somehow go the art institute of chicago with murai, it would be the memory of a lifetime. i think megumi would enjoy chicago, too, and not just bc i associate him with architecture thanks to another anon, and flls yuuji would have such a good time in taipei, i feel. viktor and yuuri have prob already been to italy, in canon and at least one of them in my two yoi aus, but i’m sure they won’t pass on the chance to visit again. i’m running out of space but ahhh what a heartwarming thought, to think of all of them like this. tysm for the lovely q!</div>

 <div class=reply>always makes me giddy to hear about someone reading us, much less rereading it, so thank you so much for taking the time to tell me this! i feel a great deal of fondness for that fic now that it’s been quite some time, and it’s nice to know someone out there is thinking about and feeling for it.</div>

 <div class=question>heyo! hope this finds you well. i wonder what you thought of "the atlas six" as i loved "hand in unlovable hand" and there was something so wonderfully mysterious and intriguing about it that i didn't find in the actual novel. i wonder if you could tell how the you interpreted the book in a way that was able to birth hand in unlovable hand? (also, i know the fic's been deleted :(( so feel free to only answer what you thought of the book or nothing at all!)</div>

 <div class=reply>omg first of all thank you for being so observant of my influences and for also respecting potential boundaries on the fic! but don’t worry at all, i only deleted it bc i couldn’t commit to a multi-chaptered fic at the time, and so i super appreciate your kind words about it. it was a very new world and genre for me to tackle, and maybe another me would or could have had a more comfortable time with it? but anyway. <br><br>did you not like the atlas six, omg. i’ve yet to finish it, even months later, bc i heard the tor version is coming out soon, but the responses i’ve heard are very much polarized. i personally found it wonderfully mysterious and intriguing, to use your own words, with how it tied together all these ~magical abilities with the concept of knowledge and even traces of how both can birth a specific type of person, from libby’s untapped potential to callum being a nice subversion of empath abilities. i see what you mean, though, about the traces kind of going awry somewhere before ending up in hand in unlovable hand, but i guess it was just — the term people use for it is dark academia, which makes me wince, but i wanted to explore the systems and structures of jujutsu society through the lens of magic as knowledge, which i found myself drawn to in the initial premise of the atlas six. like, what does such an insular world look like for characters with the difficult pasts that i intended for all three of the jjk first years to have in the fic, and what purpose does it serve? that sort of thing. i think something that most conversations about dark academia don’t tackle as much is in how removed that particular kind of pursuit of knowledge is from the real world, but i also wanted to soften that kind of theme with how for lots of people, myself included in the time i served with it, academia is a found family of sorts. add magic and some adapting from canon material to the mix and voila, hand in unlovable hand was born. i know it’s not a very specific answer, but again, thank you so much for still thinking of the fic and for being so kind about it.</div>

 <div class=question>I think bp is slowly becoming a series that I will think about for a long time after it’s finished, which is to say it’s definitely a favorite of mine right now. I also loved your thoughts on twitter the other day about bp giving us the theme of having fun with your craft only after we see how much hard work Yatora has put into it. Also yayyy I’m glad you enjoyed the songs!! <br><br>I guess this is kind of connected to the previous paragraph, but I’ve been watching the docuseries about Fran Lebowitz on Netflix these past two days, and something she talked about was how she believes in talent being something you’re born with and it made me think of FKA Twigs saying “hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.” I just find the conversation about talent vs hard work and “being good at something” so interesting, and I think it’s to subconsciously distract myself from actually working hard at something I want to get better at, because I want to get to the point where I can eventually have fun with it. I would really like to work on my writing this year, so we’ll see. I also just want to be perfect at everything. Sometimes I think if I was immmortal I would just spend my life becoming The Best at literally everything I had the slightest interest in. But I don’t think it’s a fear of not having enough time holding me back either? I think even if I was immortal I would have the same thought process. Hmm I don’t really know where I’m going with this and I hope it wasn’t too personal or weird but yeah!! I think the first ask I sent was about passion and talent, so as you can see it’s been a topic I frequently revisit.<br><br>In doing more research, I found out I’m a 4w5! I checked out the song and podcast you recommended on spotify as well!! Although I haven’t finished the podcast episode yet, I did listen to some of the songs he created for each type :’) I think one of the reasons I love tests like this as well as astrology is because I’m still trying to learn a lot about myself. And maybe it’s also because I feel this need to have an identity, but it’s also like I don’t want to confine myself to this singular imaginary identity. It’s very funny and contradicting and something I end up thinking myself into circles with. <br><br>Hope you had a good week!! -☼</div>

 <div class=reply>at this point i have a specific smile for whenever i hear about blue period becoming special to newer readers so i hope you know how much it means to hear that. and ohhh was it the new york doc? i watched it some time ago as well, and it’s tricky bc i admire fran for lots of things but also disagree with a lot of her thoughts on art. it’s rare that i disagree with someone wholeheartedly on the sociocultural stuff without it also bleeding into like, literal human rights and civic issues, so talking about her is always a fun exercise on having a thought to debate with, and that includes her general sentiment — and i’m oversimplifying it here — on how making art has to be difficult for the majority of creators. i don’t think that’s true, nor do i think talent is something you’re born with in itself. interest and propensity towards something, sure, but when someone is supposedly born talented at something, i think they’re actually born with something else together, like a prodigious artist just happening to see the world differently from a young age, or a prodigious musician experiencing the world through sound differently. and that’s why i agree with fka twigs saying that hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard. bc sure we can say that someone is born with the ability to experience the world differently but that doesn’t equate to them being able to convey that in the art they make. not everyone born with perfect pitch or born into a family of dancers is a prodigy by default, you know what i mean? and i think people default to this mentality of thinking some things come innately to some bc then we can use the argument of thinking well they’re already more ahead than i’ll ever be and i won’t even be able to catch up, so why try? and so it’s more important to me to be comfortable with art than to be insanely, world-shatteringly good at it. only then can i have fun with it, and only then can i truly think it doesn’t matter where i place relative to other people. my relationship with it comes first. but anyway. no, please, not personal or weird at all, though i’m sorry for going on an unsolicited rant as always. <br><br>and another 4w5! i love that! somehow i keep pulling in 4s and 5s since you all started doing the enneagram test. and haha it’s very type 4w5 of you to say you like learning a lot more about yourself, but the need to have an identity is also the other side, the type 3, speaking, i think. it’s always interesting to see traces of neighbouring types on someone’s core type. but if you’re trying to look more into this, you can also look up growth directions and childhood wounds for the different types, though i think the sleeping at last podcast also mentions it a little? but so, so happy to hear the enneagram is resonating with you !!</div>

 <div class=question>original anon here! just a confirmation that i did, in fact, mean chainsaw man! i could’ve sworn i wrote it out in a sentence after but i guess i made that up. and to be fair i don’t think you talked about it a lot? maybe just mentioned it once or twice and it stuck in my memory for some reason. but yes i do agree!! csm is a character driven story at its best, and while the deaths did make me ugly cry i never felt like it was done for no reason. i always love to hear your thoughts on various media, especially when its something i enjoy so thank you!!! for indulging me with your beautiful words!!</div>

 <div class=reply>oh thank god, thanks so much for getting back with a confirmation! and no, omg, i absolutely didn’t want to discredit the genuine sadness people feel over the grim parts of csm’s story, nor imply like i was immune to it. like i was in a mood for days after it myself, just simmering, which is always a good indicator between me and a piece of media even if the feelings in themselves aren’t good per se. but i really, it meant a lot to me overall that the sadness in csm was so delicately earned, and that’s why we give it over wholeheartedly? but that’s another tangent. as i’ve gotten older, i’ve found that it’s gotten even more special to encounter emotion that a story works hard to earn, and i place a lot of value in it. so i think at the end of the day, among all the more specific thoughts and feelings i had about it, i just value csm a lot for what it is, period. so thank you for asking me for my thoughts on it 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>it absolutely is not weird at all, please, i welcome all song recs and even more so ones that people associate with flls :( it means so much to me that people are still listening to the playlist, and it’s its own personal joy for me to encounter songs i haven’t heard or paid much attention to before and still think of flls yuuji &amp; megumi even, like you said, almost a year later. i think bc it’s my longest fic, both in word count and the time period it covers, and bc it considers both perspectives of a relationship, it’s become such a specific world in my head, you know? not that i wasn’t immersed as i was writing my other aus, but flls is so huge in what it encompasses yet the feelings are so specific and it just makes for a different experience for me, as a writer, to keep seeing new songs and think of flls without hesitation, without contest. they’re their own people, in their own universe, almost. like, i was listening to the song j’s lullaby the other night and found myself thinking of them, and it’s fascinating even as it’s got me wistful, to kinda just check in with them through a song here and there.<br><br>but that’s just a tangential preamble to my point, which is that oh my god, this song. had my heart aching from the first two lines, and then these came: there’s a room in my heart with the memories we made / took them down but they're still in their frames / there’s no way i could ever forget <br><br>like ??? hello ??? god. and see, i also love this bc it feels like i am experiencing flls through how readers did and at times — somehow and wonderfully — still do. it’s unbelievable. those boys are always up in the attic of my heart somewhere, living their lives and loving each other, and i still feel so much about getting to revisit their journey there with a hard hitting verse or two every now and then. so thank you so much for this, what a note to end my night on. sending you warmth and well wishes, and i hope your week ahead treats you kindly 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>god the spike of adrenaline i felt at getting this cc is unreal. they have me in a Chokehold. but yes !! perfect guess !! sanctuary by joji ultimately won the chance at the title bc i love its bridge so, so much, and i also felt like parts of it were relevant to not just the fic but the dynamic that feels true between yatora and murai, especially the part that goes: ‘cause i’ve been aiming for heaven above / but an angel ain't what i need / pull me oh so close / ‘cause you never know / just how long our lives will be<br><br>but the very first song i associated with this pairing and by extension igyssr was actually heart out by the 1975, which also had a heart wrenching bridge to me, with: it’s just you and i tonight / why don't you figure my heart out? / you got something to say? / why don't you speak it out loud, instead of living in your head? / it's always the same / why don't you take your heart out, instead of living in your head?<br><br>if it only looked nicer in the ao3 format, a line from heart out would have bagged the title position, but as it is, i think both songs have this vibe that i don’t normally listen to a lot these days, and one that i haven’t really tried writing before? so it was interesting to have these two songs in my head while writing a fic that felt like unfamiliar territory in so many ways, and it’s been hard since to find songs that grasp that blue hour, dawn until morning, heat of the party back out into the cold scenery of igyssr. but thank you so much for this question; it made me incredibly happy.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello !! listen i am laughing to myself so much tonight bc i genuinely have no idea what things i have and have not mentioned and it’s so amazing that there are people who can keep track of me just spouting whatever about a bunch of things i don’t even remember. god. thank you for being so attentive. <br><br>i Have read all three of the books sally rooney has out right now, and two of her shorter works as well! i guess you can call me a fan, in that regard? though it’s more complicated than that bc i am not so much a devotee as i think i am just compatible with how she writes and what she likes to write about. which is to say, people and relationships and everything that pulls into the orbit of the narrative. that said, normal people, while i didn’t hate, is my least fav of the three novels. i think it presents some interesting theme along physical intimacy and knowability and the things we feel we deserve in our relations with other things and other people, not to mention it’s a compelling thing to have two characters drawn to each other from vastly different social classes, bc you can never quite shake off the implication of what connell’s mother working for marianne’s family means + it’s another thing altogether what remains accessible to marianne but inaccessible for connell despite his amount of potential. it’s been a while since i read normal people, though, and i don’t think i remember as much of it as i should, but the gist is that i didn’t hate it nor did i love it all that much, either. and compared to her other two books, i definitely felt the burden of reading a lot more? both conversations with friends and beautiful world where are you were impossible for me to put down, even when i was sure i didn’t care much for its characters, but normal people, while i didn’t hold any ill will towards connell and marianne at all, sometimes felt like a weight i was carrying and i can’t wait to put it down for a moment, even more to be done holding it. with that in mind, i do feel an attachment to the tv adaptation, more so than i do the source material, and all the things i found interesting in the novel felt amplified and distilled better in the show. so. you mention mixed feelings about the book, and i don’t know if you were thinking to watch the tv show at all, but from my end i found a lot of comfort in it and still rewatch some eps even now. <br><br>and i know you weren’t really asking for my thoughts on the other two rooney books, but fwiw conversations with friends is still number one for me, and smack in the middle for now is beautiful world, where are you, which i thought i enjoyed a lot more than i’ve found myself actually feeling like i do now that it’s been quite some time. also, please feel free to share your thoughts on normal people with me !! i’d love to hear or even discuss them, if ever!</div>

 <div class=reply>csm like — chainsaw man? or? Have i talked a lot about it? i have zero memory of talking about csm at length anywhere online and it is taking me out, oh my god. <br><br>i wish i recorded the three-hour ramble i went on after i first finished it if only to have those raw thoughts for posterity, since i find that i don’t really know how to talk about it. i guess my main feeling is that i avoided it for so long bc it was being billed as this dark, heavy, tragic, full of despair and grief story and bc those were the same descriptors i was seeing with jjk, which i don’t feel earned it the way i expected it to, i figured csm’s themes weren’t for me either. but i was peer pressured into it eventually and it was actually… pleasantly surprising. which is a huge understatement bc i did in fact love it, but i wanted to note my own surprise first bc i don’t actually find it dark or heavy or necessarily tragic and full of despair. every narrative arc in csm made perfect sense to me. it never once felt like a character was sacrificed in the name of a theme or an idea, and that’s a storytelling quality i value above all others? csm began a human story and every human being within it — even the ones who were not, technically, human; they still had enough of humankind in them to be — ended it no less than what felt inevitable to who they are. even aki. even makima. csm’s plot points didn’t wow, technically, but what it was is grounded and steady. unrelenting but uncompromising. it’s one of those stories that doesn’t try to be more than its characters, and i appreciate that so, so much bc it is a glorious strength when done right and fujimoto did. there was grief and there was despair, yes, but these emotions didn’t supersede the characters and their small desires and fears. and like, i think people tend to misunderstand me when i say that i like stories with small people and big feelings and nothing more, nothing less, bc they think i mean that i only like tender-hearted slice of life stuff, but i’d argue csm counts under small people and big feelings. at the end of the day, regardless of the setting and the abilities and all the elements that make it everything but a slice of life, it was still about constrained human lives yet big, human feelings. in everyone from denji to kobeni to himeno to power to even the idea of a contract and its equivalent exchange. city mouse, country mouse. the wants and fears that it all comes down to, in angel devil, in power, in makima, and ultimately, in denji. and there’s catharsis, too, in denji ending all of it with a sparse, simple meal. <br><br>running out of my space but i don’t exactly have a fav character so much as my fav dynamic was the aki, denji and power household! but that might be predictable of me. also, this will be embarrassing if you did not in fact mean chainsaw man so i am sending u some finger guns and hoping for the best !!</div>

 <div class=question>I first wanted to thank you for your kind and heartwarming response to my question about life after graduation. Your words and advice always feel like a mixture of a hug and a sigh of relief. I also think you're not giving yourself enough credit as someone to be looked up to!! I hope this doesn't come off as projecting? or like a parasocial relationship? but I'm not exaggerating when I say you have helped revive my love for reading and writing :) Your approach towards these practices is just so tender and gentle and I absolutely loved your tweet about Blue Period (which I have finally caught up with!!) and having fun with your writing and not thinking too hard about it this year. Secondly, tonight I would like to offer you three songs you might enjoy if you haven't already listened to them: "Speaking Sonar" by Summer Salt, "Younger" by The Hails, and "Different State of Mind" by Kid Bloom. I can't really explain it, but to me, these songs give off the same vibes as your writing does. Also just to go on a completely different tangent!! I finally took a couple of enneagram tests and found out I'm a type 4, so tonight I think I'll probably look up more about what it means. I think it's funny how you said you're a type 5, INTJ (or INTP?), and have a gemini moon (which I think you've mentioned in an ask before), so it's always fun drawing these lines and seeing how certain things are connected. Hope you're staying warm &lt;3 -☼</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my god, i’m incredibly relieved it felt like that bc i was on a roll these past couple of weeks answering some sombre ccs and i felt like with some of them, i got too personal or rambling without being helpful at all. so thank you for sending in this message, and i’m so, so glad it was heartwarming. i feel like i have to straddle the line between firm and heartfelt, and sometimes it’s trickier with questions where i have to be — at times brutally — honest. so. seriously. thank you for following up. <br><br>and no, no, i’m super honoured to hear that you’ve revived your love for reading and writing! it does feel like i have an obligation to remind people that, you know, i’m still just A Guy, flawed and petty sometimes and passionate to the point of obsessive other times, and my thoughts are only thoughts. while it makes me happy that people could find comfort in them at all, i also don’t want to present myself as some sort of all-knowing, authoritative voice in a life that all of us are just figuring out one day at a time, if that makes sense? but that said !! i love that you caught up with blue period !! that recent chapter really set the tone for the year for me, so i’m glad i can share that sentiment. <br><br>and you already know i love song recs !! i saw summer salt live a few years ago, so i can’t overstate how excited i was to listen to the other two, both of which went right into my unwind playlist ahhhh as a side note it’s super thrilling to hear this kind of music, specifically, be compared to my writing? i find this genre the most comforting bc it’s just the right balance between happy and melancholy, so this analogy struck me right in my Sha As A Person heart. feeling pretty tickled, i won’t lie. <br><br>lastly — and please, i’ll be the last person to ever deny tangents — your memory is amazing, oh my goodness. i do have a gemini moon and sometimes get both intj and intp, though lately i think i’ve settled into intj. but more importantly !! you found your type !! that makes me so giddy !! i don’t know if you listen to podcasts, but the singer sleeping at last did some songs some time ago on each of the enneagram types and covered the songwriting process of each one in their own podcast ep, so if you feel like you want to hear about your type from an actual person instead of website hopping, i will gently point you towards the sleeping at last podcast and the episode titled ”Four” &amp; The Enneagram. i personally don’t think i’ve listened to it, but i’ve listened to a few of the other eps in the series and am a big fan of the songs overall. so. but it’s only a suggestion! like i told someone a cc back, i’m always happy to chat about the enneagram so if there’s anything you wanna discuss, cc is all back up and running and i’ll be here ☀️</div>

 <div class=reply>between you and me… i got into it bc i was a catholic school kid and in my last year of high school we had to study it in religion class as a way of bringing us closer to god. so that’s very telling of what the enneagram is, i think. but it’s also my fav personality typology! if only bc it’s the one i know best and for the longest, so i have a degree of comfort and sense of knowability with it that i have yet to achieve with astrology, for example, or that i’ll probably never have with the mbti system. it’s also served me in writing fiction outside of fics, and sometimes even in understanding the characters i’m writing in an au. while you might see me poking fun at it, at the end of the day i do feel quite connected to what it is, and it’s been quite beneficial to me in navigating myself and my relationships.<br><br>i think a test is always a good place to start! the first one i ever did was the 9types test we had to take for class, and i felt that was a good starting point. if you’re unsure with the result there, you can supplement it with the eclectic energies one. crystal also offers its own test, but i only took that one as an add-on to the work habits test i had to take for a fellowship, and i don’t know if i’d recommend it as a starting off point. <br><br>with the enneagram, it’s quite common for some specific types to mistake themselves for specific others, so don’t worry if you don’t feel known by what you get at first. the enneagram institute has a page dedicated to misidentifications, and it also does a good job of listing the basic desire and the basic fear of every type, which is the key to understanding your type and seeing if one is right for you or not. there’s also something called wings, which is the neighbouring type that informs you more. so, say, i am a type 5w4, where w stands for wing, but other type 5s might be a 5w6, with the other side as their wing. while we may both be 5s, we have different instincts and ways of seeing the world. same thing with a 2w1 vs a 2w3, and so on and so forth. what i always like to remind people is to pay attention to how the enneagram chart is drawn, bc those lines and that circle doesn’t just mean nothing — but don’t be daunted by it, either! i personally find the enneagram a very straightforward typology, while still examining crucial variables in someone’s interiority. <br><br>there’s still so much i can say but i also know this can be quite overwhelming, so i’ll leave you with this! and absolutely feel free to swing by again any time, i love talking about the enneagram; if you need help with your type / want to know more about subtypes or the center that your type belongs to, i’d like to believe i know enough to know where to send you or what to look at next!</div>

 <div class=reply>what a lovely q! hmm i love seeing strangers in an awkward position while reading, esp on public transit. or how, when i first moved to my current city for uni, i loved that it’s customary for everyone getting off the back end of the bus to shout a thank you down to the driver, whereas where i used to live, people only said it if they’re passing the driver on their way off. i love that you’re expected to hold the door open if there’s someone coming in behind you. i love the little tap tap routine people do on welcome mats when we’re coming in from the snow. i love hearing people order coffee in montreal, how the most random words of a french sentence are said in english. i think i just love hearing seamless code switching from bilingual folks. i love when i’m at a crossing and a car driver waves at me to go ahead, or seeing dogs hang their heads out a car window, or frequenting a place and starting to catch familiar faces. i love how every single interaction i witnessed or participated in on nye ended with a warm happy new year greeting. i love catching someone casually feed another person. i love when neighbours interact, like bringing their emptied trash bin into the driveway before they get home, or bringing over misplaced mail. i love the things my friends do to show me their affection physically while respecting my aversion to touch, how a friend of mine from hs tugged on my ear absently as she told me about her day, which i promise is less strange than it sounds, and how another friend squeezes my arm in lieu of a hug when we meet up. i love how none of my male friends are good with direct words, but they’ll squeeze my knee or pat my head and do a little jerk of their chin to check in on how i’m feeling. i love when people i don’t expect to be warm with me end up being so, like when i interviewed someone for an article and the next time he saw me he jokingly called out, it’s my best friend! or how my tattoo artist had me over for an extra hour after our session to hear my thoughts about launching an online art shop, or how when i had a breakdown in italy, my prof did not hesitate to pick me up, buy me a flight, and later, wait with me at the train station. but this is getting too specific now oops <br><br>re: fics, flls had one ear tug, i think, and skow had a couple absentminded feeding scenes bc it’s a mark of a long term rs to me! otherwise i take cues from the source material, such as how canon yuuji likes to scratch his nose or his neck and glance to the side, and how yatora from blue period tends to cradle his elbow when he’s nervous. little things, but they help me get the character better, you know?<br><br>thank you so, so much for this question 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha!! a while ago, somebody asked you abt the languages you were fluent in &amp; aside from a bit of french and latin, i remember you saying that both english and tagalog were the ones you knew about and spoke the most (correct me if i’m wrong, please, i’m totally basing myself on memory right now!). from your newsletters and your fics, it’s safe to say that you perfectly know how to use english just like molding play dough — however, i was wondering about the properties of tagalog (vocabulary, sentence construction, sounds etc.) that are different from english! i dont know how to Explain this question, but you can just answer with what you think is special about tagalog (english is not my first language so i know that there’s a lot from my mother tongue that can’t be conveyed nor expressed in english &amp; i’m sure all languages around the world have that!)</div>

 <div class=reply>don't recall what languages i mentioned in that cc, either, but you got the fundamentals in perfect order, so thank you so much for remembering so well! that said, to preface my answer, idk if i’d say tagalog is a language i strictly Know About the most, even though it is my first language and i still speak it regularly — at least not in the sense that i feel like i know english and latin, for example, bc those two, i learned the textbook way before they became more intuitive. tagalog, i was just born into, and it’s only one of hundreds of dialects in the philippines, and i think that changes your perspective on what a language contains. <br><br>but i love this! what a fascinating question, omg. for me and maybe it’s just bc i speak it more often than others minus english, tagalog is the language that has the most personality among all the ones i have? i like that it’s a strong, unbudging language, that its phonemes are rooted and grounded. no syllable really gets eaten up, and i think that lends itself well to different kinds of rhythm than what might be available in english, for instance, or in a tonal language like mandarin or vietnamese. there’s no such thing as soft in tagalog, really, even though you can technically make a case for linguistic terms like allophones or intervocality existing with some consonants. to me, all of it is still grounded in the syllable, in the sound that each part of that syllable makes. i love that the g is never hidden, aside from in maybe ng. but even then it’s front and center. i’ve dealt with a few languages where the sound that g makes varies, like 기 끼 and 키 in korean, or how in french, the throat kind of eats it up a little, or in italian, you either have it hard in a word like gallo or you give it up to surrounding sounds as in gnocco or gli but in tagalog, g never, or hardly ever, has what you’d call allophones, in that the g sound doesn’t really change depending on how a word is spelled. i think that changes everything in the language. <br><br>i love that tagalog is so playful, that — as with most languages, granted — there’s some idiomatic expressions that don’t have the same ring in translation. and people always go for ostensibly untranslatable words like kilig and gigil, but even jokes, insults and compliments that make grammatical sense in english don’t quite retain their humour or warmth or hostility when translated. that, to me, is the mark of a beautiful language, you know? when it’s irreplaceable. sure, no language is really substitutable for another and you’ll always lose something in translation, but there are languages like ancient greek, or german, and very much tagalog, where it doesn’t matter how much of the meaning you retain, the personality is embedded in the source language itself, and it alone. <br><br>had to cut this answer down massively, but thank you so much for the wonderful question and the compliment you snuck in there. it means a whole lot.</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh man it warms my heart to see some wolf alice love, so thank you for sending me this cc. i love the thought that there are still people listening to the playlist and having their own thoughts and feelings about it :( and isn’t it! iirc that was one of the first few tracks i added after cementing how i wanted flls to end and i remember being so undone by how it somehow described the mini arc of megumi’s relationship with yuuji. looking back at it now, it’s even applicable to his perspective in the coda / between chapters 6 and 7… maybe i should bring it down a little lower in the order.</div>

 <div class=reply>gracie !! my fav pop girl !! my fav nepotism baby !! my go-to for morning tunes !! her music in general is my fav guilty pleasure in that i can always rely on it to be that safe space between making me feel things for it while also not demanding too much of me, sensorily or critically or emotionally. so i was really stoked when this album came out and i no longer had to play the same ten or eleven songs in her existing discography. i loved all her 2021 releases before the official album drop — unlearn, feels like and rockland by themselves are in my top five gracie songs so far, probably — but i really liked that as a cohesive whole, this is what it feels like is a definitive next step from her first album. the production is less sparse, more confident in its instrumentation and chord progressions even if it isn’t necessarily bigger, and the underlying themes of the songlist are tighter while also being more creative lyrically. feels like and rockland are still the standouts for me, but i also think the entire album is just one of those that burrows in you slowly but steadily with more and more listens. the first time i heard it all the way through, it was well and good, but i wasn’t shaking, crying, throwing up on the ground, you know? then you give it a few more listens, and the heartache in for real this time gets more prominent, the bottom becomes the song you cathartically shout along to, older is a waltz alone in the kitchen at 2 A.M. and with all that, alright is the perfect final song to both the album and this period in gracie’s career. and that’s really all i ask from an album. i still play it on instinct these days when i’m too lazy to scrub through playlists and new albums. it’s just perfectly compatible with my default emotional baseline and mood on a daily basis, i find, and unless gracie does a three-sixty into a different genre altogether, then i think i’ll feel this way about anything else she releases from here on out as well.</div>

 <div class=question>ahh hello there! I know this may sound silly, but I really look up to you and I hope it’s okay if I ask for some advice :) I’m graduating university this semester, and I guess the thing I’m most worried about is the transition back into a life where I feel like I won’t have a purpose anymore. I think this definitely stems from my problem of staying present and existing in the quieter moments of life; I’ve always felt like I’ve had to study or work or be productive in some sort of way in order to “earn” my existence. I don’t have a job lined up, and I honestly don’t even know what I want to do with my degree (english literature), but it’s the fear of feeling lost that scares me the most. I hope this isn’t too personal or invasive, but how has life been for you after graduating? Have you felt this way before? I hope January has been treating you kindly so far &lt;3 - ☼</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s not silly at all! but while this is incredibly kind, i promise i’m not really someone worth looking up to. i’m still a messy, prickly, confused person, and as such, i might not offer the best answers to a lot of the questions i get on here. with that in mind, of course, i still want to offer my loose thoughts. <br><br>i do completely feel where you are at the moment. i finished uni smack in the beginning of covid, and it was hard being someone who was a workaholic as a natural state of being (i.e. coping mechanism) and going from double major student with two jobs to just someone at home. done with school, technically. no ambitions. valueless, worthless, if we go by the standard we set for ourselves about having to earn our existence by how productive we are. ultimately aimless. i didn’t have a job lined up, either, let alone during the height of pandemic lockdown. it got to a point where i randomly emailed this magazine to pitch myself for a position they didn’t even have, and i’ve been very lucky since in that it’s been a heartwarming experience working there. but that’s all it is. luck. timing. the job had nothing to do with my degree or my work experience, so it couldn’t have been skill, either. i just happened to luck out, and that’s something you’ll hear a lot of the peers around me admit about where they are in their careers. many of us just jumped at the first opportunity we saw open, and if we got it, we knew it was maybe forty percent at most our skills and/or experience and sixty percent luck, whether it’s bc someone knew someone who knew someone or bc we just happened to be the personality type that a place was looking for. so keeping that in mind, however the next year after graduation turns out for you, know that it’s not all on you or the things you did or didn’t do. it’s a tough world out there, and even more when you’ve internalized this sense that your inherent value as a human being in a capitalist society is how productive you can be. this isn’t true, above all. you don’t have to earn a basic quality of life. and i’m sure you know that deep in your heart, but this isn’t to say that you have to be perfectly content with a quiet life, either. there’s a good middle ground there, somewhere, between not breaking your back being productive for a world that can’t care less and not living a stagnant, silent life. the only thing i can really say is that… be open to whatever that middle ground might look like. leap at anything and everything but don’t jeopardize your sense of self for it. it’s normal to feel lost and not know what to do next, and so it’s all the more vital, i’ve found, to be fixed in my values but flexible everywhere else. something will come. so be open to it when it does. most importantly, congratulations on all your work these past few years and wishing you all the best this last semester.</div>

 <div class=question>sorry if it’s been asked before but do you plan out your fics in a specific way? whenever i think of something good to write i always struggle with its basic outline, as in the build ups the turning points etc. i used to think of something and just write till my brain and heart empties but my writings lacked depth and i think its because i don’t think enough about the flow of it all<br><br>your stories have such a smooth flow to them i feel like im boating on a gentle stream ;-; its so easy n wonderful to take in ! and i wondered if you had a specific way of planning it out before committing to writing it all out ! &lt;3 if not or if you don’t want to write it out no worries, hope u have a good day/night &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>this is one of those questions where i know my reply must change a little every time i answer it, but — first off, thank you so much for such a lovely compliment! it means a whole lot, with how often i used to worry that i write so much and so densely that flow is the last thing i have to offer to a reader. so really, truly, thank you. i’ll be carrying the boat analogy close to heart. <br><br>however… i do… not… plan out… my stories. it gets me into some rough spots, for sure, but i know that i just don’t feel comfortable strictly outlining. it makes the process rather stagnant and boring and restrictive for me, and i also find that i can’t manually engineer flow into happening. it just… flows when it’s right, and if it doesn’t flow, then i’m probably forcing something somewhere. BUT. BUT, BUT, BUT. this is just my personal preference and experience, and i deeply empathize with your situation. it can be quite tricky to find what process works best for you. i tried to outline a bit in the past and it just never worked well, and it’s only been through trial and error that i realized how i work ~best if only for now. <br><br>with all that in mind, while i’m afraid i’m not much help overall, what i can suggest to you, maybe, is to try to mix it up? as in, maybe start with just writing until your brain and heart empties, as you said, and then consider that your first draft. but if you’re studying it after and find that it “lacks depth,” then note down the areas where you feel that way and maybe try to create an outline to follow for the second draft. or, alternatively, start with an outline but only keep going up until a certain point, and start writing with the structure you’ve established only as a loose guide. then fill out the rest of the outline as you go along, switching between writing freely and checking in with the structure you might want to keep in mind. if that makes sense. i feel like i’m just giving you things you probably already know and have tried, but the crux of it is just that writing for me, like drawing, works best when it’s left loose in the right places. and always keep in mind that no matter how easily writing might come to you some days, that doesn’t mean you have to stick with everything that comes out of you in one go. you can always redo entire stories. you can always rewrite from scratch, or try a scene another way. it can be a lot of extra work, i know, but it’s been very valuable to me to give myself permission to just freely do trial and error. so. yeah. those are all i can offer, i’m sorry. but all the best of luck, and as long as you keep testing things out, there is no wrong answer to such a thing as your process. <br><br>(also, if there’s anything of help to you in it at all, i wrote up this thing on one of my fics in an attempt to figure out how i think as i’m writing: https://sleeptowns.tumblr.com/post/669792046652997632/first-love-late-spring-the-autopsy-report-pt)</div>

 <div class=reply>grief is tough. it’s really, really tough, i think, because it pulls in so many other emotions with it — anger, sadness, resentment, everything. and if you’ve loved something enough to grieve its loss, then there’s no real, proper recovery from the aftermath of something that important to you. so i just want to say, for what it’s worth, that i appreciate you asking how you Deal with grief. not how you move on from it, or how you stop feeling it. to those questions, my answer would be that you can’t, really. grief already is the aftermath, you know? you can’t move past it completely. or at least i haven’t been able to. whether it’s the classmate who passed suddenly almost a decade ago or the authors who passed last month — it’s still there, the grief. it never goes, because the loss never does, either. <br><br>that said, i’ve had to deal with my fair share of grief in my personal life recently, and i think the most difficult part, at the start, is the awareness that nothing will be the same again. that’s been the hardest thing to stomach. that i have to live With grief now, that it’s not something i can just get over with and be freed from all that it’s making me feel as soon as it’s done. so. i know it’s hard to hear, and you probably don’t even need me to tell you this, but dealing with grief, as with any other emotion, starts with acknowledging it’s there. it exists. you’re valid in feeling it, for whatever reasons and whatever capacities you do. but it’s because this is such a necessary first step, acknowledging presence and intensity, that the one that comes after is harder — to just, simply, move on with your life. live your life without the something or someone you’re grieving. do everything else you would have with or without it or them. i think people tend to struggle with this step because it feels like you’re not respecting the grief, but i don’t know if that’s true. i think grief doesn’t need our help to stick around. it will linger no matter what, and the only thing you can do for yourself is to not let it govern your life. don’t let the last thing they leave with you to be the grief. feel it however you need to, articulate it if that would help, take some time off to rest, but the fact remains that you still have to live, messy or not. it’s a cliche to say that it gets better with time, because i don’t know if it does get better or easier, but life is a malleable thing, and eventually it will learn how to go on with the grief within it, however intense or irreparable or neverending it might seem. the most you can do is to give it momentum. it will be hard. it is hard. but i promise something will click, eventually, and it might not be better or easier, but it will be less messy. let yourself get there… is what i would say. <br><br>i know this isn’t the best answer and i’m really sorry. i’m sending you my love and all the warmth in the world.</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t know how you managed to land on the one and only john green book i read (did i mention it somewhere? there’s a lot of determination in this) but i love how unexpected this q was for me. <br><br>that said, here’s the bottomline: i don’t like this novel. i have nothing outright kind to say about it, so if you are a big lover of it, then i’m really sorry and please do not read this cc. i don’t want to to trash smth that means a lot to you right to your face, and i promise i still honour what it can mean to you even if i don’t like the book. but really. if you love it wholeheartedly and will be unsettled by criticism gracelessly heaped upon it, please move along. <br><br>i read lfa as a teen on tumblr, around the time when people were reblogging b&amp;w gifs of effy from skins and the letter that alex turner wrote to alexa chung… and i think, for better and for a lot worse, it embodies that culture quite well. everything that it romanticizes and glamourizes, and everything empty about that romance and glamour. i don’t think it’s even fair to call the characters in this book pretentious when they weren’t really characters so much as they were vehicles for half-formed poster-ready quotes that sound good enough in isolation that you convince yourself there might be depth to the story as a whole. but attempt at being edgy is not depth. treating characters as walking standalone ideas is not the same as narratively and thematically serving those ideas. i think jg’s novels tend to play at complexity and yet fail to deliver, and that they have a skewed idea on how to represent the themes they are supposedly meant to be tackling. <br><br>all that said, i was also a depressed teen who wrote edgy stories that likely also romanticized hollow intelligence, mental illness and themes like “the great perhaps.” it’s practically some western media-infused take on a form of middle school syndrome. so i acquiesce that for all i can tell, maybe the characters in lfa are in fact apt representations of the teenagers that, at the end of the day, they are. i’m coming at this book as a twenty-something who sees nothing redeemable about novels from the mid 2010s like this one (don’t even get me started on eleanor &amp; park), but i am well aware that my perspective doesn’t encompass any teens or people in general out there who might see themselves in some of these characters or find that the story resonates. i am just Far from being one of those people. as it is, there’s nothing i hate more than daring to write “dark” subjects and still doing so with hollowness, at times even with shameless emotional manipulation and a diluted ya-friendly form of tragedy for tragedy’s sake. there are ways to write about complex topics well without shying away from them. all that looking for alaska doesn’t shy away from is its lack of complexity… is what i think.</div>

 <div class=question>i’m guessing you’ll have listened to a couple songs by now but!! i do recommend listening to their predebut tracks as well! 12 solos is a lot, so while i personally love every single one, i do think let me in, eclipse, and heart attack are the ones that personally stand out to me. i think predebut especially, they had so much variety in their discography it’s such a joy to explore! i really enjoy their subunit songs as well, with sonatine, love4eva, and loonatic being personally favorites. i do think one of the highlights of loona is their cinematography, so i also recommend watching the mvs! heart attack is very iconic, and for good reason!! but even their other mvs have very sapphic undertones, though a lot of it may be me projecting. love4eva mv is one of my absolute favorites, the vibes are very present. their recent songs do have a bit of a different vibe imo but i really do love them all the same. when it comes to group bsides i really love satellite, star, and fall again!! their debut song hi high remains my favorite title track because of my love of bright fun kpop. of course, this is all just a recommendation of course, so feel free to ignore this if it’s overwhelming or wasn’t really your style! everyone has different opinions of course, loona’s discography just ends up very personal to me for various reasons, and i wouldn’t expect anyone to feel the same. i apologize if i came off as forceful at all;;</div>

 <div class=reply>no, no, you’re good, i appreciate this! and god, it honestly slipped my mind again until this cc, so i’m glad you sent another one. i don’t really have a very discerning taste in music, so what gets me hooked on them is based entirely on how its ~vibe reaches me — so it never, ever hurts to have someone with so much affection and dedication to an artist nudge me towards titles. <br><br>so, okay, i haven’t listened to Everything, but, rapid fire: heart attack was so, so fun! very second gen girl group beat and vocals to my ears! someone in the yt comments said that let me in felt very nostalgic, and i agree! the strings on the orchestration are also stunning??? but ECLIPSE!!! THE MIX? THIS FELT VERY FRESH AND UNIQUE WHILE STILL CATCHY AND DANCE-Y! i listened to a few other solos (not all yet, but i will!) but love cherry motion left the deepest impression on me; i love the contrast of the bubblegum songs i have such a soft spot for, but then that beat drop dskskjs i think it’s so interesting and i’m really into how the choreo is so minimalist but also still — pretty? AND OH, I KNOW LOVE4EVA. THE RECOGNITION WAS IMMEDIATE THE MOMENT GRIMES STOPPED TALKING. I DIG IT. ALSO, THE MV? HELLO? ARE THERE THEORIES FOR THIS? I’M INVESTED. ESP WITH THE UNDERTONES YOU MENTIONED. and omg star is a bside ??? that’s a whole title track. <br><br>i also decided i might as well listen to their whole debut album, and i really, Really vibe with perfect love and stylish! both make me feel good and enlivened in a spring day, breeze in my hair, sun on my face, stray petals in the air kind of way, but also with this underlying sense of days gone by. the closest comparison i can think of is how some tracks in the pink tape album by f(x) makes me feel. melancholic but lovely nostalgia. <br><br>overall, my thoughts based off what i have heard are: their discography seems very varied! in the sense that there are multiple ideas and vibes at play that might be overarching, standalone concepts for other groups. they do the bright fun kpop, the airy, elegant princess kpop, even the rookie bg adjacent kind of kpop. and in doing so, they somehow have an easily recognizable sound, which is a feat considering there’s so much of it conceptually that juggling all of them is in danger of turning out messy. they make being a bigger, more eclectic group work for them, from what i’ve seen. and it might also be bc no matter what, it’s anchored in the same sentiment? whether the ballad-y solos or the punchy, cheerful group titles, there’s the same undercurrent of nostalgia running through. is what i think. so — i’m running out of space, but no, no, don’t even worry, i completely understand why they would have personal weight for you, musically or otherwise, so thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me. i’ll go listen to more solos !!</div>

 <div class=reply>whew. okay. hmm. i hope this answer won’t sound too harsh bc i promise i mean it with as much gentleness as i can offer someone as young as you — but my honest opinion is that i really… don’t think… those are your only two options? like. i graduated high school six years ago, and in those six years alone, i can already fill all my fingers with all the times i have changed my perspective on my future, for better or for worse. bc — listen. no one thing is guaranteed to make you more money simply by being what it is. i’m sorry to say it, but it’s true, and it will become even truer in the future. a capitalist framework and system will tell you that one path is guaranteed more money bc of its supposed “value” to society, but there are so many other factors that go into it than just being spat out into the world at the end of your time in school magically rich and generously employed. it doesn’t work that way. whether or not you pursue something you’re passionate about, it won’t change the possible reality of having to network, having to apply to thousands of jobs, having to work years before you can even make enough money that can go into things you want and not your bare necessities. the truth of the current job market and a world in crisis is that nothing is certain and stable. not even your typical jobs like doctor or lawyer, etc. and industries like tech are even more shaky. <br><br>so what i will say is that — find a way to live a life that isn’t the black and white future you’re envisioning right now. pursue Everything. if you want to go to art school, there are ways to getting certified by google through online courses if that’s a path you might want to keep open. school is not a one track from one end to another. take courses in everything from neuroscience to spanish. participate in extracurriculars that have Nothing to do with your major. the important thing here is that you get to your future. i promise, promise, Promise you that the initial choice you make at eighteen won’t be quite as life-altering as it must feel right now. it’s only one step to a road you gotta build yourself. the only thing you have to do for your future self is ensure that when they look back, they see a road with a wide, solid foundation, no matter where their life might go from there on out. bc eventually, there might be ways to find something you love in the thing that will make you money, or a way to do the thing you love on the side, just as there are also ways to sour your relationship with what you love by pursuing it when it won’t make you money. does this make sense? <br><br>i’m sorry for ragging on you with a little rant there, and i don’t profess to be some final authority on this, either, but my thoughts are: you are so young. you have so much to grow and change your mind about. i promise you that life doesn’t have to be a game of This Or That, and it will be okay bc you’ll make it okay.</div>

 <div class=question>Sorry if this is too personal, you don't have to answer it of course but how do you deal with loneliness? The feeling of being left out, left behind by friends, your closest not feeling close to you anymore?</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t think there exists a balm for loneliness, per se. i think loneliness is a perfectly human emotion that happens to arise for the very same reasons that we need human connection. you can’t have one without the other any more than you can’t have all those day-night, earth-sky analogy thingies without them being pairs. so to me, loneliness — like grief, like jealousy — is often a response to a lack. and in this case, loneliness is a response to you feeling left out and left behind. so if you ask me, personally, and of course i’m not, like, a licensed therapist or even an authority on this kind of matter at all — i’d say that it’s not really loneliness you should be figuring out how to deal with. it sounds like you’re asking me, “well, this is how my friends are making me feel. how do i deal with it? how do i stuff it in and not make it a problem for anyone but me, who’s the only one to know the loneliness exists?” and that’s not very fair to you or your feelings, right?<br><br>my take on it is, there’s nothing we can really do about loneliness. it is what it is. but the good news is that something is making you feel lonely. it’s not an emotion you just happened to give yourself. chances are good there’s something you can do about the thing making you feel lonely. i know it’s such a guidance counselor thing to say but — have you spoken to your friends about this feeling? sometimes affirmation can do wonders for feeling connected to a friend. or, say, is it maybe not even about them but you feeling like, “god, i have no one”? which is a difficult, complicated thing to think but i assure you it’s not true. the best and worst part of living in the modern age is that a person can’t truly have no one nowadays. or are you feeling lonely, maybe, bc it feels like your friends have busy lives and full, happy days and you don’t? that might tap into something we call mimetic desire, which is this concept around us mimicking the desires we see other people having. at which point the only thing i can say is to find something that will fill your days, too, and don’t let what other people want define what You want. you know? <br><br>i’m an incredibly lonely person, too, and in many respects, i have no one, but i am also very lucky in having found fulfilment in other things, in other ways to talk about the things that i feel or think. loneliness can trick us into feeling invalidated, bc the truth is that many of us need to be perceived to exist. so — you know. the best practical solutions i really have to offer is to make yourself exist, if only to yourself. write a journal, record yourself talking about a thing you like, whatever it is. just bc you feel left behind or ignore doesn’t mean you or your feelings deserve that. <br><br>that said, i’m fully aware how i sound and it’s really neither helpful nor easy. i know that. and i am sorry that i don’t have a magical cure-all for your situation. i really wish i do.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello again! 🤍 i… used to keep a written journal? my english teacher in my last year of high school encouraged us to keep one, and for that whole year and another after, i did religiously maintain multiple notebooks for my thoughts and such, so those years are terribly but vividly documented. but i’ve fallen out of the practice since, at first because i started getting into the habit of writing my friends long emails and letters, and then eventually i just became too busy to sit alone with my thoughts and sometimes might even prefer it this way. that said, the things i wrote about then aren’t too different from what i will probably write about in a newsletter now, for example. just stray thoughts, or expansions on notes i left in the middle of the night. like, for example, if i had time to write a journal entry now, it will probably be on this thought i left sometime this past week that was like, “how do you not rush when the world is hurtling towards doom?” and it was just this sentiment that kept occurring to me each time i heard an older person on nye saying that if they could give their younger self advice, they’d tell them not to rush, that things take time. to me, that’s valid and i’d probably offer myself the same sentiment, but at the same time, you know, i think older generations don’t quite grasp that the sense of urgency in today’s youth isn’t just because we want to grow up quickly. it’s because we know it’s highly unlikely we’ll have a proper, “normal” world to grow up into when so many of us have already lost our teenage years / twenties to the pandemic and will keep losing it to the civic and climate crisis. we’re all living day by day not by choice but to cope, and because it’s often more logical to think of it that way. so. a journal entry would be dedicated to that sort of thing.<br><br>i feel like somewhere in the second half of that paragraph, i bypassed my last opportunity to make this reply sound lighthearted but i still think it’s a decent example. my journal entries in high school have been more personal ones, or talking about media that i like, or a good / bad day i had, but that kind of introspection has since gotten more “adult” in a way, or at least grown into something a bit more broad and maybe even jaded. but also just more critical. so if i write a journal entry now, it will probably be on something that’s stuck being perhaps too critical or too non-well-articulated. something that’s worth writing but not being seen by more than my own set of eyes alone. if that makes sense. thank you for the question and for being so thoughtful about boundaries !!</div>

 <div class=reply>i’ll be completely honest: these past few weeks, i’ve been getting a special, particular warmth from people talking about my ~style and describing it to me, because it didn’t really fully occur to me that i have a recognizable style at all until i’ve had people reading multiple works of mine — but anyway, my point is that this has me feeling even more 😊💗✨ than usual, so thank you so, so much. you describe my writing so kindly and thoughtfully, and on top of that, there’s nothing i am more grateful to hear than having my writing described as healing despite all the emotional mess and introspection that might unfold. thank you, thank you, thank you. it’s all i can ask for.<br><br>and i love, love, love big chonky books! off the top of my head, two of my all-time favs are the goldfinch by donna tartt and the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne, but i also have pachinko by min jin lee and priory of the orange tree by samantha shannon in my radar for this year and feel comfortable enough to rec those two as well.</div>

 <div class=question>okay this is a stupid pointless ask but i’ve sent you ones before and i am so happy to find out you read comics. it feels very special to me because i think they’re so underrated when it comes to storytelling i guess. ALSO, i love kate and i need you to know that david aja, the artist for the hawkeye comic run, is not being compensated at all, when as you can probably tell the opening credits are heavily inspired by the aesthetic he used for the comic &gt;:( it makes me sad</div>

 <div class=reply>no, no, not stupid and pointless — but also noooo, oh my god. david aja isn’t getting compensated At All? and i assume matt fraction isn’t, either, even with the mcu using the tracksuit mafia’s literal Everything and kazi and god, there were so many scenes where i was like 🤨 that sounds / looks like it was straight from a panel. and i won’t even call the credits inspired; they looked like they were directly from david aja’s art. oh, this is so disheartening. i still have one more episode to go before i finalize my thoughts on the show as a whole but oh man :( <br><br>and i do agree with comics being an underrated form of storytelling, particularly in the circles i frequent! while i still try to read graphic novels here and there, my time with comics peaked during my young avengers phase as a teen / young adult, and it is breaking my heart to see how they’re making their way into the mcu. like, i do like mcu kate. and i loved seeing wanda’s twins in wandavision. but it’s just not — like, i wasn’t expecting it to be the same exactly, but i don’t know if i was expecting this, either. there is so much i am losing around the group i adored so much, so. it’s a big sigh. matt fraction and david aja’s run is so near and dear to my heart, too and — i am wringing my hands. it’s never been this personal before, you know? what you see lost from the source material to the mcu.</div>

 <div class=reply>this reply is Such a long time coming, i am so sorry, but i also have to confess that i was so flustered — in a good way — by this that i kept putting off having to respond to it until cc went down but now it’s back and i still have absolutely no words for what i can possibly say to thank you. oh my god. like. are you serious?? are you for real?? this is legitimately making me lose my mind. i always feel like i have to discourage any descriptions of me that are too overwhelmingly positive because of course i am not love and care all the time, and there are plenty of things about me that i would not describe as comforting or outright genuine if to be genuine is to be unfailingly sweet — but it still feels incredibly nice to hear such sentiments circled around my general existence, i admit, and it brings Me comfort to hear that there’s any comfort i can give. in some roundabout way. if that makes sense. this is just unbelievable. no, because, truly, this cc is a special one. my mind is spinning. thank you so, so much.</div>

 <div class=reply>i have read it! i… was also a classics major, so as mildly as i can phrase this, i wasn’t around people with any kind things to say about madeline miller’s work, even at their most generous. if you know what i mean. and a lot of it, i stand by, as much as i also do think her prose has its moments. that said, i salute people loving her work, you do you, get excited for the persephone one, etc. i just happen to be on the camp of “i do not like this and i cannot be persuaded otherwise for my own reasons.” i’m sorry.</div>

 <div class=reply>yup… yup. one of my best friends in high school was a dedicated reader, and i basically just read every book of his that she lent me. all in all, throughout my life, i’ve read sputnik sweetheart, after dark, norwegian wood, 1Q84, hear the wind sing, in that order. the wind-up bird chronicle has been sitting on my shelf for about a decade now with the bookmark about twenty pages in, but it’s still not a complete “i might as well donate this” kind of no. <br><br>(and uhhh if you also wanted my thoughts on him — i am personally not a big fan. i see what it is about the vibes he writes that’s so singularly his and why that draws people in, but to put it gently, what he considers substantial and valuable in the stories he writes just don’t happen to be the ones that i like to read when evaluating favourite books for substance and value. i don’t find myself empathizing with his characters. i don’t find myself stirred by his plots. i don’t find myself enamoured with his prose, in translation or otherwise. and that’s a lot of checkboxes not to have ticked off. if magical realism is what i need, there are plenty of writers like isabel allende and carmen maria machado to stoke what i need kindled. but i will say that after dark is somewhere in my fav books of all time, for absolutely no reason other than, “this was an irreplicable read.” so maybe i kinda get it? and just don’t feel like i do for most of his work? i don’t know. one in five books isn’t a shining record.)</div>

 <div class=question>sha, whats ur relationship with the four seasons when writing? do u have a season u like to develop the plot in the most? is there a season u find harder to write? when coming up with a story, does ur brain have a default season for it to be set in (or does that tend to be irrelevant)?</div>

 <div class=reply>this is such an interesting question! thank you so much for this; i’ve never had to contemplate this before. <br><br>i think i tend to write my stories in the season that i myself am currently in. i realized quite recently that because i always start so blank, i usually end up starting with the sensory imagery that is already available to me. i won’t say it’s irrelevant, whatever’s in my brain, but in a sense, if i have a default season for a story to be set in at all, then it’s the one i am currently in irl. <br><br>that said, it looks like i write less often during autumn and spring, which coincidentally are my more favoured seasons. a good chunk of my fics were written in winter and feature december quite centrally, while most of my bnha ones were written during the summer and so the stories begin around then, too. if we want to unpack that, it probably has to do with me doing a bit better mentally and emotionally around autumn and spring, whereas summer and winter — december, especially — tend to find me in lower moods, in need of distraction or something that doesn’t take as much energy or brain power as whatever my stressors are. hence the sudden peak in indulgent writing output around those months. but it could also very well just be that a lot of my fics were written while i was in university / working around a university school year schedule, so winter and summer are when my breaks were. <br><br>other than all this, though, i don’t think i choose a season to write in and run with that, necessarily! but i should, i think. i’ve never written a story set in autumn. i wonder what that would look like, if changing the season would naturally change the course of the narrative 🧐</div>

 <div class=reply>the sentiment behind this is very kind, but i worked as a research assistant for three years under a ancient numismatics prof, so my thesis was kind of chosen for me bc i’d be a fool not to take advantage of those three years. and i promise you that you don’t want to read my long, crazed paper on the coins of the emperor hadrian 🧍🏻‍♀️</div>

I love to share things I love so much with people I truly like. Anyways, I honestly love the characters sosososo much and the story is amazing (imo), the manga is even better and idk, when I read the manga or rewatch the anime it feels like my safe little corner, which is funny considering the themes of the story.

 <div class=reply>not weird at all, please, i love people sharing things outside of my usual radar! i Have watched bungou stray dogs, but not much of it? i think it came out around the tail end of my animanga phase in those years, and i just never ended up keeping up with all the other content that came out — but i am versed on which characters are who and all of that stuff! so i totally understand what you mean about there being something funny with how bsd, with its themes and worldbuilding, has become your safe little corner. but like, you know — sometimes it’s like that? sometimes you find a thing with characters that can only exist in that specific pocket in this strange little world and that’s why it roots itself so much deeper when you find yourself attached, because it becomes quite literally irreplicable and irreplaceable as a fixation. so hey, i feel a lot of a secondhand warmth to hear there’s something you love with such depth and sincerity, and for what it’s worth, it’s likely i’ll get around to picking up where i left off with bsd at some point and i know i’ll be thinking of this cc when i do ☀️</div>

 <div class=question>i’ve been thinking about ‘us’ since i read it MONTHS ago, i dont know how to tell you in words how much that fic affected me. i felt like i was holding the face of someone i love and listening to them talk the entire time i was reading it. or maybe it was the other way around ?? i was blushing and hiding my face and squealing and clutching my shirt as i read it. i don’t know, but it’s 3 am, i’ve read it again, and it’s still so full of feelings !!<br><br>not sure if it’s been asked before but did something inspire us ? because i love this trope and i think you delivered it so beautifully i just can’t get over it,, much like so many of your other writings, i think it deserves sooo much love. hope you’re doing well ^-^</div>

 <div class=reply>YES. OH MY GOD. YES, SOMETHING DID INSPIRE US. BUT I CANNOT, FOR THE LIFE OF ME, REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CALLED. it was this lovely short story of two boys in love in this kind of end of the world setting? and specifically, there was this scene of the two of them in the car, it’s the last day of the world, and they’re just holding hands and staying there while everyone else is freaking out. i think i’m imagining at least part of this for sure, but in any case, that story — which i can’t find, god, i’ve combed through my history, my instapaper, everywhere — kind of had me thinking about a pocket of stillness at the end of Something, and i guess that was the vibes i carried with me while i banged out us. everything else — childhood friends, long distance — came part and parcel as the story was forming itself around the image in my head.<br><br>that said, i always worry that it’s so short and i wrote it so fast without really any thinking at all, so it’s so nice to hear that it reached you on any kind of emotional level! it’s definitely the quiet middle child among my little family of jjk fics, but i understand why. doesn’t mean that it doesn’t mean the world when i get a cc like this, though, so thank you so much and i hope you’re also doing well as can be 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>what an interesting question! i really loved thinking about this, esp with such a specific context to it. the first things to come to mind is this series that the on being podcast is doing called “the future of hope” where they basically get all these artists and creative thinkers in and talk about themes relating back or adjacent to that title. i’m only two eps in, but i have a fair amount of confidence that the whole series would be a good listen. that said, here are a few i liked from the convo with pádraig ó tuama and marilyn nelson and felt were relevant to your request: <br><br>“The moment we inhabit now is very fraught, and I suppose the teaching, the learning of my background that’s most present to me now is the historical memory of where we came from, what our ancestors survived; how, in African American culture, there is a hope — a fierce hope that sustained people in spite of everything. And, I don’t know, I’ve told students often, over the years, that just touching that history, just imagining how people went on, is a source of strength, because the forces of the world seem to be intent on destroying our grasp on hope.” <br><br>—<br><br>“In Catholic and Episcopal churches, you’ll find 14 images, from the time that Jesus of Nazareth was condemned to d—th to the time that his corpse was laid in the tomb. [...] What I like about the Stations of the Cross is that they don’t say, ‘Oh, but then there’s the fifteenth one, where it’s all lovely, fantastic.’ In the traditional understanding, there isn’t a fifteenth station. The idea is to find hope in the practice of what seemed to be the worst. And it is the worst. There’s no pretense that abduction and torture and murder are anything other than abduction, torture, and murder. However, there is the understanding that, within it, we can discover some kind of hope — the hope of protest, the hope of truth-telling, the hope of generosity, the hope of gesture — even in those places.” <br><br>—<br><br>“[Romanticizing and valuing story] is the way we need to move forward in a world that is so interested in being comforted by the damp blanket of bad stories. [...] We need stories of belonging that move us towards each other, not from each other; ways of being human that open up the possibilities of being alive together; ways of navigating our differences that deepen our curiosity, that deepen our friendship, that deepen our capacity to disagree, that deepen the argument of being alive. This is what we need. This is what will save us. This is the work of peace. This is the work of imagination.”</div>

 <div class=reply>i do! my most listened from this last year was one called constellation prize, which is basically a limited series of sorts. every episode is different but i am so enamored by the mixing and the writing and everything. i adore it so much. on a wider sense, the popular ones i listen to are the usual group of this american life and adjacent shows, radiolab, criminal, 99% invisible, the cut, modern love, etc. reply all used to be my fav big show, before everything went to crap, but now the only gimlet show i listen to is heavyweight. hmm. what else. i like on being a lot! that’s probably the conversational one i listen to the most often. on nights my insomnia is acting up worse than usual, i like to listen to beautiful stories from anonymous people. on the fiction side, i enjoyed mabel, the magnus archives, gossip, the bright sessions and the two princes, each at various periods of my life; most of these have released new eps since, but i am not caught up.</div>

 <div class=reply>hm. the… o-adjective. i think it is the o-adjective. i don’t believe that’s a bad thing in itself, and i promise my view on it has no bearing on me making judgments based on what i see others feeling about it. that said, i didn’t… love it, and i… struggle to see why the things people highlight when talking through what they loved about it are perceived in that way. objectively, i think that its main appeal is centred on glamorizing something that for me is more style than substance, if not worse by way of how it handles jazz as a part of the story through a character like ryan gosling’s; subjectively, maybe i simply don’t happen to be the person that this particular style appeals to, and that’s okay. i understand that there are people to whom this film means a lot to regardless of what it is to me. <br><br>i did appreciate the argument scene and the ending! i’d say those were the strongest parts of the movie, to me, and the parts where the substance — the acting, the things unsaid, the music — was allowed to breathe without being funnelled through such a heavy hand on style.</div>

 <div class=reply>sure, i do! it’s mostly one song here and there, though, and i’m definitely no taylor swift scholar as far as the depth that i see on other people goes. (i don’t think i’ll ever be, either. the lore and the general — i don’t know what a good word would be — attachment? doesn’t seem like it’s a fit for me.) but i did enjoy folklore and evermore a lot, and beyond those, so far, i’m really fond of you are in love and call it what you want. wow i sound like an elderly person trying to get with the kids oof but there you go 😔</div>

 <div class=question>IT'S MORE THAN OKAY YOU TOOK A MONTH AND I TOOK A MONTH AND A HALF 😭i’m glad you took your time and it is like,, SO okay. we all need time to settle sometimes—i know what you mean and it feels like being in a pupa that’s being like bottle flipped or something. actually wait i don't know whether bottle flipping is a worldwide phenomenon but you get me! you get the picture.<br><br>it has been,, so so long since all of those things happened so i'm gonna give the fastest rundown of my life these past couple of months: came back from lahore after a couple weeks (it was fun!! i met a lot of my mom’s friends and every single one was like “ur mom rlly was SOMETHING” it was so funny). my sister came back from hk for the summers and it was lovely but weird bc she stayed in my brother’s room while he stayed w me and the lack of proximity meant her leaving home was much less emotionally fraught than it had been last time. our exams that got shifted to july happened and i was notttttt stressed enough but i aced all of them! 8 a*’s now for my o levels!! i’ll get my last 2 grades in jan. my sister’s 18 &amp; my brother’s 14 and I’M SEVENTEEN. ITS SURREAL. it's like—i’m glad i was able to acknowledge how painfully young and knobby-kneed i was at 16 bc it makes being a year older more settling than anything else. and yes, evolutionary as in: change brought more as another stage in a cycle and less as a wearing-down of myself; more security than disillusionment.<br><br>school’s started for the first time in almost two years!! it’s—so, so many things. good and bad. i'm missing art and my old classmates with a vengeance, now that i don’t take it. media studies is fascinating and literature is my ever-beloved and it’s sooo gratifying to finally be able to study them in such depth—thank you for telling me about the work you do btw, bc that definitely helped me pin down media management/smth similar as a potential future path. also!! also. studying poetry properly is so COOL and it’s opened up this whole new way of looking at any kind of writing. so worth it. <br><br>my cousin joined my school this year and we share 2 out of 4 classes and she’s moving two streets away this weekend and i am! beyond thrilled!! it’s so much whiplash to see her interacting with friends of mine without me being a middleman lol. i’m growing much closer to my brother and it’s lovely—i used to be really worried about him bc growing up as a boy (esp here) can fuck u up, but he’s a good kid. he’s easier to talk to than my sister—we’re 15 months apart and were so nearby in terms of school &amp; extracurriculars &amp; living area so we’ve always had friction, weirdly enough. it's strange but good. i’m doing okay, i think.<br><br>i’m running out of charas so!! sending u my love, always. let me know how you’ve been, what you’ve been thinking about! what you said about the sanctuary is the sweetest thing and really really does mean a lot to me. take care. &lt;333</div>

 <div class=reply>okay, before i forget to mention it, i promise i’ll get back to your comment on the first huckleberry letter at some point. for now, know that “i still love the way you write, really really no less when it's not fiction you're sharing.” really, really had me tearing up. i didn’t even realize i needed to hear that until you said it. god. <br><br>unless you mean a different kind of bottle flipping, then i am 70% confident i know what you mean? or at least i have a picture of it. that said, i’m glad to hear your sister still did end up coming back to stay with you all for a bit and that you had a fun time at lahore! can only imagine what hearing stories about your mom was like sjhsjhs it’s super sweet that it sounds like they all keep in touch. i empathize a lot with what you mean with your sister’s leaving not being quite as emotionally fraught this time; i’ve had to send off some loved ones myself in the past couple of months, with school starting back up &amp; people having to fly off to another time zone or live on a far away campus, etc, and i think a part of me was anticipating it to be more difficult and yet it wasn’t. i wasn’t indifferent to it, exactly, but it’s the distinction between a twinge and a prick, i think. the goodbyes the first time around put a lump in my throat and underneath that, this almost-melancholy, but with this round, it’s been — it gets hard to breathe, for a moment, and there is that second when i return to an empty house alone that i think, oh. okay. but then it passes, and it’s fine, and everything goes on easier. <br><br>you aced your exams! you turned a year older! look at life accelerating for you! &amp; i like how you describe the process of evolving, in that there’s a point where growing up feels like having less of something, particularly in those more liminal ages, but eventually something settles and it starts feeling like a glass half full situation with each added year under your belt. “more security than disillusionment” needs to be a more prevalent theme in coming of age narratives. let me write that down somewhere. and oh, i’m glad that little rant from so long ago helped in pinning down at least Something. and that it sounds like you’re enjoying a return to school in its own small ways &amp; you’re getting some quality time with your cousin and your brother 🤍<br><br>oh god. has it really only been a month and a half? i feel like so much has changed on my end. wow. i got eye surgery done and the world is so bright these days. i am reading and writing more. one new thought is wanting to explore more parts of the self that i haven’t put work into before; in particular, i feel like i’ve neglected spirituality and physicality in cultivating my own interiority, so to speak? but it’s only a half-explored thought for now.<br><br>all in all, it’s so, so nice to have you back here !! sending you all the best at school and at life, and take care, always.</div>

 <div class=reply>it isn’t awkward or weird by any means; if anything, i’m really happy to have you drop by again 🤍<br><br>and you’re reading my newsletters !! thank you so much !! also god, you have no idea how much hearing that means to me. i always felt like some newsletters, by design, tend to feel inherently distant, and i won’t pretend that this same distance wasn’t the appeal to me of writing huckleberry friend in particular, but i also want it to feel — genuine? sincere? in the sense that i do approach it with this same image of writing to a friend and can only hope that’s what it feels like on the receiving end as well. so i cannot overstate how happy and comforted it leaves me to know that this has been achieved even in some part, plus that you still enjoy my nonfiction. thank you, thank you, thank you, i hope everything is going well with you as well, and come by any time.</div>

 <div class=reply>okay first of all thank you for bringing it to my attention that i never posted my little debrief on flls bc god knows if i would have noticed otherwise 😅 also saves me the effort of trying to be concise with my answer bc i am never concise, but if you go to the first part here, under “roots and seedlings,” i talk about all the little thoughts and prompts that went into flls: https://sleeptowns.tumblr.com/post/669792046652997632/first-love-late-spring-the-autopsy-report-pt<br><br>to summarize what i said there about the plot, too, it was definitely only a vague idea at first? in retrospect, the plot in its entirety didn’t even fully materialize until maybe halfway into me writing what would end up chapter 5. and as for why itafushi, i think it’s a bunch of small things as well! i went into jjk with no expectations at all, and it was such a nice, pleasant surprise to find myself being so fond of yuuji right from the very beginning, and as i read more, i found myself with a lot of thoughts about his various dynamics with other characters — so as far as writing went, it just so happened that his particular relationship with megumi felt like the best one i can work with in my usual approach to an au. and if we want to get super specific, flls began bc i wanted to write some sort of interaction bw yuuji and megumi’s ~family. <br><br>but yeah! again, thank you for this little nudge and i am sending you back all my love !!</div>

 <div class=reply>i am not sure what counts as an anime movie but i’ll try my best to cover all my bases here !! <br><br>whisper of the heart is my top ghibli movie and also just one of my all-time favourite films; it’s both comforting &amp; inspiring in ways that seems to shift a little towards something different as you grow up and rewatch it, and in a way, i tend to rely on it as a compass for where i’m at creatively and emotionally. do i still love the art form i’m practicing now the way these two kids loved the difficult pursuit of their own dreams? do i still feel known and held by this movie? if yes, why? if not right now, then why not? and it leads me towards a lot of self-reflection without it feeling like i’ve been dragged around in therapy. it’s also the one i’ve seen too many times, and both seiji &amp; shizuku are two of my fav characters 😊<br><br>one i used to like but now likely won’t is a 2013 film called hal? at the time, i watched it with some online friends and that informed the viewing experience, but looking back, it was quite lacklustre. the norm in the fic-writing community i was part of back then was a lot of angst that i would now go as far as to label superficial and at times even manipulative, &amp; in a way, many of the tropes along that same approach to story was reflected in hal, which is about a robot sent to someone who had just lost their loved one. it might also be that i’m more ruthless with picking apart depictions of grief, &amp; i tend to be selective about how it’s portrayed, but if we’re going by this same premise, i think the black mirror episode be right back, also about a robot taking the place of a lost loved one, handles the same themes better. in the reverse of that, one film that didn’t quite resonate with me when i was fourteen was 5cm per second but i suspect if i watch it again now, it has a decent shot at being a well-liked movie of mine. it’s directed by makoto shinkai, who’ll later make kimi no na wa and weathering with you, but i am pretty solid on my opinion that a few of earlier work was stronger. <br><br>one i loved in childhood is the satoshi kon movie tokyo godfathers, which i’ve been thinking about rewatching this christmas bc it is still in essence a yuletide movie &amp; i’m curious how well it has aged now that i’m much older. my fav director among the mainstream japanese animation scene is masaaki yuasa, and i recommend trying basically all of his movies (key word: movies) but on the topic of christmas, i always think about his 2019 film ride your wave. a sparse yet fair exploration of grief, but with a yuasa spin. <br><br>running out of both space &amp; films off the top of my head but i hope this reply suffices! and that you find something you like! if i had to pick out just one film from this whole thing, i’d say either whisper of the heart, if you haven’t seen it, or ride your wave!</div>

 <div class=reply>words are not doing good today but there’s this thing with the characters in the secret history, where it’s not like i love the characters in themselves so much as i feel as if i’m in on an elaborate joke about how ridiculously they’ve been characterized and That is what i adore about the reading experience. there’s a point where tartt characters are drawn with so much absurdity that you end up on the other side faced with such a richly portrayed character, and that's precisely the case with boris. it’s interesting bc i liked the goldfinch even before we got to las vegas, and i was upset when theo had to go, but then we meet boris and he is so, so, So vibrant that the pages felt empty in the period bw theo getting on that bus and their reunion. there’s a lighting up that happens when he’s on the page, and part of it is bc theo describes him with so much animation that it’s palpable even to us. the details he describes boris with, the memories he mentions as an unreliable narrator particularly in those inebriated years, they all jump out with clarity and colour and it is the purest distillation of emotion that i personally felt from theo bc it was not Cushioned by anything. his grief over his mother was the overarching thing, and we know how present she is in his mind from the first line of the whole book, but it’s exactly bc of this complicated mix of emotions abt his mother that his rs w pippa, kitsey or mrs barbour are so loaded to the point that the filter it passes between his motivations as a person to how they come across externally ends up rendering those rs almost insincere. or at least emptier, bc we know what he and kitsey got engaged for, we know his attachment to pippa is out of the trauma they share. yet none of that plays a role in theo’s dynamic with boris. young boris endures theo’s grief and survivor’s guilt in near dismissive stride, bc he already decided theo was his friend and this is all just part and parcel, all the lying down to cry on the road, all the need to be held. no matter what, they gave each other this unflinching loyalty that was so foundational to them even making it to adulthood at all. <br><br>out of space again ahh but the only other few pts i had were — boris is terrible. he’s so, so terrible and i love him in part bc theo loves him so much, too. loves him bc for all that he can try to outrun his own life or try to be a functional person by making a dysfunctional family functional with his presence, he is also hungry underneath and he knows it. so when boris returns to his life, he goes. he goes bc it feels right, bc it’s all messed up but it makes him feel alive bc Boris is so alive, and it all goes to crap in amsterdam but it’s also the only way that theo’s time with that painting and his grief could have ended, and boris is the awful, beautifully vibrant heartbeat at the centre of that whole story.</div>

 <div class=question>oh my god!! im honored d-2 has been bumped up to the top of you list now but i also cant believe you never listened to the other members' mixtapes sha! please do consider adding and bumping them up to your playlist because i think you will most definitely find smth to love in them when u give them a listen.<br>hoseok released "hope world" in 2018 and it is a very Him mixtape its very upbeat and hopeful and it feels like sun on your face on a summer day. "blue side (outro)" might be one of the best outros ever made in history but you tell me ur thoughts on it when u listen!!<br>namjoon put out "mono." on the second semester of 2018 and sha... please listen to the whole thing in one sitting because it rlly is a thorough experience. while hope world is that friend you call on summer nights, mono. is that friend that hugs you tight on a night filled with tears who might not tell you that things will be okay (who might not, actually, know when it will all get better), but who understands your pain and wants you to feel held and seen. i see you a lot in "tokyo" and "moonchild", but if we r being honest i'd say that i wouldn't be surprised to find any lyric from any of mono.'s track in a piece of writing of yours verbatim or just as a resemblance.<br>IM RAMBLING IMSORRY. take your time to listen to those three mixtapes please! i'd love to hear ur opinions on them once u do!!!!<br>(also...i may or may not spend the rest of the week soaring through the skies bc i ended up pinpointing my favorite author's bts bias. keyword: may.)</div>

 <div class=reply>five days later and i'm back with Thoughts !! i listened to mono during a snowy late night cross city train ride and it was precisely the backdrop i needed to immerse myself in it. i knew i'd like it a lot, and i do, but for reasons quite different than what i initially thought? my anticipation was more in the shape of: rare time alone in The City, a quiet day at the museum, reading in the park. it still ended up feeling like a rare moment of quiet in a busy city, but it’s like the difference bw solitude vs loneliness, you know? one is chosen, the other is pressed upon you. there’s freedom in solitude, but — and idk if it’s bc the first two tracks are titled after cities — the vibes in mono for me was this specific urban loneliness, closing in for all these various reasons you get fragments of in the lyrics until it reaches this crest in uhgood. then it releases you. i think that’s why everythinggoes was the standout in the mixtape for me. it was catharsis. but i should say that what’s notable to me abt mono is that although it’s rife with the burden of living in connection with other ppl, it never once feels suffocating. it was a diff kind of raw than agust d was, and when i listened to it again, i knew to trust it to release me eventually and was able to soak in the loveliness of moonchild, which is my second fav. overall, i agree entirely with you saying it understands your pain and wants you to feel held and seen !!<br><br>d-2 was pristine. i feel kitschy using the word artistry, but where agust d had this raw, serrated edges to it, d-2 felt very much like a polished creative venture. it was a capital p Production. listened to it a second time with my best headphones in and the mix was Chef's Kiss<br><br>saving hope world for last bc surprisingly it was my fav of the three !! where mono was introspective and internal and d-2 was yoongi exploring the parameters of how much he’s grown as a producer — and both mixtapes are so strong for these very reasons — i think hope world was this goldilocks middle perfection of personal and creatively experimental. it felt new and fresh in terms of what you expect from bts’ discography, but in a way that was unapologetically all hoseok. i chose a good morning to listen to it for the first time, and it’s made me contemplate how we express our positive emotions through physicality. it’s easy to cry when we’re sad or to tighten up when we’re angry, but bc this mixtape was so joyful and also produced in such a beat-heavy, choreo-oriented way, i couldn’t help thinking about where those two points, heart and body, meet. i can only assume hobi was as well, in conceptualizing this whole album as a dancer. to me, objectively, it’s a perfect solo project. it’s been on nonstop repeat. <br><br>this reply was heavily cut down but i hope my pretentious half-ramblings convey how much i liked listening to them. thank you for persuading to it, and for all your sweet kindness to my writing 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>yes, that’s the one! i thought i was tripping and not remembering the title of the mixtape so much as i am the name agust d, but no, it really is named that. i remember i used to pay for soundcloud premium or something bc it was only available there back then. those were the days 😅and no, omg, i haven’t listened to d-2, or any of the other bts mixtapes (iirc about a couple other members releasing some. i think namjoon and hoseok? but i also remember learning winter bear by taehyung on ukulele. did he release one as well? you know what, i should google this after.) anyway, i am bumping d-2 up to the top of my list now bc you describe those songs with so much lovely affection — and i’m sure i’ll be doubly touched about the comparison to me by the time i listen to the album in full. wow, i really don’t know why i haven’t checked it out yet. i listened to 대취타 and eight with iu that month but not d-2 as a whole. huh. <br><br>and i did, actually! briefly when i was a teenager, and to this day, some of the only k-choreos i retain from my dancer days are no more dream, we are bulletproof, 상남자, 하루만 and maybe the chorus to 호르몬 전쟁. something about muscle memory never forgetting what gave it the most pain and grief. but then i went to uni, and only fell back in to peak around 봄날? so i’d say wings era-ish, which is another great album overall &amp; was formative in retrospect to my own writing in its own small, indistinct ways. it’s been a lot quieter on my end since, though ofc i salute them every time i see news of them thriving. that said, i was never really part of the army community, even back when it was a bit smaller, so maybe that kind of invalidates me in a way? i don’t know. i certainly don’t wanna step on any spaces or toes i shouldn’t. you got it pinpoint right, though, about yoongi! the man who slapped me across the face in one verse in the last and sent me running to therapy for the first time. &amp; seokjin’s not very far behind him as well.</div>

 <div class=reply>THIS COULD NOT HAVE COME WITH MORE PERFECT TIMING. WRITING IS GOING NOWHERE AND I AM THRILLED TO HAVE SUCH A GOOD EXCUSE TO ABANDON IT FOR TONIGHT. <br><br>i don’t think i’ve talked about the goldfinch since my hs english teacher, oh my god. i sought it out myself after it won the pulitzer in 2014; i already read the secret history, which i actually have a lot of friendly thoughts about even though i reserve them for specific people in this current wave of dark academia &amp; all that overdistillation that the kids are doing — which, i know i sound bitter &amp; old, and i am, but that’s another rant about my problems with dark academia as a whole &amp; how it so often misunderstands tsh — anyway, my teacher said i’d like the goldfinch if i liked the prose of tsh, and bc it was such a long book, i thought why not let it consume me? it didn’t take me long to read at all, though, i don’t think, mostly bc i was sucked in from the first line (still one of my fav opening sentences ever) and by the time i got to las vegas, boris became like this renewed spark of energy that had me reading on the bus, even in the shower. but my general thoughts are that the goldfinch is still reflective of the same things that i can pick at in tartt’s writing, but without the satirical, near comedic tone that tsh has; it has this sort of old-fashioned, capital r Romantic sensibility, in terms of art &amp; its place in the world of the narrative, but that also means it tends to skew towards very anglo-saxon elitism &amp; old-timey romanticization that is relatively untouched by politics. that said, it still sells those vibes very, very well, and i think the reason that the world feels so organic and not at all like an 800-page trek is that a) it moves seamlessly through the different points of theo’s life by literally moving to different richly drawn settings while b) still remaining grounded in theo’s grief over his mother. imo the best way to read the goldfinch is as a study of the aftermath of unexpected, irrational tragedy, one that theo carries quite literally in the form of the painting. the book doesn’t Just feel like it’s held together by concepts and themes and ideas; instead, they flit in and out of theo’s life as his rs with grief and the painting changes, and i think that’s why the final sections of the book hit me so hard. it’s a final love letter. it’s the finale to this dickens-like bildungsroman that we’ve seen unfold over years, from downtown new york to all the dr*gs and mess in las vegas and then all the characters from theo’s childhood returning as adults in the two final sections — oh, now i want to reread it. thank you so much for saying it screams me :( <br><br>running out of space but fav character is boris! i can talk about him for a whole other cc answer! &amp; some fav quotes are the goodbye bus scene at the end of the las vegas section + the whole end section esp the one about “laughing into the holy rage” !!</div>

 <div class=reply>intj has been my most common result, with intp in second place! i admit i'm not the most sold on mbti as a personality test for myself personally, at least not the way that i feel more known by my enneagram type for example, but the stats always teeter with nearly equal percentages split between judging and prospecting traits, with just a tad bit more recurrences for intj.</div>

 <div class=reply>how nice of you to remember that tweet! all my love to you as well 😊<br><br>i was very much a hallyu wave 2.0 kid, so i’d say around 2007-2008 is when i first got into it through exposure to that time frame in the mid 2010s when groups like wonder girls, suju and snsd were on the radio internationally. but it hadn’t been — like, all out being a fan, so much as being more aware of that sphere of media? &amp; it wasn’t until i got into shinee when they debuted that i considered following a group closely; even then, it took until maybe the ring ding dong era, where they were doing this variety show called hello baby, that i really crossed over into full-time keeping up with what the idol world is doing. i won’t say i’ve ever been a dedicated fan the way that stan twt collectively functions, bc i’ve never really been an overly active content creator / consumer beyond songs, choreo &amp; variety shows, but with that in mind, it also meant that i was kinda just heaping all sorts of food into my plate from the buffet table without isolating the ones i really like. so i was very much present and plugged in when big groups like exo and bts first debuted, but also very much present and plugged in to watch the more tragic history of groups like b.a.p and boyfriend. since i started being conscious of k-pop, i don’t think i ever really stopped, even at times when i wasn’t focusing solely on one group, so it’s really more of just standing in the periphery of this thing i know a lot about and may have many opinions about but i’m also not IN the community enough to do much more — if that makes sense? <br><br>that said, the first k-pop concert i ever went to was shinee, just a few months before jonghyun passed away, and there’s a long personal story there that i’m mentioning to you here bc i blame it directly for spiralling into got7 that same year. like — really, really spiral. there is no idol group i know better than i do every part of got7’s career, for better or often for worse. a more astute observer would say that i worked through my grief over jonghyun through got7, bc their group chemistry was very much an echo of shinee to me, and to this day, they are the only ones to sort of parallel the level of emotion i poured into shinee. i saw them three times in concert, the last one knowing it will be the last i’ll see them before they disband. and i think in that, it was also my official goodbye to my more devoted k-pop days. there’s a very clear, clean end to my time and therefore my grief with both groups, i think.<br><br>i’m running out of space &amp; can’t list all my fav songs but two of my fav albums from idols specifically are verse 2 by jj project and the agust d mixtape by bts’ yoongi. other than that, while i still keep track of older boy groups in the industry like svt and even skz, i mostly enjoy girl groups from this newer gen of idols + whatever i’m led to through other adjacent music genres like k-indie and krnb.</div>

 <div class=reply>i love the opening of this cc! i should use this in my own life. not i hope you’re doing well or i hope this finds you well, but i hope you are in good condition. that’s really neat. i am in good condition, thank you, even if i may not always be well. i hope you are, too.<br><br>and no, i don’t really watch many kdramas these days? the only kdramas i’ve watched recently are hometown cha cha cha, hospital playlist, youth of may and nevertheless, none of which i’ve finished yet, but the first two i definitely will at some point bc i did enjoy them a lot. i also recommend that you check them out if you haven’t bc i’ve heard good things about the parts i haven’t gotten to yet. <br><br>as for any series i recommend, my fav kdrama of all time is probably school 2013. it’s not very romance-oriented, unless you read the main friendship that way, but it leans towards the sort of slice of life, coming of age struggles that i think inform what i like in stories now that i’m much older than the age i was when i watched it. i haven’t rewatched it — i tried to a few months ago but it made me feel so much in the first ep alone that i had to stop — but if it still holds up to everything i loved about it before, you can expect well fleshed out characters and good if at times dramatic handling of very real themes that students experience as a result of home life or uncertainty and resignation about the future, as well as the difference that a good adult figure can make in one young person’s life. it might be a rough start, especially since the drama is so old by now, but i promise you it pays off. or at least i think so?<br><br>and i know the third installment of the reply series is the most popular, but another kdrama i really loved around the same time as school 2013 was reply 1997. it delves into the fan culture in south korea in the 90s, in a manner of speaking, and i just really enjoyed seeing that explored through two timelines: our characters in high school, at the height of their teenage love for their idols, then to adulthood, older though not much wiser, but still the product of what they loved as a teen. <br><br>(also, if you want a quick watch, i remember being pleasantly surprised by a three-episode drama special called page turner!) <br><br>anyway. thanks for this question. i haven’t really thought about why those two are my fav kdramas of all time so far, but this coaxed me into thinking about it and articulating the reasons 😊 i hope these suffice and if you check any of these dramas out, i hope you like them.</div>

 <div class=reply>everything about this is more than alright and not at all troublesome, please, oh my goodness. i’m trying to string together my thoughts about this song bc gentle and lovely feel rote and not precise enough to pinpoint the, like, soft melancholy of it? i don’t know, it’s 3 AM here and my brain is struggling from sleep meds but — it’s such a beautiful, beautiful song made even more so by the translations i’m reading in the comments, and i am so warmed by the idea that my writing reminds you of this song. thank you so much for sharing this with me 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>bypassed a couple ccs to get to this bc i laughed so loud — no, i live with one other person! they're not often home during the day plus they're an early to bed, early to rise kind of guy, but this means that while there were no witnesses to my 2AM scuttling, i also had to be extra quiet and extra stealthy to ensure it. which is very hard to do when the goods are in a huge, crinkly bag that echoes across the whole place every time i dig in for another handful. did it stop me, though? no 😔</div>

 <div class=question>do you know this photographer Rinko Kawauchi? Do take a look at her works because I feel like you'd enjoy them. I just wanted to say how her photos and your writings carry very similar emotions in my head. It’s raw and bittersweet nostalgia that can put a light smile on my face, and unravel a sort of tightness in my chest. Just wanted to thank you for your writings—they’re precious words. Hope you’re having a nice time.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my god, i tweeted about how nice your cc made me feel and never even got around to replying last night. not only do i know rinko kawauchi, but love doesn’t even begin to cover how i feel about her work. you’re incredibly on the mark there with thinking i’d enjoy them; i got her book ametsuchi as a birthdays gift many, many moons ago, and since then, she (and vivian maier) have been the only answers i can think of any time someone asks me who my fav photographer is. <br><br>i think you describe it so beautifully and precisely, calling it raw and bittersweet nostalgia that still manages to unravel the tightness in your chest, but i will also add that something i love about her photos is how vaguely imperfect they are. i know, logically, that every photo was taken with composition in mind, as with any art form, but every time i see her photos and the way that some are a little skewed, a little under or overexposed, a little vignetted, it always strikes me what an apt, irreplaceable capture it is of the moment. and she always photographs small, ordinary things! yet in being taken, the object becomes a photo that has so much transparency, so much transience. like something you want to look at for so long that eventually you start seeing through it and find your own reflection on the other side? i don’t know. i can’t describe how art makes me feel, least of all the technical good-ness of the art itself, but i know what you mean. i really do. <br><br>that’s why it means all the more to me that you would think of my writing at all in connection to hers. it’s one thing, i think, when someone is being kind about my work maybe making them happy, or my work making them realize something about their mentality, but it’s another altogether to receive a message like this that boils it down to feeling, to the nostalgia and the unravelling, not to mention doing so in connection to an artist i love. it makes my heart so warm and tight and i’m just very, very touched. thank you so much and i also hope you are having the nicest time possible.</div>

 <div class=question>Hello. I hope this isn't bothersome, and it's moreso on a whim I wanted to write this- its truely something you aren't obliged to read, much less reply to. I deeply love your writings, i think, more than I'm able to express. Unlike you, I'm not all that good with words, and any expressions I have are fumbling and clumsy at best, and confusing and lengthy at worst. (I'm afraid I'm fumbling even now for how and what to say, even though I made up my mind about saying something, at least.) <br>I enjoy how much emotion your writings hold. Reading your newsletters especially, (although your fics hold the same visceral rawness), feels honest, and- for lack of a better, deeper word, relatable. I think you put feelings and thoughts into words, and usually after reading what you write i find that, now, I can figure out my own feelings through your verbalization- and I come out of your works with a little bit of self discovery. I'm sure that's embarrassing, and I hope it doesn't come across as creepy or reaching. Even more embarrassing, I think your fic- (first love late spring), helped me figure out that, maybe, I wasn't ready for love, and to verbalize the issues I was finding in the relationship I held then. Hm, I suppose that's too bitterly honest, and if you're still reading, I apologize, but the veil of both anonymity and my need for honest admission is making my lips a bit loose.<br>Regardless, I wanted to thank you for putting your works, and thoughts, into the world. What you say and write, however trivial, is valuable, and I think I both want to; 1) praise you for how beautiful your prose is, and 2) thank you for what I've been able to find in your works. I hope you have a wonderful day, night, week, year- and if you made it this far, thank you for indulging me, and thank you for what you do.</div>

 <div class=reply>no way at all that this could ever be bothersome, oh my god. i think you’re plenty, plenty good with words, and what might be fumbling or confusing to you is heartfelt and genuine to me. it’s funny bc i think often we feel like our words are lacking for the emotions we feel, but then it reaches another person and it makes just the perfect amount of sense that it needs to. and i think that’s what’s happening here, bc i am nothing short of immensely grateful that you took the time to word all of these thoughts and feelings to me and send it in. i always use the word honour to describe how it feels to hear things like this about my writing, but that feels almost distant, or hierarchical for what i mean. bc really i’m just grateful, period, to be one of those lucky writers out there whose words are not left to dangle alone in the void without reaching another person, another mind, another heart. i’m really, really glad my words could be something to you, and the self you’re still discovering. and hey — you never have to apologize for being honest here, least of all to me. god knows i rant and rant and rant with little care 😅 thank You for this, for indulging Me, and i also wish you a wonderful day, night, week, year.</div>

 <div class=reply>cw / mental health &amp; psychiatry (for anyone passing by)<br><br>no, it’s okay! but how specific are we talking… like, name of the clinics and hospitals i’ve been to? bc of course i don’t think i can disclose that on here, although i won’t mind including more detail maybe in a private message. but if you meant something just a little bit broader in terms of what i’ve had done, in a manner of speaking, then i started in a mental health &amp; substance abuse program for youth and then essentially got referred and transferred first to a CBT program for social anxiety, then i started my first year on antidepressants &amp; antipsychotics, moved to a depression CBT group, then did CAMS for a bit, went back on meds, went off it and was hospitalized, got back on meds and now i am in a DBT program and will be starting a group for PTSD sometime soon. i know that’s like a whole mouthful, sorry, but covering my bases here in case this is what you meant about where i went for therapy. again, if you meant the names of the doctors and clinics, then legally, i can’t disclose that, i don’t think, but if you want to message me, i can point to the general vicinity of where members of my care team are located, in a sense? but yeah. let me know 😊</div>

 <div class=question>i just started watching blue period after seeing your praise for it! i can guess that the direction is, a lot about art and, i don't know if you've ever come across nerdwriter1 on youtube? their channel is i think one of the largest that are videoessay based, and i do recommend a lot of their art theory and art history videos (if you havent seen them already). lots of love &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>i used to be subscribed to nerdwriter1 in high school and my early uni years! but to put it mildly, i think i just outgrew their style and their takes, kind of? so some time ago, i stopped watching bc their videos always left me feeling a certain kind way and eventually, i unsubscribed altogether. which happens with a bunch of things all the time. all it comes down is personal preference, i think, especially in a field i consider as personal to each person as art theory and art history; i am still very thankful you thought to leave me a message about their channel 🤍<br><br>and it’s even nicer to hear you’ve checked out blue period! you say watching, though, so i assume you mean exclusively the anime? i’m not caught up with it yet, but let me take this chance to champion the manga as a rather different experience to the anime altogether. i think it’s one of those stories that was designed so well and particularly for the format it originates in. while i am of course happy that it’s getting bigger and being adapted to an anime and a stage play, i am still first and foremost a massive fan of the specific storytelling in the manga, so i want to raise a thumbs up in its direction if you ever have time. thank you for dropping by, sai 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>THE WAY THAT A FRIEND AND I WERE WHEEZING OVER THE EMPHASIS ON GREAT TITLE. i really am not inclined towards pettiness about that confusing situation at all, even though i am an incredibly petty person by nature, but you truly made my night then. i should still say, though, that i do take my titles from other people’s great work and owe this one to corpse song by margaret atwood. the line goes “i exist in two places / here and where you are / your song is mine.” and that felt so representative of megumi in that fic. <br><br>anyway, i appreciate hearing here and where you are described as comforting! someone left a really lovely bookmark some time back that i can’t recall verbatim, but it was a very gentle picture and at the same time so at odds with how many of the comments i get on that fic involve some requisite fist-shaking. which is absolutely valid. i knew the premise was a specific sort of heartbreaking off the get-go. but that’s why i’m all the more thankful for thoughts like yours, and the lens you see it through, as a bittersweet study of grief. i love thinking of it like that as well. i always teeter on where i stand on that fic as a whole, but i also know it has some of the most complicated push-and-pull emotion i’ve tried to write, and i owe that to how much grief is at its core, and how much love that amount of grief reveals. thank you so much.</div>

 <div class=reply>i may have deleted the weepy late night tweets that i Know prompted this cc, but there is no way i will overlook what an incredibly thoughtful gesture this is of you. thank you, my dear. thank you so much. you are so very sweet and there is so much joy in this cc and you are not presumptuous at all and i just — there is so much sweetness distilled here that i can’t even maintain my usual dry tone in replying. it’s not quite like being known, everything you said here, bc that would imply that i think all of these are true, but at the same time, the idea that you see me in your tl and think all these kind thoughts about me is so overwhelmingly nice a concept that i don’t even know what to do with it. which is a good thing. a good, good thing, and you are a good, good person for this good, good message. i hope you have a goddamn amazing, spectacular forever.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh man, i have a couple cc answers here somewhere about characterization, i think, but i don’t even know how to start looking for them. off the bat, though, i empathize with you very much; i know how tough that first time writing a pairing always is, especially when you love them so much, so for what it’s worth, i am with you.<br><br>i don’t know if i have any universal tips, necessarily, but one thing i can appreciate about the way that my character work has changed over the years is that i went from relying solely on introspection and exposition — meaning i used to start off my fics by describing what a character is like, kind of just giving the reader a thesis statement for the rest of the story — to now depending on reaction to drive character choices. so if there are any tips for me to give, and is also a handy idea to keep in mind if you find yourself stuck in writing, it’s that a character always has a choice to make + the reason why they will make the choice they do. often, i rely on canon material where this same thought applies, and that’s how i get to know a character. i think. i’ve never articulated this before but — yes. give your characters choices, whether it’s just following a person to another room or choosing to kiss someone, and consider why they chose what they did, in everything from whether they have a complicated relationship with their sister to them maybe just wanting fresh air. and i think that’s where recognizability is rooted in; even if you put these characters in a world wildly different from their canon universe, if they make choices that make sense to who they are fundamentally, then the hope is that fellow readers will see that and recognize them for that. which is, come to think of it, probably the critical part about writing fics in particular.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my god, no, please, i love getting unexpected but pleasantly straightforward questions like this. technically, though — no, i don’t like math. i was a kumon kid for basically half a decade, and i did well because you had to do well under a tutoring regimen like that, no exceptions ever, but also my take is that if i was actually any good at math, i wouldn’t have been in the kumon program at all, would i? i’m just not very mathematically-inclined at all, i think, and a few people have said it’s because i’m genuinely scared of it and that fear was exacerbated by unfriendly teachers overtime, but i don’t know. the only thing i retain from my kumon training is being really good and quick at mental arithmetic. that is it. absolutely nothing else. if you wanted me to do algebra or calculus or trigonometry, you’ll have to teach me from scratch again bc i wiped it all as soon as i didn’t have to do them for school anymore. so many of my career aspirations i had to abandon because i see any numbers at all and my mind goes blank. that’s why you’ll see me often spelling out numbers; it helps me actually register them. otherwise, it’s nothing. zero. i can multiply anything for you but that’s more a party trick for the enjoyment of inebriated people. <br><br>but you know, i think math is extremely beautiful. i know that when i used to get it, i found it exhilarating like nothing else. also, is there anything prettier than a full, finished formula covering every space there is to write? and conceptual, theoretical math is so wonderful! there’s so much beauty and perfection in it and the things you can do with it — architecture, physics, game theory, all these things i would have loved to do if i was any good at math. but i am not. so the technical answer is no, i don’t like math. i don’t like it, even though i know that in another life, i would have been happy loving it. that sort of paradoxical thing? i don’t know.</div>

 <div class=reply>OOF. TOUGH JOB. i don’t think it’s a Here Are The Top Ten Poems You Should Know type of thing, in the sense that i don’t believe that’s the approach anyone should have for something so broad… if you know what i mean. the same way that it will be tough to answer a question like, “any food recommendations for someone just getting into eating?” which i — as someone who doesn’t know you personally and as such has no idea if you prefer sweet over savory, appetizers to full meals, pasta to rice, cream soups or broths, if you’re allergic to anything, what your spice tolerance is like — am left not quite sure how to answer. and this isn’t me frowning at you, i promise! more so that i am prefacing that i’m not sure how to answer this question and will likely fail with what the response i end up giving. <br><br>that said. hmm. i wonder how to go about this. i think i’ll give you a few poems. they’ll all be about love (ish), to narrow down the list for me, yes, but also to hopefully help you contextualize them as you read, just so that there’s some foundation for you to maybe figure out what you like or don’t like in poetry, or if you have an inclination towards the form and rhyming tradition in a certain time period, all that stuff. if that makes sense. <br><br>i’ll start you off with the ancient roman poet ovid, translated here by christopher marlowe in rhyming couplets: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50470/either-she-was-foul-or-her-attire-was-bad <br><br>a bit farther down in time, to a shakespearean sonnet: https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/shakespeares-sonnets/sonnet-31/<br><br>another shakespearean sonnet in its traditional form, but by the romanticism era poet keats: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44468/bright-star-would-i-were-stedfast-as-thou-art<br><br>then skipping way over to the beat generation, who didn’t write as much anymore about love per se, but here’s a fav from diane di prima: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54975/an-exercise-in-love<br><br>and then three examples of contemporary poetry:<br><br>two from ada limón, the second of which never fails to leave me feral: http://www.buenosairesreview.org/2015/02/ada-limon/<br><br>and richard siken: https://genius.com/Richard-siken-planet-of-love-annotated<br><br>i skipped a good many years in the middle there, but my mind’s turning up blank at the moment, i’m sorry 😅 all of these are very western, too, and of course one poet’s work about love may not always reflect the other poems they wrote in their lifetime. but again, to contextualize them for you, there are overlapping themes among all these poems, but approached in ways that i feel are emblematic of the poetry written within that one generation. <br><br>but honestly, listen, if you want to jump right in waist-deep into a collection, anything by mary oliver or louise gluck is both beautiful and very accessible.</div>

 <div class=question>hello &lt;33 let me preface this by saying that i have read and loved many of your works on ao3, from the older bnha ones to flls, and i am consistently in awe of your way with words; there's this incredible softness in everything you write. it's always very accomplished and makes me /think/ but it's also very gentle, and i love that. i'm privileged to be able to see the world through your lens, if only for a few hours - it's lovely every time! <br><br>but that's not what i'm here to talk about. i'm here because i read the second instalment of your newsletter, and i absolutely needed to tell you just how much it resonated with me. i find myself thinking about kindness a lot, especially with relation to how privileged i myself am, and how i've never gone through any big hurt or suffering or anything - it feels a bit presumptuous, almost, to talk of being kind under such circumstances. it also feels incredibly foolish and near impossible, when you look at the way the world is sometimes. <br><br>but - and this is where your letter (calling it a newsletter when it's addressed to a 'dearest friend' feels somewhat like an injustice!) became this revelation - i also find myself wanting to believe in humanity's inherent capacity to understand each other. it's really, really strange, because the words i read today are words i've said verbatim to myself over and over again before: 'i refuse.' i find myself saying that a lot, when i think about goodness and the world at large, so you can imagine the surprise and joy and kinship i felt on seeing that someone else felt exactly the way i did. more than that - on seeing that someone has somehow pulled every stray nebulous thought i've ever felt on the subject but never managed to properly put into words, and written them into something so perfect it felt like you were holding up a mirror that reflected my entire soul back to me crystal clear. and i cannot tell you what that means to me. i really cannot. <br><br>so thank you very, very much for writing and sharing your letters with us. i'm going to try to believe in goodness, too, in my own and others', and capacity and possibility and hope and sunrises and unexpected visitors. it'll be hard, and i'll try anyway, because that's all i can do. this is absurdly long already, and i really hope you don't mind, but reading that letter today gave me the strangest, most exhilarating jolt, the kind you only get when you feel /known/ on a deep and primordial level, and i just had to let you know. i hope november is kind to you, and i hope there are many small moments which make you happy, and warm beds and cool pillows and favourite drinks. all my love &lt;333</div>

 <div class=reply>oh dear, you have struck all the top adjectives that get to me without fail, but you also emphasized one that i am hearing for the first time in this context (“accomplished”) and so i am wringing my hands trying to be less flustered as i type this even though you have such a wonderful forthright way to your generous compliments that there’s nowhere for me to hide. <br><br>i’m afraid i don’t have words in me tonight so much as emotions that i can’t very well pack up and send over to you, but really, truly, unbelievably, thank you so much for being such a kind, thoughtful reader. to think that you were reading even my older fics and now you’re reading the newsletter, too — and that they generate thoughts for you the way i can only hope they do in any person reading on the other side — there’s a sense of a conversation being completed, to some degree, especially in light of how you took the time to come on here to leave this lovely message. because i think interactions like this, or maybe just in particular the shape that they take in my own personal life, prove exactly what you’re echoing back to me here. that there might be an inherent capacity in human beings to understand each other. that no, of course there is no universal experience and each of us are the sum of different parts no matter the things that we might hold similar to one another, but there is still this… language? in a way? that we all tap into when we talk to each other like this. or rather, a capacity for that language. because like — i have my own experiences, you have yours, we had different paths that led us to the emotions and thoughts we have now, and from here on out, we’ll tread different routes towards all the other experiences we will have, but my words were yours, if only for a moment, if only for that brief overlap, and that has to be something i want to believe is inherent to many of us. that we can be reflections and extensions of each other, even as stranger to stranger through a screen like this. you know? <br><br>and so, to say what i’m feeling more concisely about this whole thing, i’ll reverse our roles a little and use your words to articulate my emotions this time, because this? this whole exchange? to me, it also “...felt like you were holding up a mirror that reflected my entire soul back to me crystal clear. and i cannot tell you what that means to me. i really cannot.” <br><br>thank you for reading and writing to me. i’m thankful for any kind message i get but this one in particular was especially touching and exhilarating in equal measure. i wish you all the small moments to make you happy as well. all my love, my friend 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>three or four or ten part, i may not reply on time but i will always welcome it and get around to it, i promise. first off — as much as anything can be first in about my third reply to you in a row now — happy, happy belated birthday. second, to hell with that, i have a kobo myself and bought $90 worth of books yesterday because of black friday sales, so i am enabling your purchase as well to absolve myself. but also — it was on your birthday! buy all the books, especially if you’re buying local! and yes, yes, yes, oh my gosh, i was so happy a couple months ago when i found ali smith’s autumn at a clothing book store — can you believe the odds? i’ve started reading autumn as well, and i hope to read each installment of her seasonal series as the seasons end and change. as ever, if you have thoughts to share, i’d love to hear them. <br><br>but also — come by whenever, if you’d like, with anything, with nothing, whatever it might be. if i don’t get to chat with you before the holidays come around, then i wish you well, well, well as we transition to a new year. and if life ever gets crowded or otherwise in such a way that you never feel like dropping by again, that’s also okay, and i’ll be wishing you all my best anyway, always. <br><br>with love in return,<br>sha 🌷</div>

 <div class=question>i don't quite know where i was trying to go with that, so let me reset by doing the introduction thing as well, as it feels kind of natural to segue this way. i don't know what name to introduce myself with - i used to go by summer, which is a direct translation of my real name that i used when i was in art school in the states, but somewhere along the way i got tired of trying to accommodate white tongues, so i went back to my real name, but it's not in the usual first-last order most are used to, so many mess it up anyway. i've also developed a paranoia to divulging personal information i never had when i was younger, so i'm reluctant to share my real name here, but i also have such a fierce protectiveness to it that i want you to know that there's that - there's me. let's just settle this for now and say my name is k. it's the first letter of my middle name(ish) - maybe another time i can tell you the whole story behind it. i grew up in a mountain city, so despite being from a tropical city i've always fared much better in the cold. i'm snobbish about how i take my coffee and personal aesthetic; am incredibly uninclined athletically but enjoy long walks nevertheless. when i was younger i wanted to be a diplomat, then a psychologist, then a social worker; now my life aspiration is to fuck off into the woods permanently, never to be seen by another soul again. but still i moved to london for another degree just this september, and now i'm just cruising along, hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. i'm very good at holding grudges and pretending that i never saw that text you sent me three days ago,, and very bad at telling my right from my left and making casual friends. nice to meet you, and i hope we'll be good - friends? very weirdly aligned pen pals wherein we talk once a month and never about the same thing but somehow it's soothing and that's the only thing that matters? i don't know, but i trust you and i will have something figured out.<br><br>and this is such a weird thing to say and include, and it seems like it comes straight out of a fanfiction or something, but i have three weeks of lectures to catch up with and i kind of really have to go, so. hey sha, don't stop writing. not like my permission should matters, but if it makes a difference - absolutely, please, you have all my permission in the world to keep working your magic, you tender, brilliant thing. know that you always have a place to be real in my mind, and i'll keep that open for you, with all the fondness i can muster, for as long as i can.

 <div class=reply>summer is a beautiful name, but with that in mind, i am certain your real name is doubly so. it’s a cliche to say truer things are more beautiful by virtue of being more honest, and i don’t know if that’s always true, but what i do know is that i’m glad you stopped accommodating white tongues to compromise your own name. names are sacred and all that, though — i want to say — not because they are inherently so, but because there is sacredness inherent to the act of being chosen. i don’t think name meanings in themselves are sacred, but when a person chooses a name, whether it is a parent for their firstborn or a godfather for their childhood best friend’s child or a person choosing a different, truer name at any point in their life — there’s sanctity in that choice, whether intended or not. there’s agency in it, however silly or superficial the name. there’s a binding that happens in the one choice. and so i think there’s a binding that happens here, too, in you choosing k. with me. <br><br>it’s funny because we were just talking about how similar we are in being truly vulnerable but i think we are so similar in all these other ways, too. from coffee to preferring the cold to the no-sports-unless-walking-is-one to holding grudges to being bad at replying to even the brief dream of being a diplomat. though while i fantasize about a life in the woods myself, i don’t know if it will be particularly sustainable for me in actuality. i think i’ll always need access to city life, if only from its periphery, because i am still a metropolitan kid at heart even if, oddly, i never have been in sensibility. i don’t know if all these similarities will make us good friends in person if we ever met, but whatever we have here works perfectly from my perspective. weirdly aligned pen pals has a nice ring to it, k. let’s stick with that for now — but like many things, a truth for which i am thankful, it is ephemeral and everchanging. <br><br>i can’t recall if i have already directly thanked you for your kindness to my writing, but there’s no such thing as saying that too much, so — thank you. for reading, for writing back. for always being so generative every time you come around. i hope all your endeavours treat you kindly, creative and academic and personal. and k. — you always have a spot here. i hope you know that.</div>

 <div class=question>hi huckleberry friend,<br><br>it's me, your corduroy friend, this time wrapped in flannel and writing from the other side of the eurasia continent. i suppose i've let your last reply to me steep in the internet void enough to warrant an update (if it's something you or the occasional visitor would care for). but i was reading your newsletter, and i was sitting on how you said you have a (questionable) ability to be truly vulnerable, and how i think we're kind of similar in that way. i remember the last time, when i mentioned something like the absence of tempering invariably makes things brittle, and you were like oh wow i needed a stretch break after that. well i kind of feel the same about your writing - so i guess this is my version of the telephone wire game. as in, we both individually sit down and try to make sense of ourselves, and in that process of untangling we hopefully inadvertently reveal something groundbreaking (or at least, stretch break-inducing) to the other. with this kind of thing it's always easier to have someone hold your hand through it, i think, even when said hand-holding is cloaked by the veil of anonymity, which makes it infinitely easier but also infinitely harder. easier, as in it's nice to transcend flesh and blood and the restriction of physicality to go and find our realness elsewhere; harder as in when i hit send and wait i'll be hit with the ineluctable "oh wait what i want isn't here, it's somewhere else and i don't even know where that is", and i think that kind of reality and the loneliness it invokes is something i'm not quite used to handling with care yet. and it's nice too, to bare yourself and to allow yourself the hope of something reciprocal, but without the pressure of having to fill expectations or at least to reply on time, which i've always been notoriously bad at.

 <div class=reply>hello, my darling friend. i busted out my own flannel to start replying to another batch of ccs, and of course you are at the top of the list. i was hoping i’d have something to offer you by the time i got around to responding, but though it’s been a few newsletters since you sent this in, i’ve yet to land on any thoughts that i feel are there to be made urgent sense of — which, you know, i think is a good thing. i spend so much energy trying to make sense of things, and maybe a therapist would say that’s a desire for control, or astrologers would say that’s my earth sign placement calling for stability, but on the contrary, i would say it’s because i know so well that things are messy and unpredictable, because i understand and accept this and operate with this as hard truth, that i want to wrangle the small things into minimalistic certitude. my breakfast routines, my phone home screen, my social media, the books i’ve read in one alphabetical pile and the books i want to read in another and the books i should donate to the library soon packed away in a stack of wine boxes. there are few things in life that are truly low maintenance, and so i cherish those few. and it is also why, i believe, i find it hard to be vulnerable. i can play at it, i can word my sentences in such a way that sounds like vulnerability, but i will know it isn’t. i will know because vulnerability is another thing i wrangle to be sparser than it is to be, in my mind, more certain. <br><br>i know that’s not particularly stretch break inducing, but it had to be said somewhere, on my part, and rare are opportunities like the ones that you and a handful of other people that drop by this inbox offer me every now and then. this opportunity that is cloaked by a veil of anonymity, to use your words, and therefore both infinitely easier and harder. with that said, though, and to address the latter half of this cc, maybe the difference between what i’m doing and true vulnerability is the same difference that exists between loneliness and solitude. at first glance, they are synonyms in a way; go deeper, reach the nuances and connotations and implications underneath, however, and they are fundamentally different. that’s what words comes down to, i think. that’s what revealing yourself comes down to. the fundamentals, and especially the ones you are willing to strip bare and expose that way without dolling it up. but then again that falls into the tendency of automatically equating rawness with depth, and i’ve sworn not to do that. <br><br>what i’m trying to say, really, is that you’re right, it is nice. this space. i’m really happy to have you here, and — i am even happier to be able to say — i’ll see you in the next one.</div>

 <div class=reply>no, hey, listen, i love random questions. like, this is not something i would have paid attention to had you not asked me this, but ever since you sent me this cc, i’ve been attentively trying to collect more info to better serve a potential answer, and i know i have been enriched by that. <br><br>i should say, however, that i’m not good at describing perfumes and cannot for the life of me tell you top notes and all of that stuff the way i might be better able to dissect wine and food and desserts 😅 a lot of what i like in fragrances, too, i find, is informed by the people i associate with them, whether bc of similar vibes or bc this is their signature scent of choice. but with all that said: i grew up around eclat d'arpege by lanvin, which my mother has worn to work the whole time i’ve known her, so there’s a lot of nostalgia i associate with the sweet fragrance of it; my brother wears f by ferragamo black &amp; lalique encre noire, the former i like for this fresh cotton kind of smell that lingers in softer fabric, and the latter, which i think he saves for more formal events, i am partial to bc it reminds me of sunday mass in colder weather, with all the wool coats and the cold metal of a wristwatch clasp. my dad was also a serial bulgari perfume wearer, though i can’t recall which ones exactly he used. on that same sunday formality vein, i also like love story by chloé, which is not what my grandmother used to wear out but smells so much like it that it doesn’t even matter. and the first perfume i ever recall noticing on another person and asking them about it is red musk by the body shop. i guess i like earthy tones on other people? i find myself paying more attention to them than sparkling, floral fragrances for sure. <br><br>that said, though, i myself go more for scents like luna by penhaligon or yvresse by ysl. as much as i like fuller, warmer, bolder scents on other people, i don’t think they go well with my general look or vibe, which is its own kind of shame, but 😐 also, if you asked me this bc you’re on the market for a scent, may i recommend trying a sample set from thin wild mercury? they’re a small business taking preorders right now, if you’re looking for something to maybe gift someone for the holidays or even just for yourself. i am realizing that i sound like i’m affiliated with them or have been sponsored so i will stop — but thank you, thank you, thank you for this super interesting question!</div>

 <div class=reply>I GIVE YOU FRANK OCEAN VIBES? YOU DIDN’T JUST DROP THAT ON ME OUT OF NOWHERE SO CASUALLY? THANK YOU SO MUCH? <br><br>but no, no, you’re right, there’s an ivy cover in the flls playlist! and oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, i feel you about rockland. somewhere in my twitter drafts is one that says, “the inexplicable chokehold that this girl’s music has on me” with a link to rockland and — ugh. and to think it was produced by aaron dessner from the national. have you listened to the full album she dropped? i still need to give it a few more listens to really cement my thoughts and feelings about it, but you said it best when you called rockland emotionally provoking. man. i don’t know what it is. like there is definitely music out there that hits me harder vocally and instrumentally, not to mention so much that’s more lyrically intricate, but every time gracie abrams drops a new song, it makes me feel such a particular way. it’s so unreal. anyway, though, thank you for thinking of me on frank ocean’s birthday and for dropping me a message about the new gracie drop. i also hope life is treating you well, sweet stranger 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi! i hope you’re doing well :) sorry if you’ve been asked this before, but do you have any advice for getting back into writing when you haven’t done it for a while? i’ve been actively trying to write for the past year-ish, after not writing since 2019, and it’s like, i just can’t make the words come out? i have so many aborted sentences and phrases in my notes app, but i can’t seem to string an actual narrative together, even though i have ideas and things i WANT to write and it is the most frustrating things ever, not being able to express what’s in my head. i feel like i might subconsciously be trying to emulate the style of fic writers i’ve been reading recently and trying to make every sentence perfect on the first keystroke and it’s stunting me. but even though i’m aware of it, i can’t seem to shake it. it’s kind of like i’ve forgotten my own voice, maybe?<br><br>you’re always so thoughtful when you talk about writing, and i don’t know if you experienced any similar feelings when you started flls after not writing for some time, but i’ll gladly take any advice (or rambling thoughts) you have ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>hello! i also hope you’re doing well, and i’m sorry for taking so long to get back to you. i am with you every step of the way, and i completely get what you mean. i agree with you as well, about all the possible reasons you listed there, and for what it’s worth — though i can’t imagine it’s especially comforting for you — i think it’s a really good sign that you’re able to isolate the habits and thoughts and instincts fuelling your stuck-ness and to interrogate them. <br><br>that said. hm. i’ve answered a couple of ccs in the past about trying to get back into a writing groove, and a lot of the stuff i offered there had to do with broader, more technical bits — but i think your situation is more specific. so. let me think. i have really only two points to offer you. for the voice predicament, i think it might be helpful to journal? i totally know how that makes me sound, but i think journaling is very helpful in getting thoughts out, stream of consciousness style, without thinking about how you’re stringing them together. just get them on the page as they come, and in doing so, the ideal outcome is that you are left with the barest, most unadorned form of your writing voice as it is right now. it might not be good, or it might be more alike to another writer’s than you’d like, but if you do it right, so to speak, journaling also generates momentum, which i find to be an underrated variable in writing. if you are the type to struggle with starting journal entries, a good rule of thumb is to start with a question — for example, what’s a good conversation you had recently, or what’s a common theme you’ve liked in recent media you consumed, both qs i’m stealing off my last job interview (haha) — and to just start without even thinking about a proper answer. if the first thought you have dates back to one unrelated memory from like three days ago, then start writing about that. just go, go, go, and circle back to the question eventually but not immediately to help ground you. as for putting ideas together into a cohesive narrative, i like to recommend reading the script for a movie or a tv show episode, preferably one you haven’t seen or haven’t rewatched in a while, and take the time to imagine the scene as you’re reading; only after you’re done with that do you go watch the final cut of the movie / show. that’s only for more drastic “i’ll do anything right now to get back into writing” moments, though. i think. it works for some, not so much for others, but i leave it with you bc of course you are welcome to it if you think it might be of use. <br><br>overall, though, you’re on the right path and just happen to be a little stuck right now, kind stranger, and i wish you all the best in all your writing endeavours.</div>

 <div class=reply>you are not hallucinating! i think i’ve tweeted a couple more times about it since you sent this cc? i can’t remember why i picked up spy x family (i think i was going through all the candidates for the manga taisho awards bc i ran out of blue period to consume last april), but god, it was such a pleasant surprise. i find that i’m always taken aback these days by how balanced so much of the media i consume is, bc i’ve gotten so used to going to different pieces for different things, you know? or more accurately, i’ve gotten a bit complacent in what i ask for from genres that have traditionally and historically not delivered the things i want. so it’s such a joy that spy x family delivers all these things that range from, say, trope-adjacent stuff like found family and fake marriage (the forgers) and obscenely rich kids with home lives that might ring empty next to the warmth of the forgers (becky &amp; damian), but it also has such a clear perception of the conventions that are prevalent in the spy and action genre, and in a lot of cases, take the time to play with them and even subvert them. which i find really cool. also, now that i’m on this train of thought, i should mention that — the first time that spy x family surprised me with its capacity for depth is when the handler was doing this spiel about the costs of war and how flawed a stance it was to be so nonchalant about thinking war and conflict necessary in any way. i just loved the quiet anger in that scene, and for it to come for her, or from anyone at all, in a series that technically belongs to a genre that doesn’t always know how to unpack trauma and all that — yeah. though at the end of the day, i think spy x family’s main strength is how comedic and full of heart it always, always is. it’s massively difficult to be that consistently funny and loving, i think, and to be so unhesitant in utilizing your characters’ ridiculous flaws + to use miscommunication in such a way that doesn’t make me want to bang my head against the wall.<br><br>anyway! fav dynamics! the forgers, easily! that’s MY family! but loid and anya’s dynamic in particular is both so funny and so heartbreaking for me and i know that if ever the time comes that i have to watch them say goodbye to each other, i will not survive it, even if they eventually reunite. outside of that unit, i also adore the academy kids, and i loved that damian is afforded generous screen time to sketch out his family background, his friendship with emile &amp; ewen, and even to be given access to genuine relationships and experience not just through interactions with our main characters. it would be so easy to leave him be, but sxf takes its time with him as it does everything else and i appreciate it. <br><br>okay, had to cut this reply down but tysm for question and i am sending you all my well wishes as well!</div>

 <div class=question>i'm a little embarassed to say this, but i wish i had found your account sooner :( this cc isn't meant to sound like i'm not content with having found you now, i'm plenty happy and plenty content. i'm honestly so honored with just being a silent follower of your works, but it would have been great if i had been a follower sooner. <br><br>the first ever work i've read from you is flls, which means i started reading late since you've written notable works for other fandoms like yuri on ice and bnha and voltron was it? anyway, i found your ao3 and your tumblr along with it. then one thing led to another, and i'm now on your twitter. you have no idea how much reading your works impacted me. i felt like there has been nothing but significant changes in my life ever since i finished flls, and i can't shake off the feeling that they happened because of you and that the very least i could do about it is thank you (which i'm getting to right now, hang on). you know how a work is so good that it inspires you to do something, anything at all? i don't know how to admit this without admitting my lowkey stalker-ish tendencies with it, but it's been like that ever since i discovered your account, and i cannot be more grateful about it. it's reached a point where reading your kind responses to other ccs and checking out your ao3 if there's an update on a new fic anytime soon (please dont think anything of this, i am not pressuring you to write and would be happier to see from your tweets that you've been doing good these days) became a habit.<br><br>anyway, i don't want to make this longer than it has to be, so i'll jump to the point: i've been reading more lately, i've been watching more lately, and i've discovered a lot of wonderful writers during my time as a follower in this account. flls, or should i say, your writing was the trigger for all these things. and i'm just so :( so so happy with how things are and how you've somehow shaped them to be.<br><br>i've also subscribed to to your newsletter, which i give my quick and honest regard to for being so warm and welcoming. i don't know what more to say, i hope all things left unsaid would be let known to you in the form of only good things. thank you so much, for writing flls and for just being yourself. i hope you enjoy the rest of the month! ❤</div>

 <div class=reply>why on earth would that be something to be embarrassed about !! if anything, it means the world that you found your way here at all, and i’m the one that’s completely honored to be regarded with as much affection as i feel in this message 🤨<br><br>with this in mind, i understand and sympathize with what you mean. but if you’ll permit me to say this, i don’t think you have anything to thank me for, nor do you have anything to regret in not “finding me sooner,” so to speak. someone once said — and i completely acknowledge that there’s no small amount of conceit in me bringing it up myself — that they felt like my fics and all that are the sort of thing you stumble upon when you need it, even years down the line, and obviously, it’s not that deep, nor does it mean that my work has some kind of inherent value just because a handful of people have been kind to me about it once, but there are still times i like thinking of it in those terms, bc to me, there’s nothing more touching than the prospect of writing a story that has taken on such a rich life beyond just mine that it could inspire another person to do something. i also think, though, that flls — or my ccs, or my account, whatever it might be — could not have inspired you or been the trigger for anything if you weren’t already so open to it, dear stranger. and nothing would have changed if you weren’t the one working hard and steady to ensure that you’re reading and watching more, that you’re discovering things in life to love. you know what i mean? so i think it’s yourself you should be applauding here, and if my writing did anything at all, it was merely a tiny spark to a powder keg that you filled up all on your own. so keep taking care of yourself, alright? keep enriching yourself, whatever that means for you. and thank you, thank you, thank you, for finding your way to flls, then to here, then to my newsletter, even if it’s on terms you consider late. i’m not the most spiritual person so i don’t know if i truly believe in the right things happening only at the right time, but if i do, this would be one of the cases that would enforce that belief. i’m really happy to hear about how you’re doing these days, and i wish you all the absolute best from here on out.</div>

 <div class=reply>my motto for fics is typically never say never! but i also don’t want to say that with the intent of making you wait or hope, bc truth be told, i also am still trying to figure out how i feel about writing more for jjk. nevertheless, it means a lot, lot, lot to hear you think so highly of flls stsg, and for what it’s worth, if i ever return to that universe, it will very likely be for them. i hope you’re having a wonderful day as well ☀️</div>

 <div class=question>hi! i hope this isn’t intrusive or anything, i’m just so curious about what else you have to recommend. i read the media recommendations you posted to tumblr, and i was wondering if you could recommend a few movies, short films, manga/animes or maybe music you’ve been listening to? I’ll appreciate anything you have to offer tbh!!</div>

 <div class=reply>not intrusive at all! though as i said in the tumblr post, i’m quite inept at keeping track of things i like and/or want to recommend 😅 that said, i’m struggling to think of any short films i’ve enjoyed recently, but on the feature length side, house of hummingbird (dir. kim bora) finally arrived on a streaming service i have access to and i was overjoyed to feel for it the exact same way i did when i first saw it three years ago, if not more. a friend also invited me out yesterday to watch tapestry (dir. takahisa zeze) in honour of the marriage announcement of the two main actors, both of whom i credit for how layered the movie ended up becoming after a relatively twee, sentimental beginning. as for animes, the only one i’m watching right now is komi-san, though i’ve been waiting for colder weather to start yuru camp and will probably get around to that soon. as for music, i’ve been playing the life out of both indigo la end and fenne lily lately. <br><br>sorry this is all over the place, but feel free to pop in any time if you want my thoughts on more specific recs, genre-wise and such. i can’t promise anything, but i’ll definitely try, if ever!</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, do not tempt me like this… i need very little convincing and i might just do it even if two people max will read it. i was toying with the idea earlier this month bc i was reading a novel where a good chunk of the chapters were these two friends sending long emails to each other, and i was just sorely missing how i used to write letters and emails to friends who live in other cities / countries. the practice kind of took a pause when we all went into lockdown, and with everything going on in our lives, we never got back around to it — and by the time i started really feeling the loss of it, it felt like i’ll just be an extra burden to everyone’s already jam-packed lives by being yet another email in inboxes that are never quite emptied of work emails to reply to, you know? <br><br>but i do miss doing it! and i bring this up bc i briefly tossed around this thought that i kinda wanted to do a newsletter type of thing to get back into the process of writing these semi-long, meandering “letters” like i would have to friends. but i don’t know. is it just another unnecessary thing i’m adding to my plate? will i end up struggling with inevitably being perceived beyond a controllable degree, considering how sentimental i would likely get in these? idk idk. but definitely it’s on my mind and i am teetering big time towards starting one, if only to try it out.</div>

 <div class=question>hi!! you recommended the “Brain Pickings” newsletter and just…thank you for that? i have been reading through the archive and it just makes me feel a lot lol. in this midweek newsletter they talked about only living once, with no rehearsal or reprise… and it reminded me of flls itafushi because they really tried their hardest, without any rehearsal. but they did have their reprise. (which i’m very happy for bc idk how my heart would have survived anything else)<br><br>i’m not sure if reprise is still the word for it, when they spent all of that time still longing and changing around each other and without each other. but the sentiment of the newsletter stuck to me: we really only live the life we live. and i wanted to use these minutes of this life i live to say thank you!! i like brain pickings and maybe it will always remind me a little bit about your writing bc it brought me to it and i’ll be glad for it!!!<br><br>also i wanted to say i once was writing an essay on the body-mind problem for my philosophy course and i thought to cite that part of flls where megumi is reading that book that says something like "how could i love your soul without a body?" bc i forgot flls was a fanfiction. i literally forgot. my brain registered it as a book i literally thought about going through my bookshelves to find it. so. i didnt end up citing fanfiction but i thought it was really funny LMAOOO 😭 please just picture that ao3 link in the footnotes of an essay and a 62 yo professor just looking at it</div>

 <div class=reply>i am so glad to hear that !!!! i’m so behind on brain pickings myself, as i am with so many things, but ahhh just hearing you talk about it makes the heart thrum. doubly so to hear the connections you make with flls itafushi :( man i really will never get over their love even long after i’ve gotten over everything else. it’s like i didn’t even write them at this point.<br><br>ALSO OH MY GOD PLEASE THAT’S SO FUNNY DKJSJH you should have told me !! that specific line is actually from an actual book !! megumi is reading a real life book !! it’s frankisstein by jeanette winterson (which, you know what, i Don’t recommend overall even though i bought it thinking it raised some good questions about body, soul, identity and desire) !! now i am sending you all the apologies in the world knowing you could have cited it !!<br><br>but no seriously, thank you so much for taking the time to send me this. i answered a couple of ccs back about how much time i took out of my schedule to write flls, and ever since, i’ve been ruminating on how many minutes of my overall life that adds up to, but in the context of this particular message, i also know that i’m content knowing i spent those minutes writing something that makes me feel as connected to other people — strangers as many of you might be — as i do reading this message. so thank you for being so sweet and hilarious and thoughtful. i’ll sleep lighter tonight knowing something i recommended had indirectly led you to something that has enriched your day to day even the smallest bit ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>REALLY !! YOUR FAV VERSION OF THEM… THAT MEANS SO MUCH ?? it’s so unreal to me that if flls was a movie, stsg’s screentime together would be like. three minutes. add their separate individual scenes to that and it would maybe still be little more than ten minutes. and yet they do feel so central to the story, every time i think about it. so much of the ✨ thematic ✨ core that i found flls having after finishing it was all thanks to stsg, and it’s so weird bc they were never something i planned to put too much focus on when i first thought about writing a college au. like yeah, i thought about them living together with a ridiculously big house in tokyo and having all these kids to look after, but to think that me getting carried away with spinning out their backstory ended up providing so much groundwork for flls itfs even though it’s all just sprinkled in one or two paragraphs here and there… it’s baffling but also ?? i cannot imagine any other approach to flls. in another timeline, i finished that prequel / spin-off for stsg in this universe and it would start with the memoir i always think of flls!geto writing. though i also love that so much of what we know about them come from fragments that we only see through flls yuuji &amp; megumi’s perspective. it feels right, too, that way. <br><br>anyway that was just a whole tangent in support of why it means so much that you’re missing flls stsg, that you’re thinking of them at all :( i love them and miss them as well! thank you for feeling things about them! seriously no greater thing to me as a writer!</div>

 <div class=reply>this question could not have come at a better time omg what nice timing !! october has been a really good month so far for me in terms of reading… i can probably get one more book in before the end of the month, but so far i’ve read beautiful world, where are you by sally rooney, if i had your face by frances cha and i am almost done real life by brandon taylor, and i have loved all three so, so much. (not to mention each of them have held a different quality that i deeply admire and want to cultivate more in my work, whatever that process ends up looking, but that’s me talking at myself. anyway.) <br><br>i completely get what you mean about not finding contemporary lit you’re interested in, though! i don’t know if you just happen to prefer other genres or if, like pre-october me, you’ve hit a reading drought as well, but the first two books i listed went by quick and easy while still leaving me a lot to chew on and love. real life is a bit denser, and so it was a slower read purely bc i have attention span problems, but it also has exactly the kind of introspection and description that i personally prefer taking into consideration when i write. if i can say that. i feel like i just committed sacrilege against brandon taylor. yikes. sorry. also, i know that sally rooney is a polarizing writer, to say the least, and i totally understand people who don’t read her novels + i think a lot of the criticism is valid in a multitude of ways, but even if you tried her previous two other books and hated them, i want to tentatively suggest giving beautiful world, where are you a shot anyway. <br><br>and yeah. let me end this by saying thank you so, so much for reading my fics and speaking so highly of them and myself :( i don’t know how much i deserve it quite yet, all these words you so generously use for me, but i am moved and grateful nevertheless. lots of love to you as well, and if you do check out any of these three books, i hope you like them! and if not, that is one hundred percent okay and i am with you on the struggle of finding books to read 😔💗</div>

 <div class=reply>yes i did know ahhhh we were robbed of more films like whisper of the heart. it haunts me to think of the films they could have made after, or what later ghibli films like the wind rises could have been under kondo's hands. but beyond that, his passing was so sudden and unexpected and he was still so young and it's all just terrible.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my goodness no no no absolutely no need to apologize, this is a completely valid question, but thank you so much for phrasing it so gently. <br><br>uhhh i think it was back in february when gege did that messy interview, and ultimately it was fine, and it’s not like i had as high hopes of jjk subverting anything as everyone else seemed to, but one thing that stood out to me and which i haven’t been able to shake off since is how akutami just doesn’t seem. to care much. about their story. and i don’t mean that they don’t work hard on it, but the tone of it all was that there was this almost. apathy. towards their own characters. i don’t feel comfortable saying outright dislike, though i’m sure there can be a case for that, but they just didn’t seem to love their characters or felt attached to the story they were telling. again, i’m not saying they don’t think hard about where they want the story to go, but that there was a palpable detachment when deciding what happens to characters and to the story. and i think it’s only gotten more prominent since, with the end of the shibuya arc and into a few arcs that are so deliberately designed to accommodate how the jjk readership have gotten so big essentially overnight. there’s a lot more focus on spectacle or tragedy in a way that doesn’t feel thematically grounded anymore, if it ever did, and a lot of the time it feels like the entire team is struggling to appease shounen readers while still also appealing to what got them to start reading them in the first place. <br><br>i think that interview just recontextualized jjk overall for me and felt at odds with how i myself felt about the characters. and once you start seeing a work like jjk from the creator’s side instead of as a reader, you can’t really switch back. not to mention so much of the convo around jjk i was seeing lacked nuance, and it only got worse by the end of the zenin clan arc and — yeah. i still do read it every time a new chapter comes out and i’ll always have a soft spot for itafushi + a few other characters + yuuji will forever be one of those characters that inject automatic serotonin straight into my veins. but. i think i had to have loved jjk an intense special way to write 133k for it during the busiest period of my life. and. i know i don’t feel that love anymore. i can talk about it at length with some people. i will watch the movie and look forward to future seasons. but the loving is completely done. <br><br>to be clear this is my perspective. i have my own biases. i hold nothing personally against strangers behind a screen and i sympathize with how hard a mangaka’s life is. but i do have my resentments as a reader and i think if anyone sat me down in front of jjk right now, i’ll pick it apart to pieces. that’s not fair nor healthy in the long run, and at the end of the day, i just willingly had to seek out other things to love before i poisoned smth further beyond repair. that’s all.</div>

 <div class=reply>whisper of the heart, easily and no question. did not even hesitate. i have seen this movie in theatres at every possible opportunity, even if i had to cross provinces or learn how to drive to get into a drive in. nothing stands between me and seiji and shizuku, even if she is now known as the lofi-girl. i cannot stress enough what this movie means to me, and how strange it is because i’m not otherwise big on ghibli. my second favourite is only yesterday, which i adore for how at home it makes me feel — it’s the type of movie that feels like a photograph of some sort of amalgamation of things i identify with, both in terms of my memories and my sentiments but also the kind of stories i dream of telling. but while only yesterday is very much the type of movie i tend to gravitate towards, it is unfortunately also very much the type of movie that studio ghibli rarely makes, if at all since. i know people love ghibli for the magic that spirited away and howl’s, for example, are imbued with — but i don’t know. i see the appeal, one hundred percent, but i’ve never identified with it quite like i have with only yesterday and whisper of the heart. <br><br>whisper of the heart, because it is a perfect, perfect balance between magic and the everyday. because the magic is IN the everyday. because their love is so pure and so rooted in the other things they love. because they love the way the other loves what they love. because so many movies capture the life of the artist but so few take the time to sit with someone on the brink of even deciding to be one and why. whisper of the heart, because you know none of this will last for them two, their relationship or the innocence of their dreams, but you can’t help but want it to. and then when that happens, you can’t help but want it for yourself as well. you want to be in the room with them, singing about country roads while the city flickers awake in the night far behind you. you want to be in that seat, when shizuku shows her writing to the shop owner for the first time. you want to be shizuku again, that kid with the overactive imagination who wanted to believe in magic so badly that you dreamt of creating a world where that was possible. and if not her, then seiji, whose dream is so simple and so complicated as not to be the best violinist in the world, but to be a violin maker so good that it could help a violinist be the best. and isn’t that so, so wonderful. i think it is. i love whisper of the heart so much. <br><br>i enjoyed kiki as well! and i went on a grave of the fireflies rant once at my last birthday party in high school 😅</div>

 <div class=reply>OH, 2 AM !! every time someone reminds of that fic it’s always a pleasant surprise and appropriately full of good vibes ☀️<br><br>recs that give off a similar feeling… i’ll go ahead and recommend the sarah dessen books that inspired 2 AM and its sister fic, if you haven’t already read them. i think it was the truth about forever and along for the ride, and if you want more restaurant consultant hijinks, what happened to goodbye is the book that inspired what bakugo’s mom does in 2 AM. i just recommend any sarah dessen if you want more of the slice of life, simple and neat story arcs that i wrote when i was doing bnha. they’re very heterosexual and suburban, which can put some people off for good reason, but i maintain that her books have been my guilty pleasure for years now bc no other author has done for me what she has in terms of vibes. except maybe melina marchetta.</div>

 <div class=question>hello!! i hope you’re well and that life is treating you kindly these days! this may be a bit personal, and feel free not to respond, but i was wondering if you have any advice or insights about dealing with failure? i don’t mean this in any way to make you feel pressured, but you just seem like someone who would give wise advice :) for a bit of context, i’m a high school student, so i guess i’m also asking for a bit of perspective? i know high school really is not where the world ends, and things that feel like they really matter now probably won’t in a few years time, but it still feels hard and all that. apologies if this cc is a bit disjointed! i hope you have a lovely day/night :)</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you, i’m very honoured that you’d come to me for something that i imagine is really important to you, though as always, i can only answer from my limited perspective.<br><br>i get the sense from the way you’ve written your cc that you are a) self-aware, b) careful with your words and the work you do and c) the type to check resources for tangible solutions. i know this is all conjecture on my part, and i could be way off the mark, but jumping off these assumptions, i also get the feeling that you’re very hard on yourself and what you might count as failure might actually be an achievement through someone else’s eyes. wherever you’re at, whatever it looks like, it takes a lot of work to get through a day, a week, a year — more work than one might think, esp if they’ve done exceptionally well and gotten far in life. and i need you to know, before i say anything else, that i can tell from the fact that you even asked me this question at all that you will be okay. you will be more than okay. know it feels hard right now, but you will be. <br><br>this all said, i guess the only thing is… i think often when we label something a failure, we consider it a done deal. we think oh well that’s done and it didn’t go well. and in doing so, we close ourselves from the possibility of turning that supposed “failure” into a stepping stone for something that most definitely is not failure. something i’ve learned to get better at over the years is understanding when a mistake — a “failure” — is inevitable, and in fact a mistake that i would have made at some point eventually, and a mistake that i’m thankful i didn’t do another time because i learned from the first one. labeling something a failure means that life is a pass or fail kind of game, and that’s not true. i’m not saying to turn every failure into a life lesson, bc some failures are small in the grand scheme of things and will get even smaller over time, but like — i think of it this way. it’s like a multiple choice math question on a test. what you consider a failure, in most cases, is really just you doing the formula on another sheet of paper and finding out that the answer you got isn’t one of the multiple choice options. that doesn’t put you out of the running. it just means you get to retrace your equation until you arrive at one of the possible choices, and even then it might not be the right answer. but that’s okay, too, bc for all that work, it is still only one question in a whole test, in a whole unit, in a whole course, in a whole school year, in a whole multi-year academic career. <br><br>i’m running out of characters but. i apologize too for my disjointed response. i wish you all the best. i hope something here was useful at all. and drop by any time if you want to chat. i wish you a lovely week 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i’ll be honest with you, i don’t know how to answer this question. not because i feel defensive or confused by it — if anything, thank you for phrasing it so delicately — but because i’m just genuinely stumped. i don’t think i have an answer at all, truth be told, and i also think that’s okay at the moment. <br><br>that also means, however, that i don’t have much to give you 😅 i don’t know if you meant this in the wider sense or if you’re asking me specifically, but the first answer to come to mind was, “be your own caregiver, first and foremost.” be kind to your inner child, be kind to the parts of you that need taking care of, be responsible with your choices as if you’re trying to protect a child’s future. yet at the same time, for a lot of people who have had to parent themselves, this has meant that they have been their own sole caretaker for a substantial period of their lives. and with that in mind, i also don’t feel comfortable telling someone who has had to take care of their own self to keep doing that, because what i really want is for someone else to take care of them for once, to let them have their peace with the inner child that never made it out or got attention when they should have, to not have to be a parent to anyone least of all to themself where an actual parent should have been. i don’t think anyone should have to Parent themself. i think someone should be able to be a child with a parent, and transition well into being an adult under that guidance and care. but that’s also very idealistic, and not the reality for a lot of people, including myself. so. once again. i really don’t have a coherent answer. <br><br>also this little spiel will be so embarrassing if that was a typo and you just meant to ask how i mentally Prepare myself. but at that point, too… for what, exactly.</div>

 <div class=reply>the particular way you’ve worded the beginning of this cc made me :( in like the best way possible… thank you so much, my heart is all tender and swollen. and it’s so sweet that you thought to leave me a cc about the video !! but yes, i tweeted about it when it first dropped but i didn’t actually get to watch it until yesterday and the wait was so worth it ❤️<br><br>and ohhh i’m not super well-versed on my tumblr dash anymore so i don’t have any immediately in mind but i know that back when i used to jump from blog to blog two of the ones i always follow first are firstfullmoon and soracities. and from there, i usually just follow who they reblog from, and so on and so forth. but if you already follow these two, and there's a good chance you do, let me know and i'll try to maybe unearth some more from my pile of unreblogged likes.</div>

 <div class=question>Hello there! I still come back to "first love, late spring" for motivation and inspiration, and I've also asked you abt a couple of things here anonymously. But if I may ask you as a non-anon to secure your answer (please take your time, and it is very understandable if you don't answer asks/qs that are not anonymous here. I just hope you're well.)<br><br>How do you manage balancing your physical and mental fatigue / exhaustion with 'resting properly' when you have/got great epiphany to write something hefty? <br>I saw that you've worked on "first love, late spring" from late December 2020 to late March 2021, and couldn't help myself to wonder about that.<br>I mean. For such a lengthy fanwork (113399 words! I still can't believe just how comfortable it is for me to read it over and over and over again, since I tend to lose focus on anything most of the time.) I'm sure you must've had days where you just - have to balance your real-life activities to actually live your life, if you know what I mean?<br><br>Um... I hope that's easy enough to be understood.... <br>Wishing you great week ahead! And take care! Stay safe, too!!!</div>

 <div class=reply>this is a really, really good question and honestly, i… don’t. or i don’t always. i have a terrible habit of overworking myself even when i don’t have to, and i’m just a lesser version of myself when i’m not breaking my back over something. in the case of first love late spring in particular, i started it in december hoping to write 20k at most, but my stories always seem to have a way of running far beyond me and making themselves longer than i have the time and energy for. it’s something i need to work on improving. <br><br>that said, i’m never not busy, so it’s not like there are any periods in my life that would be particularly optimal to write. i don’t have a lot of free time, ever, and my only choice to get anything outside of work done — socializing, writing, catching up on casual messages and shows and manga — is to also schedule those into my day. counterintuitive, i know, but unfortunately, such is life. the last three chapters of flls coincided with my deadlines for a big work project, so i think each update took me around two to three weeks, if not a month, and i had to move things in my schedule around so that i’ll have two whole days in the month to work on a chapter. sometimes this meant waking up early or staying up late. sometimes it meant working double time to get something done earlier than i should. <br><br>and like. this is unhealthy behaviour. the only reason i did all that for flls was because i was motivated by a lot of love for the story and the need to see it through, and it was time well spent bc it was time spent doing something i loved, but still. if you don’t have time for something, then you don’t have time for something. the healthy thing to do is to set your boundaries before you get sick or find yourself suffering from burnout. i’m only the way i am bc of necessity, and it’s not something i’d wish on anyone. so to answer your questions again — i don’t actually balance fatigue well with wanting to write so much as i just ignore it when i want to write. and that’s not a good thing. i’m well aware of that. that said, the closest you can get to balance probably relies on time management, and also not forcing yourself to do anything that will just cause you to expend more emotional labour. learn your limits and boundaries and reinforce them when you must. a lot of my fics won’t be written if i did, but i’d also be a far healthier person. and healthiness is the note i want to end this cc reply on. you take care &amp; stay safe as well 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>wait oh my gosh i’m really sorry, i’m on the slow side today — do you mean how i formatted my tumblr? or my carrd? if you mean my sleeptowns blog, it’s the vito theme by nouvae and i changed every part of the html code that governs the font family into helvetica and/or serif. if it helps, you can “view page source” on that tumblr page and see a good chunk of the coding. <br><br>i know that’s not very specific, but i figure i’d start broad in case this isn’t what you were asking about. please let me know if i’m answering to the wrong q altogether 😅</div>

 <div class=question>tips on how to get over writing slump? (getting stuck in a scene, dialogue, etc. some practical ones for both technique and mentality would help loads! ❣️)</div>

 <div class=reply>i know it’s not exactly the same thing as a slump, but i answered a cc months and months ago on being stuck in writing: https://curiouscat.qa/sleeptowns/post/1197960478<br><br>in addition to what i said back then, one tiny thing that has worked for me is reading outside of the medium that i write. so if i’m writing prose fiction, i’ll read some poetry or some articles or some screenplays, just to get some sort of word flow going. it sounds bad but you don’t even need to absorb what’s happening so much as kinda just. unclogging a frozen sink with hot water. another small thing is changing the logistics of how i write. maybe i’ll move from the laptop to handwriting a story, or vice versa. and also, if you’re struggling to get any words out at all, it has helped me loads to handwrite a journal entry. it doesn’t have to be anything specific about you or what you’re writing, just something that you can ramble about without interrogating every word and every sentence. doesn’t matter if it’s crap or doesn’t make sense; a lot of the time, a writing slump is on the word level, that first stage, and not the thinking that strings those words together into a full narrative. if it IS a narrative kind of slump, though, watching films and/or video essays have helped a ton to get the brainstorming going!<br><br>all in all, i’m sorry to hear you’re struggling to write… i know how much that sucks and how impossible it can feel to get un-stuck. i wish you all the best and i hope at least one of the things in the cc i linked or the suggestions above can be of help. if not, always feel free to drop by and we can talk things out in more specifics if you’d like !!</div>

 <div class=question>okay hi, so I'm back again. i've also been wondering if you could name a few authors on ao3 who you look up to? it's just that i've seen your style of writing so rarely, that i wonder where you pick it up from. otherwise, i'd just like to scour and dig up some good fics to read. on that note, flls' beginning with the newsletter reminded me oddly of Kimi no Na Wa (your name), which if you don't know, is an anime on the red string of fate concept. have you ever considered doing something like that? writing the characters of one anime into the dynamic or universe of another one. <br><br>otherwise, i think that's all for now. thank you for reading and i wish you the best till the next time we interact. best, mira.</div>

 <div class=reply>OKAY I’M ALSO BACK. this is a really good question hmm i actually don’t read a lot of fic? i read like three to five a year, maybe, if that. it’s funny you say this, too, bc it’s only recently that people have started talking about my “style” and up until now i didn’t realize i had a noticeable one? and i certainly don’t know where i picked it up from. like… what is it about my writing. is it maybe bc i write a bit more memoir-ish? introspection and such? i do wish my writing was more stylistic. or at least prettier. a solid kind of beautiful instead of just atmospheric, which i get a lot and am really grateful for but it makes it a bit trickier to answer questions like this bc i really have no idea what i’m trying to emulate in my writing, i’m sorry. <br><br>if it would be any help, though, some authors i have bookmarked on ao3 are: younglegends, ilgaksu, fathomfive, shonens, themorninglark, strikinglight. for all of them, i’ve only read one or two works from one fandom, but the first four authors have at least one of my all time fav stories even beyond fic.<br><br>of course i know kimi no na wa !! i admit i’m not the biggest on fate tropes / concepts, but it’s definitely something i’m open to trying. i saw a post on tumblr the other day about soulmates — or at least being bound to another person with a red string or something along those lines — being suffocating and claustrophobic, a noose around your neck, instead of the traditionally romantic view of it, and since i mentioned my love for dysfunctional relationships in my last reply to you, i feel compelled to mention it here now too bc i think combining the two would be super interesting. i’m putting it down somewhere as soon as i send this reply. and yes, i’ve actually done a couple anime-to-anime transplant fics, though never for jjk.<br><br>on that note, the longer i let this answer go on for the weirder it’ll probably get so i’ll cut myself off here. thank you so much for taking the time to drop by and send me such long, thoughtful ccs, mira. i hope you have a good rest of october &lt;3</div>

 <div class=question>heyy sha! i write to you because 1. i've finally read your response to my second CC and gah, I'm so happy to be able to admit that kghn is my favourite pairing in haikyuu too 2. i've been met with an epiphany last night while i was watching the stars from my window. first, to reply to your reply, i'm so happy to hear that there's someone else out there who appreciates the haikyuu platonic pairings. even beyond the romantic ships, i feel that there's so much room to work around with just the friendships - like kuroo and bokuto who might as well be platonic soulmates or hinata and yachi, who i think, would probably be friends for life. <br><br>moving on, i'd like to pose a question, if you don't mind: what's a quote you live by? or what're those few words that could be so simple but they continually resonate with you daily? one of my personal favourites is "you can fly even higher", which i'm sure is from haikyuu (expectedly). additionally, what are your thoughts on emotionally-detached relationships? case example: scum's wish, where both leads date because they're in love with someone else + need an outlet to project their desires onto or bloom into you where both female leads have feelings for each other but prefer it if the other didn't reciprocate. <br><br>right, before this message gets too long, i'd like to mention this idea which dawned on me last night when i was trying to get some sleep. it's basically a hospital au, probably stolen from an anime I've watched whose name i won't remember (my friend's writing this one fanfiction where she puts her favourite pairing in a weathering with you au, that's probably where this mish-mash of ideas cane from) where megumi's a doctor and yuuji's that one happy-go-lucky patient. well, it could work the same way if they're both patients, the point's that it's mutually-dependent and they're both using each other as a way to get over. i've always just imagined themselves in this position where they're in a room with white walls and there's people passing them but they're the only two in focus, looking at either one of them but neither of them fully realise because of the crowd. in this au, maybe, i was thinking that megumi's this insufferable doctor who's trying to get over the monotony of his life, and he hasn't exactly known love until he met yuuji. yuuji's the same, always seeking love but never finding it and never knowing why, until he finds himself down with a chronic illness with permanently cuts off his chances of reaching the end of his endeavours in love. there's no real end to this but maybe they fall in love and one of them has to go, but yuuji's happy because he found what he sought for and megumi just wishes he could be selfless enough to share his happiness with him too. <br><br>also, spare me a minute, i'm gonna run to do something and then I'll be back to send a follow-up cc. thank you for reading this and putting up with my word-dump &lt;3 - mira.</div>

 <div class=reply>you took such care to send me two separate ccs even when you had something else to do and i ended up letting it sit in my inbox for too long i’m really sorry mira :( <br><br>but yes okay lots to get to in this reply. first off, i’m nodding to what you said about hq friendships! i remember in particular when the jackals vs adlers match began and we started seeing where everyone was post timeskip, and i kept thinking to myself… man, imagine writing a cast of a hundred characters so deftly fleshed out that they all just make their own levels of sense in different combinations &amp; groups and settings. i think it’s also why i’m so picky with hq content, and why i’m so easily put off by surface level characterizations of hq characters even though i also accept logically that to each their own so long as no one’s harming anyone 😅 <br><br>moving on, i love that you had such a vivid visual and hold on the dynamics you want to portray in the au ?? i can visualize and conceptualize it so easily, that’s amazing. that said, i do think one should always be careful with settings like this, bc chronic illness is often used as sort of like. an anti-punchline. the thing that gets the waterworks going and gets emotion out. when it shouldn’t be. and with aus like this, too, there’s danger of stuffing megumi &amp; yuuji into archetypes that might not have the space to fully encompass their nuances as full-fledged characters, you know? canon megumi isn’t the way he is for no reason, for example, nor is yuuji all sunshine all the time, and even in an au with their dynamic decided for them, i’d still want that taken into consideration, and for the emotion of the story to come out of something more layered than just au yuuji passing away in the end. i’m going on a tangent, aren’t i, i started thinking about what i’d do with this story but i promise i’m hands off, just talking to myself here. are you thinking of writing this au? but whether or not you are, i want you to know that i love the full picture you’ve started with here, and the strong thematic core from the premise to the ending !!<br><br>a quote i live by is “softly, or not at all.” and yes, i love a good emotionally detached relationship! although — i never finished kuzu no honkai but i'd argue mugi &amp; hanabi aren’t emotionally detached? it so happens that their emotions weren’t invested in each other in the traditional sense, but there was investment there bc there were things at stake for both of them that kept them in the relationship. something that made the alternative more unbearable. i did love the few chapters i read specifically for how aware of dysfunctionality mugi &amp; hanabi were both in each other and in themselves. it never made for the right choices, but there’s just a lot of juice, so to speak, in emotionally dysfunctional relationships. maybe i just love relationships of convenience, whatever it may be for.<br><br>anyway i’ll see you in the next reply !!</div>

 <div class=question>nevermind this isnt morning but its like. late night rn and its been such a long day and my head is pounding but oh man i scrolled through ur cc after sending that last one and - you have such, such sweet words, and you are so generous and caring with how you handle them out. like i have a silly little smile on my face and i SWEAR my eyes are prickling because like. last year (academically, whatever) was me trying to keep it together and sort out the noise within my head and like - there was a tiny neglected part of me that wanted to write out everything cluttering my head and sort them out into these little love letters and i could do that with you because you just seem and u ARE so kind and thoughtful. and then the way you treat strangers with such welcoming familiarity and the gratitude and consideration you express towards every well wish that comes your way is just. monumental. its a type of kindness thats few and far between, and its WORKED at and thats so so admirable to me. you've never had to have been anything more than yourself, as u are right now and as you have been, to touch the hearts of so, so many people. i went through ur ccs and i was laughing because like - even i remember the megumi corduroy art school anon, and theres someone else who sends regular stuff to you, maybe more than one person, and people send you love and you thank them so doggedly - and it's a cycle i think, because you listen and pass on kindness and i know I'VE been better for it, in terms of perpetuating that care towards both myself and others. you have a really really big heart, and i mean that in the deepest and most sincere sense possible. take care. - 🧚‍♀️🌸</div>

 <div class=reply>ZI !!!!!!! IT HAD ALREADY BEEN FOREVER SINCE WE LAST SPOKE BEFORE I STRETCHED THAT OUT EVEN LONGER AND WAITED A MONTH TO REPLY TO YOU, AND DON’T GET ME WRONG, I AM OVER THE MOON TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN BUT GOD YOU SENT TWO CCS WHILE HAVING WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A TERRIBLE HEADACHE AND AS A SEMI RESPONSIBLE ADULT I MUST CLUCK AT YOU IN DISAPPROVAL <br><br>that said, i hope it’s alright that i’m replying to both in one. it is so, so good to see you back in my inbox, and to a degree i am glad i waited a bit before replying. i got your messages while holding back tears at an overpriced all you can eat sushi place, which is a pretty apt summation of how i was just not in the best shape nor the best environment throughout august and september and would not have been the best person to be interacting with anyone, truth be told, much less responding to such a lovely cc from you, whom i have sorely missed receiving messages from. but i am working at getting better, slowly but surely, and in more ways than one i have been carving away at a new version of myself. i am not that version yet, but eventually, i will be. <br><br>still, i have my reasons why i’m responding to this cc instead of the previous one. mostly i’m just struck to be on the receiving end of your open-hearted kindness, which is what i think my slow progress at getting better has been founded upon. like — you say such nice, generous things about me and i am publishing it bc i want to keep it forever, but i also just really love what you said about the idea of kindness being passed on. it’s impossible to be kind all the time, bc there will be cases where it is the irresponsible choice, but i know i’ve been better these past couple of months bc of people like you that have shown me kindness, and as i write this reply, it’s a very sweet thought to know that something so loving could be reciprocal. <br><br>i hope, hope, hope beyond belief that you are well! did your sister end up returning home as planned? are you not in lahore anymore? have you been taking care of yourself? how are your loved ones? i hope no terrible headaches have plagued you since you were last here! tell me more about why evolutionary is the word that comes to mind now that you are another year older! if you’d like, that is. if you’d rather not, that’s also okay. you can tell me anything in your ccs, you know that. you were the first person to treat this little cc inbox as the sanctuary it will come to be in my mind, and from my perspective, you were central in shaping it to be what it is now. you are always welcome here, whenever or if ever you want to drop something. <br><br>i never not wish you all the best. all my good thoughts &amp; love to you always, zi 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>hello !! i hope you’ve been having good days as well, and i’m so thankful that you took the time to message me about flls and having a hard copy. it never stops blowing my mind that people would want one, and again, as long as you’re printing it solely for yourself, you have my full permission. that said, would you be able to dm me on twitter? you don’t need to come off private or follow me or anything like that. i just don’t feel all too comfortable posting my dropbox links on here. if it’s alright with you, i’d rather send you the pdf file over dms. but if this isn’t okay for you, please let me know in another cc message and i’ll figure something out that works for both of our comfort levels!</div>

 <div class=reply>definitely, definitely, definitely. i’m not sure what you were looking for in an answer, so i’m just going to do my usual overly detailed rambling in hopes that i hit the mark somehow. <br><br>but yeah... Yeah. i am now so far from where i started. i applied to three unis in hs and for two, my major was supposed to be in law or politics. the plan was to become a lawyer, or if not that, to work in forensics or be an embassy worker or whatever, but then the third uni offered a generous scholarship and bc my only financial support are loans and myself, it felt foolish not to take it. the caveat was that the scholarship only applied within the humanities faculty, so i was like, sure, i can work with an english degree. but i was unsatisfied with the curriculum, and frustrated with the people i met, and when i felt the exact opposite in my latin class, i started considering classics as a major. figured it made sense as an undergrad degree before law school, something to enjoy learning until then, but then an academic advisor noticed that i did well in language courses and offered linguistics to me. i was intrigued but didn’t want to let go of classics, so i double majored. linguistics opened up a diff path to me: neuroscience, psycholinguistics, and for a couple of years, while i was working as a research assistant for a classics prof, i also had a plan ready to maybe become a speech language pathologist. while all this was happening, i was also writing for the school newspaper and doing some nonfiction writing fellowships, and when i got promoted to an editor position in my last year, that opened up a journalism track as well. the same year, i participated in some theatre stuff, writing and directing a play, and for a bit, i was like, damn, is there a future in this? then after i took the lsat in my last year of uni, i kind of finalized my change of heart about law school and decided i was too disillusioned with the legal system to stake my future in it. <br><br>now i’m freshly graduated and unmoored. i’m working somewhere in both literary and audio production bc these were the jobs immediately available to me that felt like they aligned with what i wanted to do and support, but i’m also in the middle of the interview process for some museum jobs. i like what i’m doing, though i know i’ll feel understimulated eventually. some former profs have asked me if i want to pursue academia or do further education, but i’m kinda just. chilling. the last 6yrs have been nonstop work, and if i’ve learned anything, it’s that i’m very lucky i can live the kind of life where the universe just occasionally gives me a nudge towards something completely new. <br><br>all in all, i firmly believe i don’t know a lot, which i say not to be self-deprecating but bc i appreciate it as a fact. the world is so big! so much to discover and learn! with that said, you are so, so sweet and this was such a fun q. i’m sending you back all my love ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>Hello<br>I just read one of your work in ao3, namely here and where you are and decided to drop by your cc account.<br><br>First i want to thank you for sharing such a beautiful piece of work. I can't remember when was the last time i was so moved by something I read, I would never imagined it would be in the form of fanfiction tho (just to be clear i love fanfiction)<br><br>I cannot pinpoint or specifically explain how i feel reading your work but it is almost like an otherwordly experience. I wonder why, but then i realize because maybe i resonate with the theme so much. With Megumi. I imagine learning and realizing love after you have to end not one but two life.<br><br>I think you execute Megumi's feelings and development in the aftermath very well that for a moment i think that was canon. It was so heartbreaking but liberating at the same time, i don't think there would be a better way for Megumi to deal with his feelings.<br><br>Each word you put is so beautiful. Even though I don't understand love I think I can get a glimpse of it through your worldbuilding and narratives.<br><br>So thank you and sorry if this is weird. I think you are a wonderful writer</div>

 <div class=reply>this is the complete opposite of weird and you have nothing to apologize for. i… am so out of practice responding to ccs, it seems, and my brain’s not firing enough sparks to put together words that will convey to you how grateful i am for this message, but i really am. here and where you are is a fic that i have an intense tug of war relationship with, and while i’ve gotten many, many nice messages about it, all of them i’m thankful for, this is the first one to, i think, call it liberating. heartbreaking, yes, but also liberating. and that’s so interesting to me. i’ll be thinking about it for a while. that there was release, too, in the heartbreak. thank you, thank you, thank you for this cc.</div>

 <div class=question>hi, sha! i recently finished a lot of books because i also took some time off of social media. one of them was an essay collection about food (tikim by doreen gamboa fernandez) and the other a pretty mediocre rom-com (the spanish love deception by elena armas) that people on book tiktok and booktwt are raving about for some reason. i also read through the entirety of the poppy war trilogy in five days, so that's around two thousand worth of pages HAHAHA 😭 i'm not sure if these works are anywhere in your radar of interest, but i enjoyed reading (and hate-reading, in the case of the rom-com) them very much. <br><br>other than that, i started a new semester at uni and am currently in the process of applying for a job! at this point my entire life revolves around writing, which is both unexpected and comforting all the same. do you have any writing projects you have going on right now? :0 i'm also on chapter 4 of first love, late spring and i promise to leave a comprehensive comment on ao3 once i'm done hehe your words are absolute magic and they never fail to awaken something in me as i read. wishing kind days for you and that you'll be able to work through anything that troubles you at the moment 🫂🌟 take care always!!!</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m so sorry there are so many beautiful things going on in this cc and i swear i will get to them in a sec but you? read? the poppy war trilogy? in less than a week? oh my goodness. the rawness. the power. i told myself i would tackle it once i’ve earned myself a badge after reading the priory of the orange tree, but reading has unfortunately been slowgoing all around this summer. but i know i’ll get to reading tpw at some point! thank you for bringing it to mind for me. same with the spanish love deception, although for vastly different reasons sksjs i know you said hate-reading, but who knows, sometimes i might need exactly that to get through a dry reading period? <br><br>as for tikim, i immediately went to download a pdf as soon as i read your message! i’m finishing up taste of control by rené alexander orquiza for work, and while i’m still unsure where i stand on it As a book, it’s started an itch for more essay collections about food. someone from my work recommended sarap, another by doreen fernandez, so i’m super, super excited to have her double-signed by your own rec. <br><br>all that said, congratulations on starting a new sem at uni! i hope your social media break was good to you, and that you have the space to take care of yourself, whatever that might look like for you, as you head into what i imagine will be another busy period. i pray it will be as fulfilling as you need it to be. and all the best luck with the job app! god. i’m mid-process for like three jobs rn myself and i am sending you all the well wishes possible.<br><br>i haven’t been able to write much recently, just small pieces of dialogue and fragments of thoughts that i type into google keep or write down on a post it note then don’t really turn into anything. i really want to remedy that soon and try some short stories as a change, but thank you so much for asking. really can’t explain how nice it is to be asked, for reasons even i can’t parse rn. i don’t know how to return the same q to you without saddling you with an obligation to respond, though i very much would like to ask, so i guess i will settle for saying that if you have any writing projects going on yourself, or ones you’ll be starting as you return to your writing classes, i hope they go well and feel good and fulfilling. (i’ve used fulfilling twice in this answer now, haven’t i.) <br><br>last thing! i wish i had a way to convey to you how much i lit up when i saw you’re reading flls! it’s so wonderful to hear you say such kind things about it. things do get rocky after ch 4, and i’m always most curious about people’s thoughts about that second half, but rest assured that there is never any pressure to finish or even read flls. thank you so much for everything, gabi: the recs, taking the time to let me know how you’re doing, the well wishes, reading my little fic. just. everything. i wish you so much brightness and kindness. take care always as well 🤍🌱</div>

 <div class=reply>if you mean the cityboys one, i use noto! it comes in serif and sans serif on there, and i use both in varying weights. if you mean my personal, i believe that one’s exclusively overpass. <br><br>and oh my god, not silly at all, i feel bad hearing you’ve been looking for it for a while. please feel free to ask questions like this any time if it would be more convenient. i’ll try to answer quick as i can. and maybe you’ve been using it already, but there’s a chrome extension called fonts ninja that sometimes helps with looking for fonts. it’s not always accurate, i should note, but i thought i would mention it just in case.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello hello as usual i suddenly have forgotten every author i have ever read, but lately i’ve been reading a lot of ali smith and alexander weinstein and have been enjoying everything i consume from them. i feel like. if there’s a combination of both of my fav things about their writing, it would easily be my dream work of fiction. <br><br>and no, i don’t often listen to music when writing, but my most listened to artist for like a decade now, rain or shine, is sleeping at last. and this month so far, my most played albums are by novo amor and japanese breakfast. slowly but surely getting some adam melchor into my cooking playlist as well. <br><br>thank you so much for dropping by, and warm greetings right back to you from up north 💗</div>

 <div class=question>hello hello! i was wondering if you ever look back at something you've written and thought about going back to it and changing something about it? your writing is amazing and i really love the flow and care for detail you put into it. also, is there any genre(s) that you like writing the most or would like to try writing in the future? i'm wishing you well and hope the best comes to you soon! &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>always! all the time! it’s been months since flls and even now i sometimes remember things about it that i want to change. it’s not as strong an urge as it is with my much older work, non-fic included, where i always wonder why i ever thought these were palatable enough to publish anywhere. but. i try to think of it as just evidence of how ✨ far i’ve gone ✨ or something along those lines. there has to be merit in looking back at a story i wrote a handful of years ago and knowing that if i tackle the same thing now, it will be a completely different thing, not just bc i’m a different writer but bc i’m practically a whole other person, you know? the mind works differently, my relationship with words is different. but at the same time, i feel like if i tried to change anything about stuff i’ve finished and posted, they wouldn’t be the stories that they are right in this moment. so yes, i do want to change so much, all the time, but it’s also like. these stories that are out there are… out there. they’ve run their course with me and i’ve let them go complete and sure of how they wanted to be, and at the end of the day, that makes them kind of untouchable. <br><br>that said, thank you so much for complimenting my writing and even highlighting the parts of it you love! really makes me miss writing ❤️<br><br>and yes! easy answers to your other questions! i think i’ll always be a slice of life kind of writer at heart, just very small scale day to day and not very imaginative with plot and world-building bc i much prefer sitting with characters, but if ever i have the opportunity to dedicate time to learn and get better at it, i’d really love to write sci fi. a space opera would be wonderful. something fantasy with royalty is a dream project, too. or mechas. i just want to try something big and blockbuster-y bc i think it would make for a great playground for a lot of themes i want to keep writing about. though tbh it would probably just end up as a compromise between the genre i write now and the genre i actually want to write. so soft sci fi or light urban fantasy or even just very mild magical realism. i’ll settle for those. i want to try writing something that people will find magical, if even for a moment. <br><br>thank you for your well wishes and i am hoping all the same and more for you.</div>

 <div class=question>hi it's me the art school anon with a slight obsession with corduroys and hand callouses as a metaphor! whew that was a mouthful, and this is way too long overdue but life gets in the way sometimes and i slipped so i apologize, and big thanks if you still remember me.<br><br>i saw your recent tweet and thought i'd drop by to say something, but i'm just figuring this out as i go because i'm not entirely sure what it is that i wanna say. i've been inside for the better part of three months now and everything just feels kind of honeyed and slurred and blurry, so unfortunately not much good news either. (though i manage to raise three plants from seedlings/cuttings and they're thriving so there's the achievement of the quarter for me. i also killed like five others but we don't talk about that.) what i'm trying to say is, it's surely been a weird time for all of us, more so for you i'd presume. it's difficult for me to say it less cordially vague and actually sympathetic-sounding, or to dish out relevant advice, but know that spiritually i'm with you. as i grow older i've found that there's a lot to be learned and appreciated from quiet - sometimes i find that a steady presence can be just as reassuring. so if you feel like it's helpful to have someone in the same space doing their own thing but just - *vague hand gesture* - there, do know the sentiment is there. (or you could always imagine me in corduroy and mismatched socks.)<br><br>i'm reaching out specifically because honestly i do feel like i owe you and your writing a big one for this arc of my life. it's been a wild ride trying to just slow down and carve myself a space where i don't have to be someone all the time, and through you i've learned a lot of patience and sympathy that i don't necessarily have for myself. i've been shouldering a lot in the hopes that it would toughen me up, but things go brittle without tempering. i guess what i'm trying to say is i've always had a hard time comprehending tenderness and it's kinda serendipitous that i ended up knowing it by reading fanfiction, haha - but i guess that's kinda life in general for you. it gets really, really ugly some days; but it's bone-achingly, heart-wrenchingly beautiful, and it's nice to know that there are always hands out there willing to carve out that nook of haven for you (even when they don't know it).<br><br>incoherent and sentimental rambling aside, please do know that i'm eternally grateful for you and your tender wisdom, and that as exaggerated as this may sound i do assure you i cannot ever say that enough. i hope this gave you a space to crawl into and rest, and please don't feel pressured to reply. just shout into the twitter void if you ever need a ~*presence*~ and i'll shoot you a paragraph. or an entire essay. take care, and stay bright x</div>

 <div class=reply>i love this intro to bits but oh my god of course i remember you !! megumi’s corduroy jacket and the art school universe that came out of that is forever fresh in my mind, and i’ve wondered on many occasions how you’re doing. and if i didn’t, there’s no way i’ll forget after this. <br><br>this message feels like someone bringing you morning tea in bed without you asking as much as it does receiving a firm, reassuring clap on the back. the sort that comes from someone who doesn’t really talk much, and yet that one clap conveys everything that sits between simple acknowledgement and steady assurance. not that one has to read between the lines to see the tenderness in this cc! you word things in such a way that it feels like reading a handwritten letter, and you’re absolutely right, there’s a lot to be appreciated from quiet and steady. you have given me that and so much more. thank you, thank you, thank you. <br><br>i’m very sorry to hear there’s not much good news on your end, either. i’ve been inside for nearly every day of the past year and a bit myself, and i’ve run fresh out of optimism on that front, honestly, but at the same time, there’s still a lot i find moving about hearing how other people’s lives are going, even if it’s something as simple as you telling me you have raised three plants from seedlings/cuttings alone. bc damn? i really do believe that is an achievement? congratulations? and i am sending love to both you and your little plantlings !! may they grow well under your careful hands. <br><br>thank you specifically as well for saying that things go brittle without tempering. i was so struck by the way you worded this that i had to do a stretch break. i think sometimes i get caught up with the idea of being someone who can take on all these things without so much as wavering bc i’ve done it before or whatever, then i get frustrated when i show even the smallest sign that i’m not, and that adds on to the weight, etc, etc. so in danger of sounding like a self-care ad, it’s really wondrous to hear you remind me in turn to also slow down and find it in me to redefine how to be tender to myself without having to be someone at the same time. i’m still figuring it out, and that’s a whole other kind of process, but what i really want to say in all this is that i’m grateful you took the time to reach out. i wish you all the best, truly, truly, in all that you do. and by best i mean gentle. and by gentle i mean that i hope life gives you the space to live it. <br><br>is that too cheesy? maybe. but i mean it. please don’t feel pressured to reply to this, either! thank you for sitting with me here. (and i’m sorry if i got too sentimental or personal. it’s not my intention to dump anything on you. or anyone, for that matter.)<br><br>you stay bright as well, in all your wonderful corduroy and mismatched socks 💛</div>

 <div class=question>hii sha! i’m sorry to hear that things have been hard for you lately, but i am mentally sending u rays of sunshine and happiness and warmth to make it all better soon! i hope you find small and nice things to do daily that can make things less painful and more enjoyable in the slightest and that the Big Things improve soon enough! fall is on its way and i’m sure it will bring u exciting and comfortable things with it! in the meantime, please take care of yourself, of your mind and body and please stay safe!! &lt;3<br><br>with that said! i do have a rec for you! but first… well there isn’t a day that goes by where i don’t think at least once about flls &amp; that has been going on ever since i read it for the first time. i’m saving my third reread for the end of the year but it’s so frustrating bc there just isn’t anything as good as that masterpiece out there😓i could spend two days talking abt your itafushi but this time there’s smth else abt it that i would like to share: and that is abt you. i think it is almost a universal experience to meet someone on public transportation and finding them so cool you wish you could be their friend somehow. this feeling of just paying unnoticed attention to a stranger, seeing them focused on a book, a song, a sign, the landscape or nothing at all and wondering abt their life and all the decisions they made that brought them there. their taste in music, their favorite food, what their grandma usually gifts them, their favorite moment of the day etc etc…i hope this does not sound stalker-ish or anything dhsjjdej but reading flls made me feel like i had gotten a glimpse of the person you are and it made me wish i had met u sometime in my past. because u are such an interesting and kind person and that is evidenced on the way u care for ur characters and how you so carefully build the plot. ok idk where im going from here but i rlly just wanted to tell u that &amp; i think that it is enough reason to call your writing magical. thank u for sharing it with us i am forever grateful &lt;3<br><br>recs rn!: lorde’s new album (i can’t put my finger on it but there’s just smth so You in it) and moon river by frank ocean :) <br>please take care!!!!!!! i admire you very very much! sending u lots of love</div>

 <div class=reply>i think i got this cc right as my battery reached 1% and i remember just trying to keep it together in the back of a taxi and wishing that i can finish reading this in its entirety before my phone shut down. and i did, luckily, bc this message really burrowed itself deep beyond all the other thoughts that were going on at the time. it’s been a few days since, and i’m much calmer now and all around embarrassed for even tweeting what i did, but none of that takes away from how grateful i am for this cc. i just. really wasn’t expecting this at all. this whole night, i’ve been trying to string together a response but i think right now really the best approach is to be honest and straight up admit to you that, in the best way possible, this has left me at a complete loss for words. <br><br>like? i’m so? your kind, beautiful words about flls alone are staggeringly generous, and i don’t think i’ll ever properly get over all the response to that fic, but the rest of your message? i’m wringing my hands. in the barest definition, neither of us know each other, but the fact that you took the time to write all this out, when i am a total stranger that you could have just passed over and waved off or even just spared one brief and fleeting thought for and be done with it — it’s unbelievable?? there’s so much warmth here and so much of me feeling seen in you thinking of me as a person at all in connection to my fics? and even something as small as saying there’s some shared vibes with lorde’s new album, in all its quiet and sunshine? i’m losing my mind. it’s like receiving a long, heartfelt card from someone i didn’t even know liked me. and. god. i also don’t know where i’m going with this. i’m just speechless. i also feel like the responsible thing to do here is for me to discourage any of your ideas re: me being a better person than i probably actually am, but right now, it just feels really nice to be surprised with a message like this 😅 you might very well be kinder than i deserve, but no matter what, i’m really, really, Really thankful for this. that’s all. <br><br>that’s all, that’s all, that’s all, and yet it is also everything. insert finger guns here. i badly wish i could treat you to a coffee for this. or tea or whatever your fav beverage is. please take care of yourself as well. sending you all the love in the tune of moon river.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh. stunning question in so many ways. half bc it’s one i’ve thought about a lot and am yet to find an answer to, and half bc the way you worded it really highlights, i think, the difficulty of doing this. <br><br>i’ll be talking out of my 🍑 more than usual for this one, but to me, personally and specifically, it’s really just. having faith in the possibility of love. <br><br>idk what it’s like to be in love, and i don’t have a consistent history of being loved. i don’t always love people and the world, either. it’s smth i have to consciously remind myself of — that for all that i feel so much empathy and sadness for the ways of the world, it’s prob not the case that the world necessarily feels it in turn. you said it well. the world feels difficult to love. sometimes, to me, it’s like, why should i work to believe in love and kindness and optimism when the world isn’t very keen on proving their existence to me? <br><br>and. idk the answer to that one. a small part of it is that there’s really no choice but to keep going. i’m holding on by the skin of my teeth here, and i’d rather hold onto smth that will also hold onto me too if it could. but the bigger part is that it isn’t about me, you know? and esp not the way i hurt or whatever. i wrote this the other day, “all the things i feel? they’re mine. they don’t have to be other people’s, too. the onus to validate my experiences isn’t on anyone else but myself and those involved. and while i can be as cold and bitter and judgmental as the next guy + i also get how toxic too much superficial positivity can be — at least in my writing and to the few harmless people around me, i don’t really want to inflict my own hurt on others because of a vendetta against the world.” and yes, that’s a digression that has nothing to do with your much simpler q, but i think that writing my hurt into things is just writing for my ego. and while there’s nothing inherently wrong with that — i’ve def done and understand it — i am done with it at this age in my life. i want to write with compassion, and in my head, that means writing characters into love and love-adjacent experiences that i have to work hard to understand on their behalf. <br> <br>but anyway. when i write people in love, i think i’m really just believing in what i want to be the inherent capacity of human beings to understand each other. i think love and understanding are two fundamentally similar things. so. i don’t have to know what it’s like to be in love to write characters in love. i just have to see painfully human characters enough to hopefully understand them and their interiority and the ways they might fall in love with each other, and what that looks like. it’s the only way i can still find it in me to love the world in turn.<br><br>an incomplete, evasive answer as always, i know... it’s the best i can offer at this moment, i’m afraid. thank you so much for this q.</div>

 <div class=question>heyy I wanted to recommend an album called Ex:re by Ex:re (it’s the singer from the band Daughter; I think u know em). I saw that you were having some difficult times so I thought I’d share the album I often listen to when my thoughts aren’t the best. The songs make me sad but are simultaneously comforting so maybe it’ll help. I’m currently listening to it rn. Typing this out I’m in a hotel, getting ready to head out and move into my university dorms. I’m quite terrified lmao, mostly bc this feels unreal ( idk if covid had a big part of it. Probably bc I was in junior yr wdym I’m in college now 😭). But yeah. This is nothing comforting but maybe a small little insight on my life can be helpful. I am gonna go see a movie (Shang-Chi) with my roommate so that’s nice and exciting. Anyways I hope you feel better and that everything settles <br>have a nice day &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>no bc wait wait wait Wait daughter has been one of my go-to for bruised tender emotion and i didn’t know elena had a solo project. thank you so much, this is wonderful news and definitely something to look forward to once i can listen to the album. <br><br>also !! no obligation at all to be comforting !! it’s nice to be hearing about your day and where you’re at. which. god. wow. time really flew by for you, jeez. it’s no small shock to be transitioning to your college years after being in covid limbo for the latter half of your time in high school, i imagine, and it’s normal to be more than quite terrified. but it’s pleasant to hear that you’re gonna be hanging out with your roommate, and i wish you both a smooth first month in college. <br><br>again, thank you for this cc. take care of yourself, stay safe, good luck with school, give yourself the space to feel every complicated emotion that might arise. the biggest congratulations on starting uni ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>what !!! oh my god. i’ll sound like i’m reacting to someone’s engagement or baby shower or something but damn. that’s such an amazing thing to share with me, no matter what your motivations for it might be. you have so much self-awareness and i know you said you already had a mishap but i can feel the self-discipline coming through the screen sjshjs this is so impressive?? i’m excited for you?? i know it’s gonna be a Journey™ but you’ll do great. growing pains are to be expected in any transition and it sounds to me that you’re already working hard and steady and just. yes. wishing you all the good things and i am cheering you on big time.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh. wow. i know i asked for any kind of message you feel comfortable to spare and that you probably didn’t send this wanting a reply like the one i’m about to give but. bc it’s just me to you, anonymous stranger, i still want to say that i am so struck? by this? i don’t know your situation and i can only imagine how terrifying and difficult it is to be in your position, but speaking as someone who is having to pick myself back up right now from a real rough breaking point and barely being able to scrounge up enough willpower to do it — i hope you know, or that you’ve been told, how much resilience you must have to start anew. bravery and strength are cliche commonplace buzzwords when it comes to stuff like this, so i won’t use them, but a close sentiment is very much there. you said it yourself that you’ve never been more scared than this, and the fact that you experienced something that sounds so awful and is still going back to the process from square one? jeez. i hope you know how raw and astonishing that is. thank you for sharing this small personal little tidbit with me. i wish you all the best.</div>

 <div class=reply>A STRONG, LOVELY, EVOCATIVE LIST. there is so much light in this cc, in everything from good food as a love language to love voiced out loud to the brightness i can hear in you describing your musical pursuits, and i am very, very thankful you took the time to write all these out for me. <br><br>and oof my Big Bad Horrible Things are unfortunately not quite easy to approach and articulate in one cc, and for better or for worse, it’s the sort of stuff that won’t really go away or improve, but i truly, truly, Truly appreciate you offering to help me unburden. there is so much kindness in the thought process that went into this message. i hope the peace in your life sticks around for as long as you need it, and i am sending you a hug back ☀️🌷</div>

 <div class=question>hey! i hope your inbox is filled with ccs and mine is just one upon them. have you ever watched ace of diamond or daiya? it has a lot of content and a very small fandom with only around 9k fics in the tags. i recently saw you're anxious to be writing for big fandoms when you answered a cc for a hq fic question. i hope you at least check daiya. it's fun, intense and filled with lovable characters. might be a good fit for you!!</div>

 <div class=reply>i have! i’m actually relatively caught up with the manga, by my usual standards, though i’m still working through the act ii anime. it’s definitely always on my mind, and i’m also surprised i haven’t written for a sports anything since hq in like 2014. but yeah. i’m waiting for something in diaace to call out to me and push me to write, if ever? i wrote for it a bit also in 2014 but. that was so so early in the series. it would be pretty interesting to write for it now, for sure!<br><br>in any case, though, i completely agree with how you describe daiya and i have many, many years’ worth of fondness for it. i never know what i’ll end up writing for, but if ever the stars align for me and this series, it would be a welcome opportunity. <br><br>on a more serious note, thank you so much for taking the time to send this cc. it brought a degree of normalcy in the least normal of situations and i’m just really glad you left this when you did. thank you and all my well wishes to you 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>this is such a sweet little unexpected rec. i need you to know that getting this was the first thing to make me smile with real lightness that one night and i have you to thank for that. it’s just such a wonderfully mundane thing but it meant a lot to hear myself think that i will definitely try this. sometimes envisioning a future for yourself starts with acknowledging that there will be another morning to try coffee in, you know? but anyway this sounds schmaltzy what i mean is thank you and i do love both coffee and chocolate and i can’t wait to try this asap ☕️</div>

 <div class=question>hihi!! im so sorry if this has been answered already, (you can definitely link me to a previously answered cc if it has!!) but i was wondering what the significance was to switching the narrative style from third person to second person in flls. ive always wondered this and my friends and i have theorized haha but yes just a lil question!</div>

 <div class=reply>i know i’ve answered it somewhere but idk if it was a cc or a dm or a comment, or what i even said exactly so i’m sorry please bear with me while i meander through a fresh response!<br><br>it’s a mix of technical and narrative reasons? i wrote the first 4 chs of flls in a tight schedule, and before getting back into it for ch5, i sort of stepped away altogether just so i can return to it hopefully with fresh eyes. idk how successful that was, but i do know that when i returned to flls after writing another fic, i had a weird time adjusting back to writing from yuuji’s head. i think i said in another cc that yuuji’s chs are easier to write than megumi’s in some way bc he does so much and goes to so many places that his scenes don’t have the physical restrictions that megumi’s chapters sometimes have, but on the flip side, yuuji is also a bit trickier to write bc he thinks and feels things so, so differently from how i do. and that difference between us had to be navigated somehow when so much of flls ended up dependent on how deeply yuuji’s emotions run and all the ways his thoughts spiral and knot together. <br><br>add to that the fact that ch5 was such a critical chapter? i knew the fight had to happen at the end of it, and i had a vague idea what it might look like, but i still had to build enough tension to get there and make it combust. i tried writing so many versions of ch5 — i think the deleted scenes doc for that ch alone has more than 10k words — but nothing was sticking and i was just. exhausted. and i loathed every single thing i tried. then i sort of had a lightbulb moment and remembered that i started flls with the expectation that not many people will want to read it and i’ll be able to experiment with small things i haven’t had experience trying (intimidatingly long paragraphs, multiple povs for the same story, inserting newsletters and voicemails and the like, etc.) and since i knew i needed to change something drastic about the doc after burning out from all my other attempts, i said to hell with it and switched to 2P. <br><br>and like. i don’t really love 2P in longform writing. i really just don’t often like 2P, period. but this also made it the breakthrough i needed for ch5 bc i needed smth exhausting. it felt like changing the aspect ratio and just zooming in a little too uncomfortably close to yuuji and staying there for too long. on one hand, 2P helped maybe put the reader in yuuji’s shoes, but on the other, i kept it bc it was sometimes so heavy and wrong and uncomfy to write and read back. and that set the tone for the rest of the ch. for me at least, writing it. <br><br>anyway. this is an oversimplified ramble. someday i’ll properly examine why i decided on the change. tysm for this q and god the thought of someone theorizing on flls with other people makes me so so ? touched ? wow ?</div>

 <div class=reply>tysm for watching it and reading the masterpost, this is such a thoughtfully crafted question. but yeah! my first taika was actually Boy? iirc i saw it at this youth film festival that my then best friend and i went to every year, and the brochure description of it said something along the lines of how deftly taika juxtaposes love vs. bitterness, fantasy vs. reality, comedy vs. the really difficult, emotional moments. and god, i was so much younger back then, and i haven’t rewatched Boy in a long time, but if i am to trace my philosophy about writing nowadays — in that i gravitate towards stories that find balance in the space between happy and sad or easy and difficult, or stories about how even the best families fail their children, or how stories about how much importance love and imagination and belonging can have for one person — i do think Boy will be somewhere in that origin story. there’s a lot in it that i remember thinking taika handled so deftly, though to be fair he had me the moment he made it a story about a boy and his father, but there’s just so much understanding and empathy that i found in that movie when i watched it as a young teenager, and maybe that’s what i really mean when i say early taika was so formative. he was on an emotional wavelength that i also wanted to be at as a creator, i think, although i wouldn’t realize this until much later. <br><br>anyway. that’s a tangent. i watched Eagle vs. Shark shortly after Boy, but i don’t really have strong feelings towards it? i do get what it was trying to do, but i feel it’s still holding back? What We Do in the Shadows, though, is prob the taika movie i’ve rewatched the most; i always find myself suggesting it in group settings where i have to break the tie bw diff movie tastes. it just never gets old. there’s so many things it does well and there’s so much humanity in this silly little movie about vampires as well as things to learn about how to navigate working with decades-old tropes? it’s a great time. i’ve seen Thor: Ragnarok and thought it was a necessary breath of fresh air for the thor movies, but while i think taika balanced his own style well with the mcu being the mcu, it’s still very much an mcu movie. i have not seen Jojo Rabbit and can’t really speak to whether its premise works, but i Did see the last scene once and got a little choked up even without context. <br><br>and Hunt for the Wilderpeople is one of those things i was in the perfect emotional place for when i found it, and it remains to this day one of my fav films ever. there’s a category of movies i file away in my head as Has So Much Heart It Makes Mine Feel Hollow, and HFTW is very reflective of that. Boy and the short film Two Cars, One Night are in a way more up my alley when it comes to writing, but all in all, HFTW is still to this day taika at his best from my perspective.</div>

 <div class=reply>hello!! this is so, so kind, and it feels incredibly validating to know my little interests here and there are of interest in turn to you. i don’t know about lately, bc life has been a bit too… emotionally crowded? these past couple of months? but. if we’re looking at the whole summer so far, here are some stuff that have made me feel things, one each for what you listed:<br><br>📚 she who became the sun wasn’t a book i was planning to read soon, but it came to my local bookstore around a week ahead of the release date and i decided to read the first chapter. i was enamoured from the beginning, the rest is history, etc. it’s basically a retelling? reimagining? of the life of zhu yuanzhang, the founding emperor of the ming dynasty. people like to say that it’s mulan meets song of achilles, which i don’t necessarily think is fair, but if it gets more readers in, then ofc i respect it. this is one of the first books in a long, long time to really grip me, and without getting too-too much into it, there’s just so many things i find so wonderful in how it handles its characters and its themes. i was literally having physiological reactions to it while reading, which very few things have gotten out of me. so. if historical lit is your thing at all, this is my Please Read It If You Haven’t. <br><br>🎥 not strictly an anime, but i haven’t seen many people around me talk about it so. link click is a donghua about — i guess — a business run by these two guys who can, in a way, time travel through photos. i’m not the best at describing sff premises, clearly, but if you’re looking for a quick, gripping watch that, to quote a text i sent my friend, “was still rife with so much compassion and love and humanity,” link click might be your guy? it’s a very balanced mix of genres and heart, i feel. <br><br>🍳i’ve been living off jeremy scheck’s recipes this whole year, but the one i’ve made the most is probably this spicy rigatoni with vodka: https://scheckeats.com/spicy-rigatoni-with-vodka/<br><br>🎵 not really an album, but these days, if i’m too lazy to sort through my own playlists and albums, i’ll pop this on and wait for the spotify algorithm to do the rest: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4LPjSW78Dkf2TKhCs0nQrw?si=45c984e9cdc34e27<br><br>📖 some teenage-specific tastes you don’t really outgrow and catherynne m. valente is one of them for me. add to that a retelling of orpheus &amp; eurydice and this story from last week was [insert fireworks here]: https://www.tor.com/2021/08/25/lespirit-de-lescalier-catherynne-m-valente/<br><br>hope all the links work okay !! thank you so much for this and for your kind words. wishing you a gentle morning / evening / night !!</div>

 <div class=reply>ohhh wow what a terrifying question. but not in a way that’s on you! i just think that it’s a question easier to answer in the context of flls, in that i think both yuuji and megumi had to learn to see each other as two human beings who are constantly in flux. and that loving each other wouldn’t be enough to stabilize all the change and baggage that’s inevitable in their lives. which is really just what i mean when i say being at the beginning. it’s the understanding that when you commit to loving someone whole-heartedly and for the long run, you are committing to a neverending process instead of a single moment or a single version of them or a single idea of what your relationship will look like. and that process will sometimes take you back to the very beginning, where you have to relearn each other all over again or remake your love from scratch. to make something new again. to see each other again and again in a different light, from different angles. <br><br>which i happen to believe is a privilege. at its healthiest sense, it’s a wonder to me, you know? the idea of having someone whom you essentially rediscover every few years, and to still See them and choose them and fall in love with them over and over again. that’s why i think i used the word “lucky” in flls. on a level that goes beyond the fic, i think that to reach a high degree of understanding that life is just a series of having to find yourself back at the beginning of something — of growing up, of career stuff, of a different role in society from child to parent to grandparent or whatever — and to be able to apply that to your relationship with another person? that’s peak balance. peak contentment. and contentment, to me, more than happiness, is something truly rare and lucky.</div>

 <div class=question>hi again! i’m sorry for taking so long to reply, but your question has really made me think a lot, and i didn’t want to rush my answer. <br>before answering—i sincerely want to thank you for taking your time to reply to me. your words really moved me. actually, your entire reply made my whole day, you have no idea how much i needed to hear what you told me. i was feeling really anxious and reading your kind -and wise words- made feel a lot better, so, thank you thank you thank you.<br><br>about your question; writing has always been one of the best—if not the only—way i have of expressing myself. i’m a shy, anxious person, and talking to people has always been extremely hard for me to do. so when all my emotions get bottled up, when i start feeling so many things that i don’t know what to do with them, writing is my only escape. it always has been, and it still is. there’s nothing i love more than expressing what i feel through a story or a character. however, i can’t deny that it Is true that i base almost everything i do on others’ approval, not only when it comes to writing. i’m physically unable to determine whether what i do is good or not. and when even something i loved as much as writing got appreciated… i felt like i was genuinely good at something for the first time. but tbh my current teacher absolutely hates my writing because she finds it overly metaphorical and stuff—and i stopped writing for a couple of months because of her, but i somehow found the strength to start again; mostly because i wanted to prove her wrong. so, in some ways, it is about others’ praises, but in other ways, -in most of them i’d say,- it isn’t. i’m learning to care less about what others think. a parte of me knows i always will, but what you said, “people who praise your work will come and go/you and your writing are worth more than one person’s opinion of it” really made me think. a lot. and it also put my heart at ease.<br><br>however. i’m genuinely impressed by how you perfectly understood my feelings through a single message. “it sounds like you miss writing without the need to compare it to others” yes. absolutely. i didn’t know how to express what i was feeling and this sentence described it perfectly ;’) <br>thank you for all your advice, i feel so much calmer now that i read your response. i wish i was able to put into words how much of a wonderful person you seem but i don’t think a single adjective would be able to express it, so what i can tell you is that i wish you the absolute best and that i hope you will never ever ever stop writing. thank you for your time &lt;3<br><br>(i read in one of your responses that you’ve never been to tokyo!! howwww how did you describe every single place in flls so perfectly omg your talent really is unique. you truly have a gift. i admire you more than words will ever be able to explain)</div>

 <div class=reply>no, please, both of my replies have taken even longer !! i always support not wanting to rush an answer; there’s merit in letting yourself sit with your thoughts before rushing to say or answer anything. <br><br>that said, it’s a massive relief to hear from you again about this! i’ve been worrying a lot about maybe being too harsh or cold, or not responding with enough thoughtfulness — so it puts my heart at ease as well to know that my reply did even a small thing for you. <br><br>it’s funny, too, bc so much in this cc resonates with me. everyone’s relationship with writing is different, but it’s enough for me to recognize some familiar beats in the way you describe yours. and i think, as idyllic and sentimental as it is for me to say, that it’s enough that your writing means something to you. i know that loving it doesn’t get rid of the days where you don’t like your writing or feel like it’s shit, but. if writing is how you feel most connected to the world, if it’s your outlet and your best form of escape, then i think it’s a big, big shame to ever give up on it. especially when you’re only Just getting started at it. you’re going to get so much better even if the process feels slow and dull. i read this manga called ikoku nikki, and a novelist character tells her friend that her book isn’t really selling well. then she adds that she feels bad for the characters in the book. in the translation i read, she says, “I mean, it took so much for these characters to Be There, and I might not be able to write about them anymore.” and so. you still have so many stories and characters in you, is what i think. stories and characters that take so much to be there, to come to life in your head. i believe it would be terrible if the opinion of one person stopped those stories and characters from existing at your hands. that’s all. <br><br>as for the rest of your msg: first, don’t beat yourself up too much for needing other people’s approval. it’s natural to use that as a compass, esp at your age. the only point of care is to make sure you’re still a person beyond the things defined for you by other people. second, there will be people who won’t like your writing, and as much as it stings, there will be times that you can learn smth from them. not always, bc people will hate things out of their own preferences, but. make the call whether there’s anything of value from criticism. and then move on to the next path of growth. give your writing space to change and evolve, and in doing so, give yourself the same space?<br><br>i feel like i’ve been talking in circles in this reply but. i am out of room now, so let me say goodbye, thank you so, so much and as always, like many other people in life who will offer you advice, i’m not a sole, rigid authority on anything. these are my thoughts, yes, but all these aside, i just want the best for you, however you yourself define it. so. please take care of yourself 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hii, i hope you’re doing well! so, where should i start. first of all i apologize if there are any grammar mistakes or smth but english isn’t my first language:)<br>i’m coming from ao3 and i’ve just finished reading flls for the second time. it was just as heart-wrecking as the first time, i will never be able to express how much i love that fic. i wanted to thank you for sharing your gorgeous writing with us. i swear to god, every single paragraph had me on the verge of tears. it’s not an exaggeration. i wish it was. your fic completely devastated me—it’s the good kind of pain tho.<br><br>i’m sending this to you for two main reasons; firstly i just really needed to tell you how much your brilliant writing has made me.. feel? feel isn’t enough to describe the rollercoaster of emotions i went through while reading your masterpiece, but still. everything about flls was so deep and heartbreaking but soft and soothing at the same time—with the way you described places, feelings, every single detail, i could always imagine what was going on and the vibes were immaculate✨✨ i’m in love with the way you portrayed both megumi and yuuji and their different ways to show their love, it almost made me feel nauseous -the good kind of nausea again i swear😭- because of how good, realistic and angsty it was. everytime i listen to first love late spring all i see is them, them at disneyland, them at tsumikis wedding, them meeting again in chapter 7. you shaped my favorite song in so many ways. the whole book felt like one long mitski song, too. i would write a whole essay about what i loved about the fic but yk the characters are limited. so. moving on to the next point.<br><br>i wanted to ask you for.. uhhh, help? i guess? can it be defined as help? <br>so. i’m 16 now. i’ve loved writing for years. in middle school, eighth grade exactly, my italian teacher hyped my essays up a lot. like, too much. it got my hopes up. i thought i would become a writer. but lately i’ve been comparing myself to other, more skilled authors, and i’ve started hating everything i write. i’ve never felt so unmotivated and useless and it’s really hurting me. i wanted to ask you if you’ve ever felt like this, somewhere or somehow during your writing path. if you ever felt hopeless or lost faith in yourself. if you ever did, how did you overcome it?<br><br>i’m gonna leave now lol, but i sincerely want to thank you again. thank you thank you thank you for giving me the opportunity to read something as beautiful as your fic, i’m still crying over it after like one month. you’re one of my biggest inspirations &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>let me first get all the gratitude out of the way, of which there is a lot, lot, lot. you are so kind and thoughtful and you make complimenting my work such a beautiful thing. thank, you, thank you, thank you for your generosity and love as a reader. <br><br>now. i answered a cc some time back about feeling insecure in my writing, and i still stand by what i said there: https://curiouscat.qa/sleeptowns/post/1208274548<br><br>talking to you specifically, i have a difficult question to ask. it’s a bit cold, despite my attempts to soften it; i promise i mean no cruelty with it. but — do you love writing in itself, the way you have loved it for years, or do you love writing nowadays bc you’re good at it? bc it’s something that someone has praised you for? and if you do, there’s nothing wrong with that, but i feel like i have to point to tying your self worth or the worth of your art / craft based on external praise. bc the people who will praise you for your work will come and go over the years, and i promise that you and your writing are worth much more than one person’s opinion of it.<br><br>if you ask me, though, ofc i do think you love it, period. bc you also asked me how to overcome that insecurity, and that sounds like you miss being able to write without the need to compare it to others. and ahhh i don’t think i’ve figured that part out. but what i have figured out is knowing the story i want to write, specifically, and sure, maybe there are people who will write it better than i can, but it’s not. really. about that. or at least i’ve worked to make sure it isn’t. i just love putting the words on the page, i just love the characters i put into the story, and i refuse to hate them just bc i think someone else will handle them better. i don’t think it’s fair to hate my child for another adult’s potential ability to parent them, etc. <br><br>but i also know all this is sentimental nonsense, and please always feel free to send me anything in response or as a follow up. the truth is idk the answer to this any more than you, i’m afraid. what i can tell you, though, is: rough patches with writing aren’t permanent. please don’t give up just yet. you’re so young, and you’re only just getting started. you have so much room to grow. and if you feel suffocated by writing right now, it’s okay — and sometimes necessary — to take a break and seek out growth in other forms of storytelling, whether in plays or graphic novels or whatever. read outside of what you write, read writing that will inspire you without making you feel crappy and overaware of what you feel you can’t do. or maybe challenge yourself out of your comfort zone. or just rest. that, too, is part of writing. <br><br>i’m cheering you on. you’re okay. if not right now, you will be someday. do what you can. love what you can, discard what you can’t. breathe. know that you can always come back to what you leave behind. writing is sweet like that.</div>

 <div class=reply>unfortunately, i haven’t posted on any platforms ahhh but i know what you mean! i was lucky to be able to self publish some of my non fic writing, but i also have looked into places where i could post some without necessarily Publishing-publishing it, to not much luck. it’s definitely intimidating at best and iffy at worst. that said, from the tone of this cc — have you looked into medium? i think ideally the People Who Know These Things say that a site like wordpress might be your best bet, but i also think it’s a bit outdated advice in some sense and just too clunky in others. medium is a little more active &amp; streamlined, and i worked once for a publication that was hosted on it. it’s probably more friendly towards nonfiction, but i’m sure there exists corners for fiction. <br><br>though to be clear, this isn’t me insistently nudging you towards it !! and i understand that if you’ve looked around, you probably Have checked out medium. but if i had to absolutely pick from the pile, it will probably be this one. other clean alternatives will be to host on your own website, although that might make discoverability harder, or just finishing something to self publish. but yeah. i know. it’s hard and messy and i second you on how intimidating it is. <br><br>i apologize for not having a more helpful answer 😐 i also wish there was a site like tapas and such for casual original writing, but if there are, i’m not familiar. <br><br>thank you so much for your kind words and i hope you have a wonderful day as well!</div>

 <div class=question>heyo cityboys! i've been eager to write to you again since i got a response to you last time (i'm the one who asked how long it takes to write a 100k piece ehe). i've been wondering - are you into haikyuu? i'm sure i've read somewhere, probably on your carrd that you're a fan of haikyuu and that you would've written for the fandom if only the writing bubble for it wasn't so big. if you don't mind, may i know what's your favourite ship(s)? or platonic pairings, even. i'd love to know headcanons - anything, really. i don't know, i've always felt that kurooken and kagehina would fit the general thread of topics you write on, maybe because there's one character who's seemingly detached and another who's endlessly energetic. either that, or because i have a bias and i wonder if you like them too! <br><br>on that note, i recently finished reading "first love, late spring" which i somehow read AFTER the sequel without actually realising they're connected until i got to the last chapter (whoops). it's such a gorgeous fic and i know friends who think the same, even people on the internet who have recommended it to me. can't say enough of this but the way you write emotion is so, so amazing, especially since i empathise with the feelings that megumi have. i'm not very sure what's the kind of music you enjoy most but "adventure of a lifetime" by coldplay and "why'd you only call me when your high" by arctic monkeys really remind me of your fics and i think they'd serve as great inspiration if it's the type of music you enjoy~<br><br>i hope you're doing well and maybe remember me as "mira" for other occasions i write to you again :D</div>

 <div class=reply>hi mira, thank you for writing again! i’m super endeared to hear you were excited to do so!<br><br>i Am a fan of hq! i’m easily anxious about posting work, so i try — key word, bc i do have my vanities — to strike a balance between being as unmemorable as possible while still fulfilling the bare minimum of my need for validation in writing. i can usually only talk myself into writing for tags where the anime hasn’t aired yet or has only just started airing, as a little compromise between the need for validation while still convincing myself i won’t be particularly of note. if that makes sense. that said, i did actually write for hq once upon a time, back in 2014 when the anime just started and the tag was a fledgling little thing on ao3. now it’s Massive, and i think i’ll always be too scared to ever write for it again. plus the tag is so big now that i’m sure i have nothing to contribute that hasn’t already been done, and better. <br><br>with that context in mind, when i wrote for hq, it was for kghn and iwaoi !! it was so early on in the series, though, like two eps into the anime and the manga was only at the shiratorizawa match, so i don’t know if i’ll have the same approach to writing for hq now as i did back then? but i think iwaoi will always be compelling to me, whether platonic or romantic; furudate was so generous about how much there is to think about with the timeskip storylines they got. and kghn will always have my favourite dynamic &amp; arc of any central ✨ sports anime main duo ✨<br><br>ahhh this is so hard for me to think about. which i swear is not on you, i just don’t have strong attachments to any ships at the moment so nothing’s surfacing easily. i’ll be honest: if i ever do write for hq, it will probably be a genfic. i have an endless list of platonic pairings and groups i love, and hq does all these dynamics so well that it will be a treat to write about any of them. i’d love to write something from natsu’s perspective. so much to be said about the differences in her and shouyou’s volleyball journey. and same with the kageyamas and tsukishimas. i feel very deeply about all of them. <br><br>at some point, i’d have loved to write anything with atsumu, period, just bc i have so many thoughts and emotions about him and everyday of my life i’m flabbergasted that furudate managed to give me one of my top hq favs well past the halfway point of the story. but atsumu is also the kind of character whose simplicity makes him complicated, and i find that very difficult bc i get so nitpicky about it.<br><br>i’m out of space and didn’t even realize there was more to your cc good god thank you so much for your sweet, sweet words about flls. and i haven’t heard the coldplay song you rec’d! will listen asap! <br><br>also, i know i didn’t really directly address your q and i’m really sorry; i’ll think more about it, promise. and you’re always welcome to my inbox so drop by whenever! ☀️🌷</div>

 <div class=reply>oof. if you leave me in tokyo for a day, i’ll probably be able to get by fairly well and happily work my way around without trouble, but i ultimately think it will be mortifying and insulting for everyone involved for me to ever claim i Speak-speak japanese — so honestly, no. i do not 😅</div>

 <div class=question>hello hello im back bc KJHGKSHKGS oh m god. i cant believed we ever shared a Thought but i also cant believe u actually planned on including it in skow somehow (which, btw, if u had actually done it i probably wouldve been unable to reply to this due to having passed away). i know you have already said that skow was the closing act for flls itafushi but i would gladly read any any anything from that universe to feed more of my hourly thoughts on it. im just beyond GLAD that you have confirmed the existence of that hc so please take my most sincere thank yous. here they go!<br>if i try to comment on all of the other hcs you have raised i would spend the week on your cc but just know that my heart at this very moment is holding itself together from exploding by a hair's breadth after yuuji&amp;baby&amp;sandcastles and megumi being the first one to hold them outside of their parents. it is an understatement to say that both megumi watching yuuji responding to the baby as he feeds them AND yuuji finding megumi and the little kid asleep at peace changed my life; those are images that will live rent free in my head for probably the next decade.<br>"just this huge family it doesn't have to learn to appreciate or understand". god. i rmr something you wrote in flls about gojo being (along with toji) megumi's parental figure and how megumi was "a child to watch over and take care of, yes, but a child who could make the same mistakes, and as such was expected to not. a child who was given a different kind of upbringing and should have come out of it unscathed, yet did not"; i think that they all have this in mind now–not only megumi and gojo but everyone in that big web of connections that make up their family, along with yuuji and his own faulted (but as good as possible) upbringing–and they will try their best in their own different ways to give this new person a childhood that would provide them with everything they need whatever that may be. a fresh start for all of them, and im sure that means so so much to flls yuuji and megumi.<br>thank u for taking ur time to read and reply to this! im terribly sorry both ccs are huge kfghkghgt and OMG please don't cry about it!! your flls universe was one of the best things to ever happen to me and im eternally glad for being able to keep it and its hcs with me forever. thank u thank u thank u &lt;3 i appreciate u so much, i truly do. wish u all the best as well!!</div>

 <div class=reply>it was a beautiful thought 😔and oh god i do feel more much more done with this universe after skow than i did when i finished flls the first time, even though i was pretty stubborn back then too about not writing more for it, and look what happened a couple months later. so. i said in another cc that i know that by the end of skow, i’ve left them at a place where i can trust them to move forward without it needing it to be a story. but this universe will have a special place in my heart, eternally, and it doesn’t hurt to imagine sometimes how they do that moving forward. even if i don’t write another full flls universe fic, there’s always catharsis in writing lil scenes in my notes and answering ccs like yours. so thank you for your thanks, and trust me when i say i feel so moved &amp; validated to know people also have these thoughts about flls itafushi. <br><br>YUUJI AND BABY AND SANDCASTLES. another thing i’m a little regretful over about the format i chose for skow is that i couldn’t do stuff farther into the future. if i could, i def would have wasted a scene just talking about the ways that yuuji acclimates to the yearly okinawa trip. the concept is just so representative to me of all the family adjacent themes present in both megumi and yuuji’s arcs, and i’d have loved to write about what yuuji’s integration into the family over time means for them both. then you bring the baby into it, too, and i just. want to put my head in my hands. a child who won’t ever know an okinawa trip without yuuji in it, who’ll live their whole life knowing yuuji as their uncle’s significant other. as just another family member. i’m living for the inevitable day that they ask either yuuji or megumi how they got together and gets treated to three years’ worth of pre-relationship. bonus points if they make it a mission to piece together as much of the story from as many family members as possible, even nobara &amp; maki, in a way that megumi never did about stsg. when he finds out about the kid asking around, he just tells tsumiki, they got that from you. don’t tell me that’s not how you were when you asked shoko sensei about gojo sensei and getou san.<br><br>but i’m way off track here. yes. exactly. it’s interesting bc the core of what happened with megumi is that you’ve got two parental figures who have a lot of hurt in their childhoods, and unwittingly it ended up affecting him even when neither toji nor gojo meant for it to, and in fact tried their best in their own ways to give megumi the best childhood they could imagine, to give him what they thought he needed. and that Still failed. so yes, i really love imagining that megumi’s the generation where that Does stop, where it IS finally different. and you’re right. it means so, so much to yuuji &amp; megumi, most of all. <br><br>i'm out of space but again thank you from the bottom of my heart and i wish you all the best in return ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>heyyy im actually here to ask u abt something kinda personal? idk? but it's something that i concluded after reading both flls and skow and realizing the IMMENSE knowledge u have about japan–especially (mainly) about regions and places and neighborhoods and everything geographic. have you ever been there? do you get that knowledge from animes or mangas or any form of media? do you research a lot? it's funny because a scene from skow i can remember now that helped me get to that conclusion is the one yuuji is making meatballs for he and megumi and there's music coming from a bluetooth speaker yuuji won from a giveaway in akihabara–and i can't imagine how one would look up "places in tokyo which would likely host a giveaway" dkfjkshjrkh<br>anyways yeah! its absolutely fine if you don't wanna share that tho!! i've just been wondering, given that that's something so present in those fics which make them seem somehow more real, like im actually there (bc, since im much of a visual learner, i can look up the places and play out the scene so vividly in my mind ihih). i would also like to praise for that then i guess! it goes beyond saying that you've become my number one favorite author in the present moment so yeahhhhhsdkhf! that's all, i hope ure well &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>OH NO I WOULDN’T SAY IMMENSE. i’ve unfortunately never been there, but i just. really like places. not to mention that if you consume enough media set in the same country / area / place, ofc you start picking up the elements that define certain cities, neighbourhoods, even streets, and you can mix it in with canon things as well as in-fic characterization. which was the case with the bluetooth speaker in skow! i know akihabara has a reputation for being a particular kind of shopping district, and that happens to include electronics + megumi &amp; yuuji do canonically go to akihabara in the first light novel + i just thought yuuji would definitely be joining streetside giveaways for random free stuff. hence that one throwaway line; it’s prob an unnecessary detail, but sometimes details like that do help make the world more complete for me just as much as landmark imagery.<br><br>but a lot of it is research, certainly. friends who had to be around me while i was writing flls joke about how i didn’t outline anything plot-wise but signed up for real estate sites to figure out how big a house in tokyo can reasonably be and what a floor plan for the gojo-geto home might look like, then again for yuuji’s apartment hunting in ch 6 &amp; megumi’s funabashi place. which. again. prob unnecessary. but. it’s just overall fun for me as well. and it helps me keep track in my head of where to put people in. if characterization is about reaction, then it goes to say that part of characterization is that individual’s relationship with the city around them. add to that the fact that cities have whole heartbeats of their own. or at least i think so. it’s a theme i always find myself writing, at least, as someone with no real city to call home; it’s not as prominent in flls as compared to a couple much older fics, but bottomline is that i just love building and mapping out cities in my head for a story. <br><br>which — speaking of — a lot of the spots in the early flls chapters are actually places i’ve written about before! i’m always laziest when starting a story and didn’t wanna do research from scratch, so i ended up building the early flls world mostly around the university of tokyo &amp; disneyland bc i have remnant bits of info on the surrounding area from when i was writing about them in 2016. so it’s really just luck and a love for the role that places play in human lives, and beyond that, i can always thank google maps for being patient with me while i try to find the best route from harujuku to disneyland via subway that i can use for one scene. <br><br>anyway, i’ve been an ongoing crisis these days about how my worldbuilding is very, very Not Good, and reading you say that places in flls have moments where they feel real made me so happy i had to go for a lap around the living room. thank you so, so much for this cc.</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you so so much! i want to say i do try to be as thorough as possible, and while i’m not sure if it works most of the time, i very much appreciate you saying this. it’s so thoughtful in multiple definitions of the word, and it’s just rewarding to know someone thinks that :( and ohhhhhh i’m always thrilled to hear about people starting blue period! the video essay i tweeted really captures the feel and soul of it, i think, so i’m glad it prompted you to check out blp. i hope the read has been going well for you and that you like the video if you ever do watch it! <br><br>as for video essay recs, thank you for asking !! i can try !! but i have to put my answers on a separate place to add all the links and bits without making things rough for both myself &amp; the ccat rules, unfortunately, so i’ll link a tumblr post here: https://sleeptowns.tumblr.com/post/660441713216831488/video-essays-nonfiction-poetry-etc-typed-up-a<br><br>let me know if you can’t access it or if there any problems with it at all! thank you so much for welcoming me back and i hope you have a lovely week 🌷</div>

 <div class=reply>HEY WHAT IN THE HECK THIS IS SO NICE ??? it was one of my most anticipated netflix releases for the summer !! i saw the trailer and was enamoured on the spot, and it’s a feat in itself that i watched it as soon as it dropped when it usually takes me whole months to get to things. of course i have my little fishbones to pick with it, as with anything, but it was such a visually stunning little film at the end of it all, and it means so much to hear that it reminded you of me and my writing, oh my god. the vibes were just so… sweet? that i couldn’t even fault it for some of the things it wasn’t giving me enough of. i saw a review that was like “it’s not likely to leave you with a lasting impact, but it’s a brief, pleasant watch—like a cool breeze on a hot summer day” and i think that’s my conclusion as well. i have the softest, softest spot for the ending sequence in particular, and i adored cherry from the moment we met him. i definitely want more where this movie came from ahhh <br><br>thank you so so much for this and sending you love right back 🤍🌸</div>

 <div class=reply>hi !! thank you so much !! i don’t know about enjoyable, but i’ve definitely been able to fill my days with a few rewarding things here and there despite all the stuff going on; thank you for your sweet, sweet well wishes. they moved to tears a little bit there, not gonna lie. you’re too kind. <br><br>and damn oh my god what an intriguing question. i’m so pleased to be asked (and so relieved to hear that you vibe with my understanding of them) but also worried i’m unequipped to answer well when i’ve been on a tug of war with jjk for the past couple of months? but. i guess i’ll write a short little letter to both of them as a pair in honour of how much i miss them 😔<br><br>to canon yuuji &amp; megumi — you’re only boys. i say that with as much love as i do grief. i’m sorry that this isn’t something you have been allowed to be. i’m sorry that the one time you allow yourself a choice, however selfish, however selfless, it spiralled into so many messes stacked upon each other. and thank you, as well, because it is so easy to regret one heat of the moment choice, and yet you don’t. that no matter all the things you want to take back and run away from and protect, you haven’t yet regretted saving each other. you both carry so much, not least of which the weight of each other’s life and wellbeing. and i worry that this means it’s inevitable you’ll lose each other one way or another. i can only hope that if the time comes, both of you know that there have always been people who wanted you safe and alive without you having to repay it with world-ending goodness. that you never had to justify being in this world, no matter who has left you or no matter what someone has left with you. <br><br>and to flls yuuji &amp; megumi — i’m sorry for what i put you through, though to be fair i had no idea that you would make as much a home out of my heart as you did of each other’s and force my hand into writing 100k more words than i intended. i’ve never even been properly in love, much less been in a relationship like yours, and i’m a cynic about so many things, with incredibly few things i trust to be forever, so believe me when i say it shocked me more than anyone to find your story and your love to be what it became. that said, i have nothing left to tell you that i don’t trust you two to already know or be able to figure out amongst yourselves. i know you’ll take care of yourselves and each other. i know that your love is endless. i’ll love and miss you forever, likely for as long as i write, but it’s enough of a goodbye for me, knowing what is enough for you. thank you for letting me be a part of your love and growth. and because it won’t become a curse for me to tell you two this — live well. be happy. you’ve got it from here.<br><br>and cut. insert all the finger guns here. this was strangely cathartic, so again, thank you for the q. i also wish you the best always! stay safe and take care 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi - i know this is very random, but i just really wanted to say something about flls. thank you? i've read and reread it many, many times now instead of focusing on my uni lectures and i have never felt more... seen, i guess? in saying that, i really relate a lot to megumi and how his mindset works in your fic (also yuuji too) and i will never get enough of the way the fic makes me feel. i only want more every time i read it, because you captured everything very perfectly and you described them exactly how i imagined they'd be non-canon. many scenes just hit very close to home. i also listen to the playlist very often, too. every song fits them perfectly. i find myself hearing every song, thinking, "oh, this song remind me of chapter 4" and so on, and i love that. this is really long, i just wanted to say thank you for sharing flls. it has easily become a number 1 favorite for me. <br><br>i hope your week treats you kindly, and i hope you take care of yourself.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no not at all, thank you so much !! this slapped a well-needed smile onto my face + brought a lot of gentler warmth as well. it means a lot to know that you were able to relate to the flls characters in such concrete ways, that it might have felt real to you the way that i want to say it did to me. and you listen to the playlist too! that’s so, so nice! sometimes i decide to listen to it on a whim and get hit all over again by how much affection i have for the flls universe, so it’s always great to hear someone else is listening to the songs and thinking of the story as well. <br><br>i also hope you are taking care of yourself, and that the coming month is kind to you ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>hello!! this is my first time writing to you and i don't usually do this but as a writer myself, i admire you greatly. your writing is absolutely gorgeous and breath-taking, the way you write your characters makes it feel so real to me and i'm appalled. if it's not too much, may i ask where you get your inspiration from? i'm a synesthete so i generally draw inspiration from music and i'm guessing that might be where you get ideas from too? i noticed your twitter is unavailable but i've been wanting to get in contact with you for a while (don't worry, it's nothing weird, it's just like a "oh they're cool, i wish i could follow their interests yk?) so hey! maybe drop me a reply when you're back on social media :D <br><br>also! how long does it take for you to finish a 100k word piece? it's one of my goals too and the one i've been writing as of now has taken me about a month! <br><br>i can't put into words how great of a person you are, seriously. sometimes i think i admire you than people in the professional field themselves (sorry if that's too big of a compliment, don't really want to make you feel uncomfortable after i've read your carrd). we're rooting for you, cityboys :^</div>

 <div class=reply>hello and thank you so much for writing to me !! how kindly and generously at that, to boot. you give such high praise here, you truly, seriously do (and i appreciate you prefacing your compliments in case it made me uncomfortable, which i assure you it did not); i’m rolling around in the warmth that this message made me feel. <br><br>and you’re a synesthete ahhh that’s super cool of you to share with me! in terms of inspiration, even though i work with prose fiction most often, i think i gravitate towards visual and sometimes audio storytelling — films, the occasional tv show, graphic novels, anime and manga, paintings and sculpture, etc. as pretentious as that sounds to me to list. i feel like i tend to be indulgent with building setting and making sure characters are always moving, and i very much love a loaded dialogue-heavy scene with careful-ish blocking. which in turn informs the structure of my fics, if only bc dialogue &gt; introspection &gt; setting, i realize now, are the three pillars of any story i try to write. it’s always one of those three that starts a scene, until that scene becomes a story full of multiple scenes, and if anything at all, ideas for them tend to be sparked by visual mediums. <br><br>as for how long it takes to finish a ~100k word piece, it tends to depend. though on what, i’m not really sure 😅 i recently looked back at my 80k fic from 2017, and it looks like every chapter took around a day to write? that definitely wasn’t the case with flls, where most of the chapters were around 20k and took me around three to five days to complete each. so counting the many discarded drafts for full chapters, i guess it doubled how long it took to “finish” flls. not to mention that if flls wasn’t a fic and instead something that went through proper editing rounds and outlining, that would have taken even longer. personal preference wise, though: on average, a month to two months would be an ideal timeline for a 100k word piece! but that’s not really realistic with other stuff going on so. it’s really just. find the momentum that works for you and ride the wave. from experience, i don’t really think fast work necessarily turns out great work, and that sometimes it’s harmful to be so caught up trying to get to the complete product that you breeze past the small details you could have sat with a little longer. or maybe you miss out on an opportunity for growth bc you’re putting words on the page without really writing. that kind of thing. but other people also like to have a full rough draft and go back from there so — at the end of the day, go at the pace that best serves you and what you’re writing. (and, if i may, from what bits you’ve told me, it seems you’re doing really well! and that’s really thrilling to hear!)<br><br>but yes — i’m back on twitter as of today! thank you for looking for me, and i wish you all the best with life and writing 💗</div>

 <div class=question>this is very embarrassing to ask but have you read the raven cycle? because i could’ve sworn i saw an ask of you briefly mentioning you’d read it but now i cannot find it for the life of me and i’m wondering if i made it up, which would be embarrassing. anyways, i would like this ask to not be completely pointless if my brain made it up so let me also say in looking for that ask i found you saying you loved the kite runner, which i also loved!!! what a great book!!! it was a read for my english class and the best essay mark i ever got and was also a deeply personal book to me. okay, hope you have a great day!!</div>

 <div class=reply>no no no i promise you’re not tripping, i have mentioned it a couple of times here! yes, i’ve read it, and it continues to be one of those things i feel a lot for on a personal level. lots of things about it i choose to overlook and forgive it for, probably, but the affection just runs that deep even years later [insert finger guns] — but anyway, was there a particular reason trc came to mind?<br><br>and yes to kite runner as well !! i was so young when i read it but whatever i understood of it back then rerouted my little seven year old brain and i don’t even think it’s far-fetched to say it’s one of the main reasons i write the way i do now. i’ve reread it periodically since (though it’s been a while since my last one) but yeah… yeah. and ahhh i’m all giddy to hear it was in your list for class! that’s great! i had to talk my way into choosing this book for class back in high school, but that was very much one of my favourite essays to write and it was worth it. it’s really nice to hear a book that’s deeply personal to me is deeply personal to someone else as well. so thank you so much for sharing this. i hope you have a great day as well &lt;3</div>

 <div class=question>hi there!! i hope ure well! im here bc ive been having these thoughts for a whole day and decided to ask my favorite author on the ao3 platform their opinion on the matter……! soooo im rereading ffls after finishing skow and i cant stop thinking abt your itafushi (and tbh any universe itafushi) with kids!<br><br>this is how the hcs go: maybe its tsumiki and her husband who have brought a child into that Big family—or maybe literally any pairing or adult—, but in anyway theres this new tiny person that accompains them to okinawa and ofc yuuji is gna make sure he feeds them well; it would be so fun and endearing to see megumi n yuuji babysitting the kid for a day? an afternoon? a few hours?; the two of them buying baby gifts for whenever they visit the gojo&amp;getou house; the Classic yuuji or megumi realization when staring at the other playing with/feeding/carrying the kid and being Woah This Is Really The Person I Love My Favorite Person; and idk just the two of them being part of this little human’s growth and all of the implications that process has in their development as a person and as two people together.<br><br>this is just me placing these hcs somewhere tbh dhjdjfd i absolutely looooove the flls universe and i think abt them daily so this is just a sample of what goes on in my brain! thank u thank u always i admire ur work so much! i hope that things are getting better wherever you are and that you’re staying safe! lots of love &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>okay no lets talk about this bc these are also thoughts i have had and i wanted to include it in skow somehow but then i didn’t bc it felt like i was moving them too fast or like i was being too shameless after everything i threw at them before they got together or maybe i was doing too much about them being each other’s person when yuuji literally already said exactly that in the last chapter of flls and that to do more than skow was Already doing in its nearly all its other scenes was to be in danger of making it sound disingenuous etc etc but anyway i can confirm this happens in the flls universe. i may not necessarily write it, but if it’s existent in both our minds, then that makes it a thing and i’m signing on it. <br><br>god, you raise such lovely concepts here. megumi and yuuji always offer to take care of the kid when they’re in okinawa bc they know it’s the few days of the year that tsumiki and her husband get to have some time off from being full time parents, at least in the first few years of the child growing up and needing constant watching. and when the child gets a little older and can waddle out to the beach with them. all the sandcastles yuuji builds with them, all the photos gojo and nanako take and send megumi after, the slow but sure ways megumi learns to be more open with the love he’s felt for his sister’s child from the moment he first got to hold them. i’d like to imagine megumi was the first person that got to hold the baby outside of tsumiki and her husband. he’s undone by it completely when the baby opens their little eyes and blinks at him. <br><br>and all the how to articles and youtube tutorials megumi and yuuji watch Just In Case they have to babysit, the things they’re ready to drop as soon as tsumiki needs them to come to saitama for a day, even though she rarely does. the many little disasters narrowly missed, yeah, but also. megumi watching from across the table, heart expanding to bursting, while yuuji listens intently to the toddler’s half unintelligible babbling and responding to them with all his attention as he feeds them, or yuuji walking back into the living room and finding megumi and the child both asleep, the baby breathing quietly on his chest and his arm curled protectively around them even in sleep, and being so at peace it makes his heart feel like it’s cracking.<br><br>just a child growing up with love without it coming in the aftermath of something. no childhood lack, nothing taken away. just this huge family it doesn’t have to learn to appreciate or understand. what the existence of a small creature like that will do for flls yuuji and megumi. <br><br>also i can’t believe someone has an hc about the flls universe. i know you said this is applicable to any itafushi, but that’s unreal. i can cry about it. i couldn’t keep myself together long enough to write this answer properly. my god. i’ll have to cut myself off here but thank you so much for this and i wish you all the best 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>as long as it’s for yourself, i’m super okay with it! (and flattered that you’ll want to.) it’s only if someone’s trying to profit off any of my fics that i’ll of course have to take issue, but since it doesn’t sound like the case at all here, please feel free to do so. also: a friend of mine had very kindly put together flls into a book, so if you’d like a copy of the pdf she used for printing, i’ll be happy to send that over to you somehow!<br><br>lastly: p l e a s e the sound i made when i read the last part of your message good god thank you?? so?? much??? that’s an extremely, extremely generous comparison to make what the hell i’ll be floating on clouds for a good while !! thank you !!</div>

 <div class=question>i just need you to know that the line ”i’m sorry that i loved you in silence” is the like, simultaneously the most beautiful and heartbreaking thing i’ve ever heard and it lives in my head RENT FREE. literally was buttering my toast this morning and remembered that is a line of dialogue someone wrote and felt pain. but the good kind of pain, where something is so good it hurts. basically, what i’m trying to do is compliment you on your writing talents and ability to really understand human emotions and more complicated relationships and feelings and being able to articulate them so well in your writing.</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhhh that line is memorable for me as well! i know it wasn’t said in the sweetest or kindest of circumstances, but i distinctly remember typing it before i even wrote the rest of megumi’s monologue in that scene and knowing it’s the one sentence i won’t ever want to cut out, no matter what i’ll have to do to keep it. it’s so rare for me to write a lone piece of a story and feel immediately and cleanly satisfied with it, but i do think i was with this one sentence. it felt like that was the moment that this fic finally got to breathe, and so it was also the moment i knew what the fic even was and how it will end and that i’ll be okay posting it — so thank you so, so much for noting it and taking the time to leave a message for me about it. and for being so kind with your compliments. it means a great deal to hear what you choose to highlight about my writing, and it really makes the heart swell.</div>

 <div class=question>do you think you’ll ever write out some notes about your bnha fics? like, what you were thinking at the time you wrote them or what you really wanted to portray with the relationships? i absolutely love your tddk fics. yours, mine, ours is especially a favorite i often come back to, and since you’ve said you’ve grown as a writer since then, i think it would be so interesting to hear your thoughts! i just love listening to writers talk about their writing haha.</div>

 <div class=reply>one day i’d love to do a full reread and commentary on them! i’ve gotten a handful of people reading flls then going back to read the bnha fics as well, and i often find myself trying some verbal gymnastics to figure out how they feel about any differences there. a lot of it is me being brutal on my younger self, i think, but also. god. it’s really interesting. my bnha and jjk fics are nearly five years apart. that’s So many years. that’s a lot of changes in storytelling perspective, even if the underlying vibe might still be the same. i also don’t know if grown necessarily means better, but i definitely look for other things now, and while i probably won’t be able to approximate what i was thinking when i wrote them, exactly, it would still be nice to see what choices i made back then and what i’d do differently now, or why i chose the relationships i did back then and why i portrayed them the way i did, etc. it would also foster a bit more kindness to the stuff i was writing from 15 to 19 years old, plus it would just be fun, seeing as i don’t think i’ve ever gone back to reread any of my bnha fics. so yes, yes, yes, that’s definitely something i’d love to do at some point, thank you so much for asking. <br><br>and oh my god, i get so thrilled whenever someone has ymo as a favourite !! or at least something they reread !! it + flls are easily the fics i hesitated the most about posting, so it’s just such a huge surprise every time. it’s so lovely every time to see it mentioned. <br><br>overall, thank you so much and i hope you’re taking care ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>so, i know you talked about your writing process, and i’ve read all your reflective notes about your jjk fics, but ig i was wondering how you decide what you want to write? or, how do you go about breaking down a character and their traits/layers? then how do you decide what aspects of their character you want to portray or explore more of? a goal of mine is write more character-study-type fics, but i honestly don’t really know how to go about it. the way you talk about your fics and their introspection is so, like, elegant? and you articulate yourself really well, i thought you’d be a great person to ask :)</div>

 <div class=reply>this q has been sitting in my inbox for, like, a month and even now all i can think of every time i start typing a reply is just... vague but expansive hand gestures<br><br>it’s so nice of you to ask, but my honest answer is, again, hand and arm flailing that devolves into hesitant but passable breakdancing. it’s a little bit of some things, a little bit of others. but in most cases, i don’t really go into a fic having made up my mind re: what layers to write about. it’s too big and too decided, and i like to start small and work my way up. often, that looks like: picking a setting &amp; the dramatis personae of the scene, and just improv-ing my way through that. sometimes, the first draft of the scene works; most times, it doesn’t, but at least i get dialogue bits i think are strong enough to guide me towards what purpose a scene would serve. once i have dialogue, i’m able to fill in the introspection that end up stuffed between the spoken lines in the published work. dialogue is usually the easiest part for me, since it’s based on tangible stuff like how they talk + body language + expressions we see them make. it’s like acting As the character, that part of writing. or at least doing an snl impression of them. when i have these down, i get to write the ~character study parts of the scenes, which is really just me looking at the page and examining Why i had them saying this or that. it’s just writing the thought process that led them to one specific sentence they said, and the next, and so on, and supplementing that with references to canon parallels or prev scenes. if anything, the story decides what traits and aspects are highlighted instead of me strong-arming the story to contain what i want it to. maybe not always, but most of the time. <br><br>that said, maybe a good place to start with getting used to ✨analyzing characters ✨ is just. a reaction. even if it’s just writing a canon fic that breaks down one scene, i think characterization feels the most within grasp when the character you’re looking at is reacting to smth and/or to someone else. bc then you get to ask the whys and hows of a complex human being, fictional as they are. it gives you the jumping off point of “why did they make this face in this one moment” or “why did they choose to do This and, critically, not That” or “why is this the exact phrasing they used.” then u can start applying qs like that on a broader sense, until it’s “what in their lifetime contributed to them reacting to this life event/relationship the way they did,” etc.<br><br>i’m at word limit but! last notes: this is a possible starting point &amp; not a rule that i have any authority to give! tysm for reading my lil writing notes! i am so so so So sorry for how ungodly late this reply is! please take care!</div>

 <div class=question>hey! i was wondering how you balance writing your fanworks with your original work and job-related stuff. everything you post is so lovely and well thought out- how do you avoid compromising each individual work? do you work on original and fandom work simultaneously or do one at a time? (also i loved flls SO much but it threw me violently back into my mitski phase + almost made me cry on public transport lol thank u for writing!!)</div>

 <div class=reply>oh wow thank you so so so much 🤍 and how cool is this of you to ask !! the only thing i can say confidently off the bat is that it’s very rare for me to do original and fan work together. it’s not a never, and i’ve done it before — but i don’t think i can do it now, with how much my writing stamina has deteriorated since 2017 dsjshs in general, though, i like to work on things one at a time! i may start multiple projects all at once, but once i commit to a thing, it pretty much takes over whatever space i don’t delegate to social / job / school life, etc. so i write primarily for that one work, whether it’s a fic or an original project. <br><br>and hmm i’m not sure if i’m necessarily good at balancing writing time with other things in my life so much as i’m just. a bit obsessive and a lot workaholic. which is not behaviour i want to condone nor encourage bc i also know the burnout it can lead to. but these days, i mostly just try to write whenever i am able to write. that doesn’t mean i Always write, bc sometimes the energy isn’t there or the momentum isn’t starting up or sometimes i just don’t have time in a day or week, at which point i think it would be more detrimental to even attempt writing, but there are also times where i find myself with a few extra hrs of free time &amp; forcibly tackle whatever chooses to come out on the page. it isn’t often good, but it’s something, and i have to tell myself something is more to work with than nothing, even if this isn’t always true either and i’d have to start a whole new draft of a chapter the next time i write anyway. so. i don’t know. in terms of balancing writing with life, i think it’s really just me gritting my teeth when i must and letting it go otherwise. push and pull until one side gives.<br><br>that said, i do think my work is plenty ~compromised! i’m impatient with timeline + my attention span is laughable, so i always want to be done with a thing within a couple of months while my love for it is still fresh and overrides whatever frustration i might accumulate. (flls took me 4 months, which is double how long it took me to write any of my other fics, and i was in really temperamental shape at the end of it. it wasn’t cute.) the impatience means i’m not able to do proper substantial editing, or proofread thoroughly. i did try to give myself more space in between writing flls chs — but again. a story of that size prob could benefit from eyes fresher than i had. <br><br>on that note, then, i hope you know it means the world for you to say such lovely, thoughtful things about my work despite it all. i’m so, so sorry for the month’s delay in this reply + the mitski, thank you for reading flls, and i pray you’re staying well.</div>

 <div class=question>Hi again! I'm the anon that asked you about the literature that inspired you and your taste in writing. Thank you so much for your answer, and I totally understand it must be hard to elaborate further from "my answer gets more and more fragmentary and less and less accurate to what actually inspires me". It's cool, still. I asked that because I absolutely loved the way you weave from one paragraph to another and to the next, on and on. I loved the kind of writing that can make me learn more, in whatever small form such us technicalities, or knowledge that actually exists irl world. And I know to appreciate art and beauty don't always have to understand it, and it all depends on your own personal perspective, but when I come across writers with capabilities (or skills? I know a lot of burnt-out gifted kids out there loathed the term 'talent') as refined/delicate as you, I feel like it's such a blissful thing. So... again, thank you for answering. I hope I can learn even more from your creations in the future. Take good care of yourself, alright?</div>

 <div class=reply>hello again! i’ve been thinking a bit more about your question since last time bc i felt so bad about giving you something so insufficient, and i still don’t have a proper answer, necessarily, but if we’re just talking about technical style, i will say that while my writing tone may not be inspired by novels, i do think — if i can even say this so subjectively and shamelessly — that i sometimes write in a way that reflects a structure more better suited towards nonfiction? so like. essays and profiles and newsletters, of which i read (and at times write) a lot. it doesn’t translate smoothly to fiction prose all the time, in retrospect, and the result is that i tend to get maybe too wordy and introspective in my fics, but. yeah. thank you, for being so nice about my paragraph weaving. as far as that goes, i think nonfiction writers &amp; journalists are unparalleled in structuring their words to make a point, etc. sometimes i even find that nonfiction is miles better at handling emotion than fiction. but that’s a different tangent altogether. my main point is: i’ve likely internalized a lot of things gleaned and learned from nonfiction, so if i can go back to my last reply to you, the much shorter and accurate answer will be that i love essayists and critics and column writers with all my heart, and with how i write right now, their way of writing is most likely the closest i get to feeling ~inspired. if inspired is even the right word.<br><br>that said, thank you so much for thinking of me and my work so, so, So generously. sorry for always being so long-winded about these answers 😅i wish you all the best, please take good care of yourself as well, and to tweak your thought a little without centering myself, i think it’s a beautiful thing for you to point out how blissful it is to have art we can appreciate.</div>

 <div class=question>hello there !! i hope you're having a wonderful day !! ♥ flls is being showered with so much love and i couldn't stop myself to add onto that pile and sending an ask your way to express how much it touched me. throughout reading i felt like i was in the relationship with them as funny and silly as that sounds. the way you wrote itafushi made them so real, so so so human and everything they felt i also felt.. it was a rollercoaster of emotions and i could not thank you enough for writing and sharing that story with us. i adore your writing so much i don't think i can fully express in my limited vocabulary how incredible it was to be taken on that journey (much like others i see)...<br><br>instead to thank you with what little i have, i will leave you with a song recommendation that so very describes the way they reconnect in chapter 7 (if you haven't heard it already !!) it's called "from me, the moon" by lav. <br><br>i was listening to your curated playlist after i finished flls and just sat in silence trying to reimagine everything that i just read from itafushi's perspective and was just super immersed.. so i had to give a listen to a break up playlist i made last year and just stumbled on that song. i hope you love it as much as i do! my favorite line from it is "is the moon still in love with the sun?" and the outro, omg the outro... very very flls itafushi.<br><br>anyways thank you for taking time out of your day to read this, i will cherish flls forever !!!!!! ♥</div>

 <div class=reply>hello and thank you !! i hope you are having a wonderful day as well !! and no oh my god i don’t think that’s silly at all? if anything, i believe there’s much to commend about you being so open to the story that you felt connected to their fictional little lives. being a reader takes a lot of empathy, i think. someone once told me that my work ends once i’ve put the words on the page and sent that page out to the world, and the rest is for readers to let themselves feel and acknowledge — and like. i don’t always believe it, because i think a lot does depend on me doing my end of the bargain right, but. in this case, hearing that (it seems) you’ve done a lot of that feeling about flls, i’m just nothing short of thankful that you empathized with the story to the point that its characters felt as real and human to you as i wanted them to be. that their story became your story, too, in a way. there’s legitimately nothing more fulfilling to hear ❤️<br><br>and ahhhh this song! it’s been recommended to me on spotify every now and then but i’ve never actually sat down and listened to it until now. i’m so glad this cc had me doing just that. it’s such a sparse, heartfelt little song and so lovely that it makes me feel like a chunk of my chest cavity is missing. the opening with “two years and you still look the same / wide blinking eyes look at me the same way” had me Gasping, and the outro with “to the first boy who lit me a flame / does your heart still remember my name?” i’m clawing at my face why is my heart skipping whole beats for a story i literally wrote<br><br>that said, if it’s okay with you, i had to add it to the flls playlist. thank you so much for listening to it, for thinking of me &amp; flls with this song, and for having all these tenderness for the story itself. i wish you a good week, stay safe, and again, thank you, thank you, thank you.</div>

 <div class=question>hi, I’m gonna start this off by saying it is way too late at night for me to be writing this (definitely don’t have work tomorrow 🤡) so i’m sorry that these words will probably not be enough to sum up how i feel, but I just finished flls and before i forget i wanted to send this while everything was still fresh. to start, found your fic from an artist on twitter(ni juu ni sai) and saw it was linked to a fic, so i came in honestly just wanting to read about itafushi fluff and feelings. but i left loving this story, the characters—not even just including fushigoro and itadori—and this whole jjk universe even more. you added so much more perspective to these two stupid dorks and the people surrounding their lives. and at the root of everything, even though it’s been said before i’ll say it again, it was because your writing was so incredibly well-spoken and raw. i knew from the moment i read itadori’s first therapy session that this would be one of those fics that would stick with me for a long time, because, god, the way you describe emotions and their thoughts, the way you set the mood of the scene, the banter of the characters, the timing in their dialogue (the amount of tears that were shed at the end of the sixth chapter)—all of it was so painfully realistic and some of it even hit home, but it was all done so beautifully. there’s so much to mention and ill be honest, it had been so so long since i had read something that made me feel this way <br><br>so i guess tldr, i just wanted to say thank you so so much for putting the work you did into this universe, for sharing this to the internet, and for making me love jujutsu kaisen, itadori, megumi, (and mitski!) a million times more. i would reexperience this fic again if i could</div>

 <div class=reply>OH NO i hope you were fine at work the next day! or that you at least managed to catch up on sleep when you got back? i’m incredibly touched that you took a moment to write to me despite the time, even when you didn’t have to, and that you did so with so much heart and precision. thank you for your kind words about the smaller technicalities of my writing (it’s always so, so nice to hear what details come across to the person reading), and beyond that, thank you as well for your loving words about the flls universe. this world means a great, great deal to me, and it makes me so many levels of giddy to hear that it might have come alive for you, too, if even a little, in the degree that i think this world and its characters will always be alive and vivid somewhere in the back of my mind. <br><br>thank you for checking out flls — and i am indebted to ni juu ni sai too at that — and for finding something in it worth your time and emotions. i truly can’t express enough of my gratitude, but please know that it’s there and that it’s endless.</div>

 <div class=question>Hi! I hope everything is going well with you! I just came here to tell you that I finished reading some kind of we recently and it was EXACTLY what I needed to read right now—it really made my week &lt;3 How is it that you always manage to drop new stuff right when I need it? I actually found flls before I even got the email in my inbox you'd posted it, because I just happened to be late-night lonely-hours thinking "wow, I'm Really Craving some quiet intimacy and tenderness in my life right now... maybe I'll go reread yours mine ours for the sixteenth time this year lmao." And I went to your ao3 profile and—lo and behold! new content! Let me tell you, THAT whole experience straight-up made my entire MONTH. You always write such beautiful stories and to be honest your writing is a big part of what got me through quarantine because the way you write human interaction is just so gorgeous, and it really helped me out when I was at my loneliest. I guess it kind of gave me something to look forward to, if that makes sense? It reminded me of everything that could be good about the world again someday at a time when, to be honest, I really needed reminding. I'm so so grateful that I had my quarantine-induced bnha phase so that I could find your work when I did &lt;333<br><br>Oh ALSO I wanted to tell you that I've been listening to Saint Sister's new album Where I Should End on repeat at pretty much all hours since it dropped last Friday, including while I was reading skow, and I just feel such MASSIVE flls itafushi vibes radiating off the whole thing. Especially the last song (Any Dreams?) but really there are so many lines throughout all the songs that just SCREAM them to me, and the whole atmosphere reminds me of your writing style. I Cannot listen to the album without vibrating over it lmao so I thought I would share in case you were interested</div>

 <div class=reply>WAIT WAIT WAIT OKAY I HAVE SO MUCH I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS CC THAT I’M RUNNING AROUND THE PLACE TRYING TO PUT IT INTO ACTUAL WORDS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY TURN OUT INSUFFICIENT BUT<br><br>i am so so thrilled to hear that about skow! i had and still do have my doubts &amp; worries about it so i’m feeling borderline buzzed to know it made someone’s week. and your little anecdote about finding flls — and having read ymo — oh i’m all :( in the most pleasant way possible. this message is so sweet and personal and thoughtful and i’m really, really grateful you took the time to articulate all of this so beautifully. this will definitely be something to look back at on the worst days of my writing doubts. makes me feel like my writing holds weight beyond more than just myself, you know, to hear what it means to someone else. thank you.<br><br>AND NOW LISTEN. THE SAINT SISTER ALBUM YOU RECOMMENDED. I’M IN COMPLETE AND TOTAL LOVE. what a lovely, perfect little record. i’ve just been floating around listening to it since this cc came in, and it’s both flayed my heart and stitched it back up good as new. then eventually there was a point where i remembered the last part of this cc, where you made such a generous comparison to the flls vibes, and i got so choked up and teary-eyed. it was un-self-conscious and wonderful. thank you so, so much for all of this this and i’m sending you my endless fondness and well wishes.</div>

 <div class=question>i just read your voltron fic and I don't think anyone has ever asked you about it, or voltron in general so, uhm, thoughts?? don't get me wrong, I have been voltron free for. like 2 years and I hardly think about it and I know it's like.. joked about that we all have war stories from that fandom so I promise you I'm not expecting anything tender, and like maybe you've truly moved on but. I don't know, your fic kind of reminded me, it was meaningful, wasn't it? like yeah it was a shitshow, especially towards the end, but the way you wrote lance and keith loving each other, I don't know, I wish it had happened. I wish I could chase that feeling but maybe chase is the right word because I have no idea how to find anything I like in the probably 3000 Keith/lance fics on the web and I just... I don't know. I found myself for a second wishing we had a flls for voltron, like a college au that righted all the wrongs (which is the understatement of the year about that fic) and then there was no one else I could say that to, so I'm sending this ask I guess, against better judgement.</div>

 <div class=reply>no please i’m glad you sent this, and i’m sorry it’s taken me so long to put together a reply. ig i was waiting for more potent emotions to come back to me, smth fresher and in a way more honest than "[smokes pipe] voltron, huh… haven’t heard that name in years" but the truth is that it’s like looking back at a disastrous first relationship. if that rs was between me and a show. i latched onto vld during one of the absolute worst points of my life, and it remains prob the only hyperfixation for which i can say that it got me through a bad time by making it substantially worse. it was So toxic; there was so much love bombing in the beginning and then disappointment after disappointment cushioned by flashes of hope and then just resignation until i cut myself off after s7. <br><br>objectively, though, it isn’t wholly vld’s fault. that isn’t to absolve the showrunners so much as just saying that i think the show was victim to a lot of expectations that it just was never capable of meeting even from the get-go. i know it stands now as one of those iconic examples of awful baiting, but looking back, i have a hard time imagining what i even found promising about vld. though maybe part of it is that curse of a series giving you so little and yet still enough for you to want so much more that you start getting attached to what it Could be, and that could-be just never became something that the showrunners were able to write and provide. there’s a fair amount of hubris on both sides, if i want to be generous. <br><br>but with that said, i think my problem with vld now is that there was a point where it just felt cruel on a personal level. as if the cast &amp; the producers were being insidious for the sake of being petty. and that’s really what i find distasteful? esp when viewers were raising genuine concerns about representation, not just in terms of klance but lance being cuban, or shiro having ptsd. like, no, of course fans shouldn’t be prioritized in directing a show, but as a creator, i think there’s also the responsibility of making work that is in conversation with your audience and — i don’t know. it was a shitshow all around, in the show &amp; beyond. you’re completely right. yet. while i have a lot to say about vld and not enough space for it in this cc, in some corner of those thoughts too i know there was love &amp; grief &amp; so much personal attachment to lance that had me writing my one vld fic. i knew, writing it, that it wasn’t what we were going to get. and like. that’s fine. i don’t profess to be a better writer than the people with the netflix show. but as always, it’s that could-be that stings the worst. <br><br>i’m running out of space but. if you ever want to talk more abt vld or want any fic recs, please know that i welcome all your vld ccs. or dms, too, once i reactivate my twitter. it’s nice in its own way getting to talk about this.<br><br>hope your week treats you kindly.</div>

 <div class=question>hello!! i got to know about your fics a couple of months ago (flls) and got obsessed with your writing style, so i read and finished 2AM yesterday... you probably dont remember much about that fic, but the way you write about bk's struggle of wanting to leave your hometown as fast as you can, because you think that staying there will only stall your growth, plus the idea at the end of bk not thinking about home as a concrete thing, of being torn in between tokyo and musutafu... it really resonated with me man. i grew up in a small town away from most of my family, so i always knew i was going to move away when i got to college, also to move closer with the family i had but never really got close to... but it was so conflicting, as most of my life i built by myself was in that tiny town, most of what made me myself.... but still a very small town after all, where all of the thing i wanted to do wouldn't fit.... so i guess i just wanted to let you know that you writing has made me feel things hahaha aand really inspired me, so thank u a lot &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>jeez if i could send a sorry cupcake for how late every single one of these cc replies are, i really would, i’m sorry. there’s a lot going on here that made my heart swell so if i could just go through them rapid fire — thank you for reading flls, thank you for finding something you like in my writing style, thank you for reading 2AM, and thank you for taking the time to detail all of these thoughts &amp; feelings to me. <br><br>you’re right in me not really remembering much about that fic, but i also know i had maybe the most fun writing it among all the bnha fics? and it’s so enlightening and validating to hear about it in such a personal, emotional context here! i try very hard not to include any part of myself in the fics i post on cityboys, but 2AM in particular i think was the absolute closest to a total clean slate when i started. i had no point of connection to bakugo’s background and history in that fic, and i remember being really worried that i wasn’t seeing him with enough depth or that i wasn’t empathizing enough with what he was going through in that fic simply bc i had no point of reference. but there’s a lot to be said too in how 2 AM is my longest bnha fic, which i believe is testament to how drawn i felt towards his struggles as the main character in that. <br><br>my point is — it gives me a lot, lot, Lot of warmth to hear that 2AM resonated with you. that despite how i felt like i was rummaging around in the dark when writing that fic, it still has enough in it to ring true? if you don’t mind me saying so? really, thank you so much for sharing this with me. i really do feel a lot of fondness towards not just my own fic but also towards you and your situation. i hope things are well where you are right now, and or at least that they are on their way to being so, and i wish you all the best with all the things you want to do. not to sound like an advice columnist with this but i do want to point out the probable obvious that it’s a tricky, difficult thing being at a point of transition and all that uncertainty, so. i’m sending you love and luck, and again, thank you for sending me this ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>hello! I am not anyone you should concern yourself with - just someone who'd just read "here and where you are". besides my agonised sobs (I actually spent an hour crying over this one, which for me and fanfiction is so far a major record!!) I wanted to convey the fact that I think that your writing style and skill are absolutely phenomenal, and I just really wanted to compliment you. the amount of emotion you evoke through words is through the roof. thank you very much for blursing me with your amazing work.</div>

 <div class=reply>the beginning of this cc oh my god no don’t say that i’m<br><br>first of all, i am so sorry. holy shit. second, thank you for reading here and where you are. i sometimes get carried away thinking of it as a bit of a dark horse among my more romance-centric jjk fics so i’m always jolted when i remember that like. people have and will read it. or that i even wrote it. it’s a difficult fic though, and practically none of the emotion in it is necessarily happy — so it is a super, super pleasant surprise, to hear your thoughts about it. <br><br>ahhh i really am sorry for driving you to the point of tears, but thank you so much for your kind, kind words and i wish you all the best 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>I just finished the first volume and I can’t wait to pick up the next one! AND YES. I know exactly what you mean about being drawn to stories that are kind to their characters &amp; stories (this is also me encouraging you to go on your tangent because I’m super interested in what you have to say about it)!! I love how the conflict in BP is yatora vs his insecurities and growing as a person &amp; artist, because it feels soooo relatable. One of my favorite parts was at the winter prep school when yatora started to feel insecure about his abilities, he told himself to just have fun with the process of painting. It was such a sweet moment. Thank you for introducing me to the story, and I hope you’re doing well :) - ☼</div>

 <div class=reply>hello sunshine friend i hope you and your blue period read are both doing well! ☀️<br><br>also (please skip this tangent if you’d like, it gets a bit much) i often think it’s much harder to have both complexity AND compassion in your story than it is to draw complexity out of tragedy. i’m not sure how to put this without making claims that sound universal when nothing is ever universal in stories aside from storytelling itself, but. it leaves a bit of a bad aftertaste when it becomes clear to me that a creator doesn’t know how else to draw out emotion beyond angst fodder, may it be straight up character d—th or un-nuanced depictions of mental health or identity. there’s a lot of love lost there from me, i think, in the sense that i find it hard to respect storytelling that can’t even love the story it’s telling, whatever that might entail. and that’s not me saying that tragic / horrible / violent stories are bad as a rule and that only soft slice of life matters. like, i recently rewatched s2 of mp100 to reward myself as well as finally cracked down on reading chainsaw man, and i found both to have such incredibly kind storytelling albeit in service of vastly different narratives.<br><br>ig when i say kind i don’t necessarily mean warm and loving. i mean that i don’t care how awful things are going in the world of a story, whether by nature or by design; i think kindness is owed by a writer to their characters in that the most you can do for these people is treat them like the complicated creatures that they are without having to rely on suffering that you have to fabricate for them to keep the story going. if a creator can only feel emotionally connected to their characters through the bad things that happen to these characters — then i don’t think it’s for me. <br><br>and i also tend to disagree with the take that tragedy automatically equals depth, or that deeply philosophical stories can only exist in constant suffering. i think there’s suffering, and i think there’s having depth as a character / as a world / an idea, and Then i also think there are the million small things that exist between these two “truths.” therefore i think kindness, as a blanket term here, is in having the maturity to explore the small things: may it be all the complicatedness of grief or whether it’s as small-scale as that scene where yatora thinks to himself that just because he loves art doesn’t mean there won’t be days that it will be difficult, nor that it will always be fun.<br><br>that said god i loved the winter prep school so much. it never fails to make me feel all warm how simple the premise of bp is yet how consistently nuanced everything is. and ooba sensei + haruka + kuwana + the storylines yotasuke &amp; yuka had going on… i love them all so much <br><br>i have a handful of people to thank as well for introducing me to this story but as always, i’m really happy to know you picked it up!</div>

 <div class=question>Hello there! I'm currently reading the first chapter of First Love Last Spring, but I just gotta take a breather from how much I ADORE your writing style. <br>Truly. I can learn a lot from it, as an amateur writer myself, which is such an honor and a blessing. I'm just dropping here to say that tbh, and I hope I don't overwhelm you.<br>I saw that perhaps you've deleted/deactivated your twitter acc, but I hope life is treating you kindly right now! Also, may I know what kind of literatures that inspire you and your taste in writing? Thank you so much for taking the time to answer this ask! Have a good day.</div>

 <div class=reply>good god this cc is so extremely kind and i’m so late in replying i’m going to scream?? hi !! hello !! you are so wonderful for this !! thank you so, so much? that’s quite the sentiment to share with me; i’m really the one who’s honoured &amp; blessed. and if you did end up reading past the first chapter, i also hope you enjoyed the rest of flls.<br><br>as for your question, i feel like every time i get asked this my answer gets more and more fragmentary and less and less accurate to what actually inspires me but i will say that i don’t… think… that a lot of literature inspires me. which isn’t to say i don’t enjoy a whole bunch of them, because of course i have novels that i’ve devoured and hold close to heart, but when it comes to inspiration, recently i’ve found that there are very few pieces of what we consider to be “literature” (novels and the like, etc.) that i feel inspire me or that i aspire to, in the strict definitions of what those mean. <br><br>there are plenty of stuff outside of lit, however, that lean hard towards the sort of ✨storytelling ✨ i love and admire and Do aspire to. a lot of it is heavy on ~kindness to emotion and empathy to the complicatedness of human life and human nature and the human condition, as pretentious as that is to say. i like small-scale things. i like character more than i like plot. i bristle at the idea that human tragedy — while i agree to be often inevitable and senseless — has to come without compassion within a narrative just to make a point. but those are nuanced thoughts that come with their own caveats, and what i’m really trying to say is: there’s a particular category of what i think of as “kind, loving stories” — which includes films by hirokazu koreeda, seinen manga like blue period, josei manga like ikoku nikki, even a handful of songs by sleeping at last — that i’d consider to be an inspiration in the sense that Man, That’s What I Want To Write. This Is The Storytelling I Want To Be Doing. and that isn’t at all to take a dump on people that enjoy the opposite, but for the purposes of this answer, this is what i like and want to do. regardless of genre or writing style or medium. i know that’s not really an answer to your literature question, but i think that’s the best answer i can provide rn as far as inspiration goes 😅<br><br>thank you for this q, and i wish you a good start to your week.</div>

 <div class=question>Hello! I recently found your fic, “first love, late spring”, after someone recommended it on my tl. I got curious, and started reading it. It was a pleasant surprise to finish reading the first chapter, and then continue reading the entirety of it. It’s been a while, a little too long since I found a fic that made me feel this much; every word, every sentence, ever paragraph and chapter made me feel so, so much, it was both, tender and raw, and very hard to explain, but it left me tearing up for whole days. It made me think a lot, too. Your writing is beautiful, even more than that, and I’m thankful for having found such a treasure on my to.<br>I just wanted to say: thank you, thank you for writing such a beautiful story, thank you for sharing it. I don’t have words to express everything it made me feel, and how beautiful it was, all the way from the beginning to the end, so I can only say Thank you! Thank you so much!</div>

 <div class=reply>how many days late is this reply, oh my goodness, i’m so sorry. i’m starting to slowly make my way through all these ccs in the messiest order possible but — i wanted to say first, in no uncertain terms, that i’m super, super grateful for this lovely message. you’ve put so much heart into describing flls to me and it makes me feel all sorts of mushy to hear you describe it so… beautifully? in turn? and to feel so connected to how You connected with it? i always feel like i can’t see flls objectively, even after all this time, so it’s never not pleasantly surprising to hear people describe it with this much generosity. thank you so, so much 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>Oh wow, I can’t wait to see what chapter 20 is about if it’s your favorite :) I actually picked up the first volume today as a belated birthday gift to myself, and having the physical copy and seeing the colored pages and different artworks throughout the story is just… incredible. Ahhh this series is so breathtaking so far?? And so emotional and reassuring?? It feels like a hug. It’s funny how my first question to you was about the link between passion and talent, and Blue Period seems to be a whole series based around questions such as those :o Anyways, I hope life is treating you kindly right now.

 <div class=reply>ISN’T IT. i also picked up the first volume before i first started reading it, and i do want to credit that at least in some part for being pulled into the story so immediately. and i love that you said “reassuring” !! you’re right, it really does feel like a hug !! and in that, it sort of cemented for me how much more i’d always gravitate towards stories that feel… kind? to its characters and its story. i think i’d always be more impressed by this kind of storytelling than any other approach. but that’s a tangent waiting to happen. <br><br>and right! i remember quoting blp in that cc and thinking a gentle little nudge for you to check it out, but also not wanting to force it on you. so i really am super, super glad to know you’ve found something in it for yourself, and i hope you continue / have continued to have a good time with it. <br><br>wishing you all the best in return 💙</div>

 <div class=reply>just bakuten &amp; oddtaxi, and catching up with diaace in spurts! i was roped into oddtaxi thinking it was going to be a completely different show that it ended up being, and i’m honestly pleasantly surprised by how good i find its character weaving and how much… urban-ness? is in the narrative? it’s a fun time. there’s one more episode to go for me to have a complete review of it, but i’ve really enjoyed it. and bakuten became my comfort show of the season overnight so it’s just been a lot of watching and rewatching that. it’s by no means a feat of perfect storytelling, but everything about it—the visuals, the music, the characters, all despite being half the length of most sports animes—has made it such an unexpected but welcome gem.</div>

 <div class=question>hello! ive noticed ur twt acc is gone and i just hope all is well with you and with wherever u are! please stay safe! &lt;3 ok ummm sighs...im starting off by simply saying that this is me trying to voice everything ive felt while reading flls and everything i would like to talk abt through sending u a song that reminds me a LOT of the fic. so! yeah, here i am....its been a couple of weeks since i finished reading it and i guess it says a lot that every song i listen to lately i quickly look up its lyrics and try to make it abt flls itafushi.... but honestly if i had the power of turning back time i would solely use it to be able to read it for the first time again and again and again. i cant thank u enough, from the bottom of my heart, for writing smth so beautiful, so moving, so heartwarming/heart-wrenching/heart-swelling(?), so life changing. it was the first itafushi fic ive ever read and if we r being honest rn not only all itafushi works but ANY work will have a really, really hard time holding up to it (to half quote yuuji ihihi). i wish i could talk more abt ur fic but i guess the more u like smth the harder it is to explain ur feelings towards it? idk? maybe thats just an excuse im using not to keep talking bc i know i wont ever be capable of voice everything flls brings out in me? i guess we will never know! anyways im so grateful for u and ur writing and i cant wait to dive into ur other works! stay safe &amp; i hope ure well! im sending u love love love!<br><br>(the song is posing for cars by japanese breakfast btw :D)</div>

 <div class=reply>this cc was so unexpected in the absolute best way possible. i don’t have my finger on it, exactly, but i’ve also been thinking a lot about flls lately and this just. made me feel so, so deeply for it. thank you so much for your kind, kind words; i feel like i give the same spiel to everyone when i say that there’s really very little that gets me as much as hearing that one of my works made this sort of emotional connection with the reader, but i really, truly mean it every time. thank you from the bottom of my heart as well for finding something beautiful in my fic.<br><br>also !! this cc had me finally going to listen to the new japanese breakfast album and ahhh my heart is a tender thing. the last verse in posing for cars, with that guitar and it being the last song on the album and just — i feel tender about the song and i feel tender about flls and i feel tender about you making the association. thank you and i hope you’re staying safe and well ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>DID YOU REALLY! THAT IS SO WONDERFULLY GRATIFYING, I’M SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. and ohhh that’s a great question! my go-to answer is usually chapter 20; everything here — the stillness of the setting, the dialogue, the art, the push-and-pull — makes my heart ring like a tuning fork. it doesn’t necessarily make me emotional (at least not in the way that i’ve choked up over some of the conversations in the series or been made wistful and pensive by others), but it’s just such a small pocket of heart and empathy and the nuances of how we connect to other people as well as our inner selves that i feel like it encapsulates a lot of what i love about blue period.<br><br>on a less sentimental note, i have a soft spot for chapter 29 as well. and chapter 31. though at this point, i think i’m just outing myself re: who my fav non-yatora characters are. i’m also sure i have a lot of favs among the earlier chapters — but my memory of those are a little bit hazier, so i’ll go with these three for now.<br><br>anyway let me say this again bc i really am so excited about it: i’m so thrilled you’re reading blue period and that you’re having fun with it! i hope that continues to be the case, i really do adore this series with all my heart 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>surprised at how easily i decided on an answer for this but yuuri !! and victor, by extension, but in retrospect, writing yuuri was borderline a high i tried to chase for a good chunk of time even after i stopped dabbling in yoi. or maybe not even borderline. maybe it was a high i did take for granted at the time, full stop. there were just all these layers and co-existing contradictions and complicated feelings in yuuri — not to mention that yuri on ice canon literally throws you a free gift in how unreliable a narrator yuuri is. you don’t even have to grovel or beg for stuff to play with! or construct a specific characterization in this equally specific au just for an excuse to explore a specific facet of this specific character! canon just gives it to you, over and over, from the first episode to the last arc! my mind was so quiet writing yoi bc it was all there, and yuuri at the centre of it all! it’s wild! it’s great! i miss it!</div>

 <div class=reply>this is so beautifully articulated that i’m clenching my fists !!! like? ‘made me feel loved’? ‘inexplicably happy’? ‘want to give and love more’? god? i’m feeling all sorts of warm about how you responded to flls, so thank you, thank you, thank you for reading, for feeling, and for sending this lovely message. i’m so 😳 right now, it’s unreal<br><br>also, filipino is my first language! i always think that i write in english very blatantly like it’s a second language i only picked up earnestly in my teens — in terms of sentence structure and all that jazz — so it’s really intriguing to me that you bring it up bc i do think i would write differently if my relationship with english was just a little bit different, too. but anyway. i’m really happy to hear you call it intricately enchanting, that is so kind. <br><br>all my love right back to you and i hope you’re taking care 💗</div>

 <div class=question>It’s okay!! Please don’t apologize for not answering right away. I completely understand. And yeah. All this practice and just seems to go out the window, because, at the end of the day, I just have to hope that I’ve subconsciously developed enough skills throughout the year… Also, King Lear? Yeah, that was just so annoying to sit through lmao. <br>honestly, reading your response made me tear up. The validation was nice, especially considering that I’m an entire stranger and you only have these words as an insight. You’re really kind, you know that, right? I hope you do. But thank you. I’ve known this for a long time, but I attach my self-worth to my grades too easily, and it’s probably a byproduct of the school system and the pressures surrounding academics. Y’know—the unfortunate usual. I’m working towards being kinder to myself in that context, and as you said, my intelligence isn’t, and shouldn’t be, marked by something as stupid as the college board. And school in general. It’s just a hard process because I am too familiar with being high-achieving even though I can physically see how it drains more out of me each year. Anyways, this is a whole different spiel omg, but as to making lit class more accessible? Absolutely and I wish there was more effort towards that. I did take a modern world lit last year and that was the closest it came to (but even then, the Japanese literature unit was set as the last, and I could tell at the beginning of the class, we’d never get to it due to shortage of time. And I was right lol. The books we read that year consisted of French, German, Russian, other western lit, and Colombian literature. That was nice since my family is from there lol. So, it just felt faux to the name of the class and what it should consist of. And plus, why should a specific class be taken to get a more diverse pool of literature, because I think broadening your intake of media is important for learning. Not just for learning simply about various cultures, but those different perspectives can be applied to anything in your life. And who knows? It may help you find answers and learn how to deal with different struggles for life. Of course, I can do this on my own, and I do, but it can only be to a certain extent because I cannot grasp everything myself. That’s the benefit of class learning. Um. I’m realizing that I can talk a lot lol. At least in writing, too sorry for that whole spiel which is just a reiteration. <br><br>pt 1 of my response bc I apparently write too much (lit student)</div>

 <div class=reply>THAT’S SO INTERESTING my hs didn’t offer anything in the art fields, much less in ap, so thinking about what that’s like is pleasantly intriguing to me ✨ not that i happily did a lot of math and science, either, so hats off to you for braving ap calc. by the time you read this, you’d have been long done the exam — so congratulations ahhh i hope it went well. and by well i mean i hope that you’ve had time &amp; space to take pride in getting through your exams and making it to the end of your senior year. i know i’m feeling a lot of secondhand pride just hearing about it from you 💗<br><br>but i totally understand that “what is the point” feeling. all the more reason to celebrate, i believe! you pushed through and got it all done! i hope you treated yourself to even something as small as an ice cream cone after your last ap exam!<br><br>and hmm i empathize with wanting to be high-achieving. i’d be a hypocrite to say i prioritized wellbeing above academics all the time, especially when i can still be such a perfectionist workaholic despite also being a profoundly lazy person. but i still do wanna say, as an outsider, that working hard isn’t an exclusive thing? sometimes being kind to yourself doesn’t mean studying less, though ofc it can; maybe being kind to yourself means letting yourself have that pricey bowl of your fav food to reward your body for spending late nights working. that kind of thing. let happiness co-exist with hard work as a compromise. but that’s a tangent i spiralled into bc u mentioned being drained! it’s like a — the system’s not gonna change just bc i realize it’s wrong, but that doesn’t mean i have to yield to it to the point of burnout. that kind of thing. <br><br>anyway i’m sorry i lost my train of thought so far that i don’t know where to go back to. but yes! i am nodding along to what you said re diversifying the media you consume. although i think there’s nothing wrong with finding the niche that speaks to you and hanging on stubbornly, either :) as far as learning goes, i’ve always found it frustrating that there will never be enough classes in the world to really do more than scratch the surface of all there is — but again. another tangent. so on that note, please don’t apologize for any spiels. this is a spiels-loving space. <br><br>last thing no omg nothing to thank me for. but i’m glad something landed. you sounded like you had a lot going on – and even more on your mind — in those last ccs, so i keep wanting to reiterate in reply to this one that from my standpoint, you really did a lot, and idk how you’re feeling about all that, but i guess i just want you to know it’s amazing to be doing as much and working as you have been. i’m sending you all my well wishes and warmth ahead of your graduation. if you’re having it in person, then know that in spirit i will be in the crowd cheering when you walk across the stage. hope you’re taking care and that all is well with you 🌷</div>

 <div class=question>Do you think in order to be a "talented" (I'm putting talented in quotations here bc it's a very subjective word but I don't know another word that conveys the same sort of meaning I'm trying to make) writer you have to be super passionate about it? I hear how some talented people talk about their creative passions, whether it be writing, drawing, painting, etc., are as necessary as breathing to them. It seems like a very romantic notion of having your passions consume every part of your life but I'm wondering how realistic that is. I'm trying to get back into writing but I'm worried I'll never get to that same point and therefore won't ever become as talented as these people. Ahh I hope this makes sense. I guess I wanted to ask you this because I think you're a very talented writer and I wanted to know your thoughts on this! I hope you're doing well and that you're having a good day/night &lt;3 --☼</div>

 <div class=question>so i've been following you on n off since bnha and i know this probably sounds weird but it always makes me laugh how quiet your fandom presence is? i remember telling my friend once about how you just come and go into a new fandom drop a life shattering fic with two tags at most then go about your life like nothing happened and we joked about how you leave a fic or fandom alone once you're done with it as if you didn't just give that pairing their real classics. and last week i notice you don't even rt or pin the tweets for your fics. it's just so Chill. i guess what i wanna tell you is that i hope you know you're allowed to talk about your work more. i'm probably crossing boundaries in saying this but you're just still so underrated even with all the love you deservingly receive and i hope you know how much your fics mean to so many people :) &lt;3</div>

 <div class=reply>is it? do i? this is so very nice and so many parts of me are feeling so tickled &amp; validated but also all of this is probably just a reflection of how i’m just. really scared of a) being Too online, and b) giving in to any kind of conceit. which tends to include talking too at length about myself / my work / my thoughts about anything when unprompted 😅<br><br>(when i Am prompted, though, i do think i ramble a lot. like now. which feels, case in point, conceited.) (that still doesn’t take away how i get very icky around the idea of being perceived, or attracting attention i don’t deserve, bc i always feel like i’m bound to disappoint, one way or another, whether with who i am or with my work — which. whatever. separate weirdly vulnerable discussion.) <br><br>all sombre truths aside, thank you for holding my fics on such kind esteem! i feel gratified that my presence comes across as chill and laidback, bc i really do just wanna cruise in and out and drop whatever fics i find in me to write, regardless of everything that comes after externally. we like chill. we want to stay laidback, always. thank you for being so generous to my indulgent little fics + i feel rather seen with this bit of psychoanalysis — so. yeah. thank you, thank you. i am trying my best to be better at the talking about my work thing. i hope you’re doing well. take care.</div>

 <div class=question>yeah hopefully itll be fine!! and sha Ohh OHHH I :( i hope it was a good birthday or at least u didnt feel disappointed at the end of the day :( i spent my 16th in school and worrying abt debate camp .. like it wasnt too bad but. yk. birthdays r meant 2 be special. <br><br>omg ive never taken polaroids of the sea but that makes me want to thats gorgeous 😭 hm i like 'like that' by jp saxe - the lyrics are cool i like songs that have a sort of personality to them. it reminds me of fucked up by young rising sons which is genuinely so good and funny. and sha SHA omg the entire album ashlyn by ashe is so gorgeous. i love it so SO much - taylor is a personal fav, but the others r also SOO good. i have no words. definitely listen to the entire album in a single go. <br><br>OOOH whenever im idk analysing anything i always fixate on minute stuff so what u said is SO true and like,, idk cumulatively so?. i dont know if thats the most accurate word but whatever u hit the nail on the head 😭 "human way of thinking abt art" YES YES and hes just sharing not trying to teach a lesson consciously past some faint shadow of live ur life fully or smth and i LOVE that. agreed w what u said also.<br><br> i think its cool how theres an element of chance to whatever happens in the story and like. on one hand it could be a plot propeller or whatever but i still think its cool how precarious yatoras position always is. like he barely scrapes through a lot of stuff and even when he gets what he wants its never idealistic and there are ALWAYS problems with it. like - surprisingly enough, i dont think his story is really unrealistic like someone Could do that and yatora isnt shown to be a prodigy and thats taken into account. its just very,, real. <br><br>please do!!! omg!! thats a little :( &amp; im patting you pensively but itd be good to get the words out!! and who knows life is. like…, we cant change the past but the future is wack ass shit bro its wild as hell &amp; you cant tell what'll happen so chin up live life as it comes @ u!! and scream yeah i dont think last year wouldve been very conducive towards a healthy relationship 😭 but whatever.<br><br>i know ur busy btw take ur time answering these ❤ i have no idea what ur busy with but congrats if its good!! u've worked so very very hard i hope people r appreciating it!!! slaps a gold sticker on ur cheek. UMM UM do u remember the letters i was telling abt u literally like idk the second cc i sent,,, ive procrastinated working on them forever but i finally finished my crush's and its. 6 pages. also i told her abt u know what. i wrote it at the end 😰 i'm still not sure if i'll end up regretting it but i dont think ill take it back so 😭👍 fingers CROSSED i guess. it's been such a long week i wish i couldve replied sooner but i took a spontaneous trip with my cousins family to my grandparents and it's been an Experience!! i'm so so glad u liked my piece ur reply was so sweet,, u deserve only good things i SWEAR.

 <div class=reply>no no it was fine! i have never really been a big birthday person in terms of celebrating myself so in some part i was relieved that it came &amp; went as it did. but thank you :( and omg debate camp??? also, even more importantly, when was / is your birthday? if you’re comfortable sharing!<br><br>i haven’t listened to the jp saze and young rising sons songs yet but i did sit with ashlyn by ashe in one go like you suggested and ahhhh the vibes are such a soft… yellow and blue? like the colours in blue hour. i totally see why taylor would be your personal fav! i loved the vocal layers in when i’m older, too — though i think always is my favourite? i love how it starts so slow and sparse and just keeps building emotionally. it feels like a musical eleven o’clock number, or like a mid-act 2 ballad — plus those strings at the end? definitely some floating action for me there<br><br>yeah! blue period is just so nicely nuanced about one’s relationship with art. i think what really struck me about it (esp relative to other forms of media i’m consuming at the same time) is how much love is placed at its centre. and not just in an if you love it, it will be fine way — there’s that scene where yatora’s thinking that just bc he loves art doesn’t mean it’s not hard. that there won’t be days that he’s breaking his back over it and regretting choices he made. which is just. yeah. i’m answering another cc about art &amp; talent &amp; passion and it’s made me realize how important it is to be friends with your art. and to approach it not with unconditionality but with layers, for yourself and the quality of the work you put out, too. idk. <br><br>and omg yeah yatora can never rest, and i love that almost always he figures something out bc of an interaction with another character, whether barging into mori’s atelier in uni or literally going fishing with murai. no matter how centric the story is on him, all these other characters are also so invaluable. and i just. have so much fondness. bc they’re all figuring it out and their art becomes what they are bc of the connections they have made or are making. it’s just so. all connected. <br><br>god i know last year was difficult enough on existing relationships, imagine starting a new one. but anyway on a broader sense this past week has been so wild and busy and i really need to write even a journal entry at some point 😔 <br><br>hehe thank you so much for the gold sticker! i am very happy with the gold sticker — HOLD ON. you’re telling her you know what at the end of the letter? omg wait i’m so 🥺 fingers crossed, truly, that is so special :( and omg never a rush when replying to these! i’m glad you were able to go on a trip! how was it! what did you do! i want to live vicariously through your trip bc my province is on yet another lockdown! and oh no no you’re so kind to me all the time i am. shattered. in a good way. you take care as well and stay cool both idiomatically &amp; literally ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>hello. it’s the ap lit student. so I just completed my exam and all I can say is that I don’t think I’ve spouted so much bs in two hours.

 <div class=reply>hope it’s okay that i’m answering all your ccs in one message !! i meant to reply at least before your exam but life got in the way and i am very, very clearly too late for that so — let me start by saying congratulations on finishing your ap lit exam! i can vividly imagine how those two hrs might have felt like, and while it’s been a few years since i had mine, i totally get the feeling of just sitting there &amp; writing and writing. it’s funny bc so much ~preparation ostensibly goes into ap exams, but then you get there and sit for two hrs and just hope for the best. or at least that was my experience 🤨<br><br>but no omg please don’t feel embarrassed about your messages. i was actually looking forward to your reply bc i recently bumped into someone who was my in ap lit class senior year and we were both like… damn… what was that class. but like. with a dash of nostalgia. that said, thank you for sharing your feelings about the class! and i’m sorry that it had its low moments. i felt a lot of the same way with my class as you did. i was super fond of my teacher, and i vibed with a lot of his. thematic choices, i guess. but i was also a very quiet student and kinda just. hung back. pre-ap classes were definitely more fun for me than senior year in terms of the stuff we read? i usually love shakespeare, but we did king lear that year and god. very few highlights for me. same with jane eyre. the rest of the books to write about, i luckily got to choose — but still. i did well on the class and the exam, but doing well academically is also like. more representative of other things to me than of anything involved with the actual literature-absorbing, you know? <br><br>that said, you feeling “dumb” (you are absolutely not, and it’s amazing to me how much effort you put into enjoying this class) or like an imposter in a class shouldn’t be on you, and it’s certainly not a marker of anything but the college board, if not the school system. you’re completely right in wishing you ventured beyond western literature, or at least beyond the “classics” (madame bovary did slap, though, i agree, and so did a bunch of books i read in high school english). i don’t see the point in teaching lit without making it accessible, or at least making an effort to contextualize what made it so good in its time and why that good-ness has endured over time. i know how great a lot of that stuff can be when you feel connected to it — so it’s frustrating and sad to me that so much of that relationship is informed by high school classes. but anyway. <br><br>again, congratulations &amp; i am so proud of you for getting through ap lit! are you doing / did you do any other ap exams? again, no pressure to answer, i’m horrible at replying — but i’m wishing you all the best as you finish up senior year (you’re almost there! 🎉) and hope that you’ll get the rest you deserve soon 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>honestly i started calling flls my favourite child early on in the writing process &amp; at some point it stopped being lighthearted &amp; became a lot more 💀 serious than i ever would have thought when i started. whenever i feel like writing these days, i’ll open up a note on my google keep and write a few lines about that world, just to get the itch out, and that’s not really something i’ve felt with any of my other fics? i think flls is the first fic of mine where i felt wholly ✨ plugged in ✨ to how much i loved writing + it’s the only one where my need to be critical and deprecating of my work comes second to how fond i was writing it — but. my point is. i’d say flls is pretty uncontested as my fav fic of mine at the moment.<br><br>as for fav characters though i remember bakugou in 2 am being really, really interesting in terms of approach! writing introspection with him in that specific fic felt very exciting at the time — and i have conflicting feelings about all my old work now, especially the bnha ones, but i still have a soft spot for 2 am &amp; all the bakugou dynamics that past me crammed into it. also, writing yuuri from victor’s perspective in ltmmly was all kinds of fun. probably my fav love interest in all my current fics 😔</div>

 <div class=reply>hello hello and i hope you are having a wonderful day as well! thank you so much for reading flls and saying such lovely things about it !! and ahhh i really don’t know. i have a few things started for them so it’s definitely not a never, but those wips are also not concrete enough for me to say i have full-on plans to publish a stsg fllsverse thing, either. but thank you for asking after it, and for what it’s worth, writing an flls prequel / companion piece is always on my mind 😊<br><br>(and please don’t apologize oh my god, no errors at all, this is so well-articulated &amp; thoughtful)</div>

 <div class=reply>i don’t mind at all! it’s a bit of a hodgepodge of things, but yeah, i do currently work full-time between two jobs. i guess both are under the independent journalism / independent media category; to give you the cover letter spiel, i work primarily on the literary side within diasporic communities here in canada &amp; any other social justice circles and issues that are adjacent to that etc etc but no yeah basically i’m an editor for one publication (overseeing articles etc etc it’s every bit the deadline-driven, behind-the-scenes cliche of any magazine editor) &amp; an audio producer (radio, audiobooks, podcasts, audio documentaries) for another 🕺🏼</div>

 <div class=question>how does your writing process look like? how long does it typically take for you to finish a piece?</div>

 <div class=reply>i wanna say i don’t really have a process, because every fic starts with a “sit down in front of a doc / pop open a note / grab a piece of paper to scribble on and just write until you run out” moment &amp; i figure out the rest of what it becomes in much the same way. but that chaotic, messy trial-and-error kinda IS the process? i’m as disorganized &amp; open-ended a ~writer as i am a cook &amp; a traveler, and i’m not very fond of using itineraries or recipes or outlines. i don’t often know a single thing before i start, &amp; whatever process there is mostly lies in a lot of head-scratching and interrogating what i end up writing, scrapping what’s not working, then redoing the same ramble-writing all over again until eventually i have a first draft i feel like i can work with in terms of editing, or in terms of moving the story forward. i like writing to be a bit more intuitive, in the sense that it’s more fun for me to figure it out as i go along than to have a plan at all. there’s a thrill in the “what’s gonna happen next? who knows? not me!” feeling.<br><br>that said, the general pattern looks like: i consume a thing. a theme / character / one piece of dialogue sticks with me, or maybe i entertain one interaction between two characters for the fun of it. sometimes it’s “megumi &amp; nobara dealing with grief over yuuji together” &amp; other times it’s “bakugou with glasses.” if i’m impressionable enough to it, or in the mood to indulge, that thought becomes a small little note in my google keep just for me to get it out of my system. but then that little note continues to haunt, &amp; i get the itch to write more of it. then i write more, and more, bc i write 80% of the things that occur to me without a single critical thought, and eventually some of those mores will be deleted, while the rest will become the final product. it’s a process that actually gets easier the farther i go along a story, like working on a puzzle without knowing what it’s supposed to look like. i start with vague things that i feel should go together, but as i do more of that, i’m left with a gradually-finished picture that makes the remaining pieces easier to put together. <br><br>and hmm i’m not as “fast” a writer as i used to be, i think, but i still do get possessed enough to write a fair bit during one sitting. what i’d consider a full piece runs anywhere between 10k to 100k so it does depend on that how long it’ll take me, but my usual habit is slotting out a day or two to write a first version of a fic / chapter that’s around 20k. but i do wanna say — bc i feel vain typing out this response — that i don’t think word count is a fair metric in writing, just that my writing style is very much on the wordy, introspective side and that leads to a higher wc by nature, not necessarily by measure of quality.</div>

 <div class=reply>it’s been a whole week and i’m still so unbelievably stunned about your art, zi. i’ve been sitting on it for these past couple of days and trying to find the words to describe how it made and still does and likely always will make me feel but it’s just — i just love it so dearly and cannot thank you enough. it was so unexpected, too, and it was just such a lovely surprise and i am. astonished. truly astonished. thank you so much for it, and for this, for your words, god i’m literally reading this response out to myself as i type it and i’m stumbling over the words because none of it is enough and my brain keeps short-circuiting between the depth of my gratitude and what i want to be saying. my inbox welcomes you every single time, and i’m so happy to have you here, and i’m just so incredibly tender-hearted about all this, it’s unbelievable. i hope you’re doing as well as can be. thank you for being so ridiculously lovely ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>osmosis is a good word for it! i truly wasn’t expecting to check out more than three eps at most, but i felt such immediate fondness for yuuji about three minutes in and was so pleasantly surprised as well dksjks also i guess i never realized how good it feels to have such attachment to the main character until this point? which is such an oversimplification of all my love for yuuji but yes — very much vibing with this response 😔</div>

 <div class=reply>“and be reminded that there is life outside of it” i’m gonna. go for a lap around the house after this. that’s so wonderfully put, thank you so much for your kind words. you raise such beautiful sentiments here — and i feel very excited knowing flls reached you to a point where you’d want to write, too. <br><br>and whoa, i’ve never really thought in detail about what would be in the package, but i imagine a lot of snacks and tea and maybe a brief letter. and then another package of much the same will come in a couple more months until yuuji’s finally like, “so, when can i visit?”</div>

 <div class=reply>definitely not as extreme as it used to be but yes. of course. there was a point when i was younger where it made me near nauseous to know that i am never going to compare. but i kinda want to interrogate that. where is the certainty coming from? and more importantly, what are we even talking about when we say compare? <br><br>bc one thing i’ve found, or at least tried to make peace with over the years, is that one good work can never compare to another. and sometimes i think that if smth is only good relative to another thing, then maybe it can’t be that strong in the first place. sure, we can compare one artist’s new album or book or painting to one they’ve created before, we can say that oh their old stuff isn’t as good, but that makes a lot more sense than comparing a sci-fi author’s work to a contemporary novelist. everyone’s minds work differently, and everyone will approach the exact same story differently, &amp; i think that renders comparison, or the idea of being ~as good as another writer, a total moot point. <br><br>but insecurity is an appropriate word, because the problem is a lack of security coming from not knowing your strengths. maybe you’re not sure what’s setting your work apart from what other people on your level are capable of doing. no matter how good, they won’t be able to write the exact same story you can. and no matter what you think, you do have strengths. find them and lean hard into them. learn what your weaknesses are, too, and learn to improve on them. and that collection of strengths &amp; weaknesses will never be the same collection that another person has, no matter how ~talented you might think they are. <br><br>i do feel insecure about my writing. i don’t often love my work. i know it can be better. i read smth and i’m like, man, i’ll never be able to make my mind work like that. and that feeling sucks, but what time and just writing &amp; writing has allowed me to do is realize that in the grand scheme of things, it might matter a lot less than what my brain is telling me it does. i don’t care what writing teachers say; i don’t think there’s one universal good way of writing. and i don’t think one good author’s work can ever be the be-all and end-all of what great writing should look like. there’s a lot more harm than good in trying to be As Good or even Better than one other person’s writing. i think that, if you must compare, compare with yourself. do the work in your own growth, and let time and intuition do its own job. fake it til you make it if you must. and when u admire someone so much it makes u sick, see it as an opportunity for learning. then keep focusing on yourself. the goal isn’t for the shitty feeling to go away forever, bc idk if it will, but to find a secure place above or beyond it.<br><br>but i also know this is all easier said than done. that it’s hard being stuck in that cycle of comparison. thank you for your q and i’m sorry that i don’t have a better answer.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh good god Everything is happening. please take care and stay safe. and i hope things are still okay with your sister coming home? and zi :( thank you :( it’s the 8th here and i’m spending it swamped with work but there’s something oddly fitting about it. took a social distanced walk with a friend yesterday, too, and that was really nice. but anyway. <br><br>i love polaroids of the sea! the blue always turns a little pink when captured, and it looks like cotton candy. ALSO PLEASE THAT MUSIC VIDEO WAS A WHOLE COMING OF AGE MOVIE, I WAS SO ASTONISHED. i loved the colours, the ✨ cinnamon topography ✨ the 🌸 vibes 🌸 and jeez, i know, everyone has come out or are coming out with an ep / a new song and my release radar is struggling to keep up. do you have any new favourites? <br><br>and hmm !! i love your highlighting of the delineation between message and medium as two connected but separate parts of a piece. i think what blp does really well, too, is find that balance between technique and heart, which is something yatora’s shown to continue to struggle navigating. i really appreciate that blp places meaning on the work that goes into the art being able to stand and — like you said — speak for itself, bc it’s like, if you put yourself into what you make, it will show? which is at once a very romantic and perhaps idealistic take on it, but if anything, the genuine-ness really comes from this understanding that technique is a good foundation, but ultimately how it reaches another person is what makes the work what it is. it’s just. such a human way of thinking of art. very flawed and very beautiful in how art is whatever it is to you. whether it has any “meaning” at all or not. like. blp establishes early on that if it’s blue to you, it’s blue. and that just. shatters any corporate attempt to make art insular or exclusive. which. yeah. i got emotional and forgot my point. <br><br>PLEASE. and yeah, it really isn’t the kind of thing where i have any way of contacting her anymore. but no, you’re right, i should write a letter. or at least a journal entry. it’s been haunting me more these days bc it’s coming up to a full year since it happened djsjsks AND NO SERIOUSLY I WAS VERY TOUCHED PEOPLE WOULD FEEL ANYTHING TOWARDS ME AT ALL but i was also trying to hold onto sanity in lockdown. and still reeling from my disastrous rejection. <br><br>OH MY GODKDDSKJJS THAT IS THE POINT, FATHER. but yesssss yes yes pressed flowers that makes me 🌷☀️🌸✨ i’m saluting you in your little clown car. we love clown cars. ALL THE LOVE AND WELL WISHES TO YOU, DRIVE SAFE WITH YOUR LITTLE CLOWN NOSE ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>im only just now learning to be more conscious of my writing and the whys &amp; hows of it, so i'm maybe not the most equipped to give advice. but. okay. this is a very broad question. what abt writing do you want to ~improve? <br><br>is it flow? sentence/word-level stuff? then i would say maybe read more, but specifically read someone whose words sound like music inside your head. if you’re not quite sure what i mean — and this is maybe bad to endorse, i’m sorry — pay attention to how the words sound while being read in your mind, their semantic meaning be damned. don’t worry about what the words mean for now, just let them flow. get to know your inner narrator. if you have to, read it out loud. and just like a good song, pay attention to what parts you find catchy. melodic. <br><br>poetry is also very useful for this! here’s an example from ari banias: "he looks at you with such tenderness, and nesting in the tenderness, with a small clicking sound like a minute hand or teeth, a desire to devour you."<br><br>i love all the commas! pauses mean space to breathe! very simple words here, but u can feel the softness in "looks," the helpless emphasis in "such," the impact of repeating tenderness in the second clause, the simplicity and effectiveness of the metaphors. and the bulk of the work here is being done by punctuation, connotation, repetition. which are things that are naturally ingrained, or at least become intuitive, i think, once you learn how to translate the voice in your head into the page and, in doing so, what other people’s inner narrators hear when they read your work.<br><br>or is it characterization u want to improve? this is prob a bit questionable, but a good rule of thumb i found has worked for me when i’m writing non-fic is to start with their enneagram personality type. which is to say, start with a basic desire and a basic fear and go both ways from there. how does it inform their decisions &amp; their thoughts, yes, but also, why did they turn out that way? <br><br>overall, i have no authority to be dishing out this stuff, but i think these are the two elements that make a story enjoyable for me. good, plausible characters treated with empathy in their characterization, and line-level writing that’s so natural and flowy that it doesn’t call harsh attention to itself. it just is. <br><br>with that in mind, i think i’ve yet to find a novel that’s truly had both for me. it’s always one more than the other. but a good middle ground for me are any kind of creative nonfiction; there’s no flow quite like someone trying to articulate their thoughts first and foremost to themselves, and i think there’s a lot to learn from that vulnerability in how we treat our fiction. which is to say i’m blanking on fav books as usual but also, i'm reading pop song by larissa pham and i’m really enjoying its voice so far. <br><br>i’m sorry i can’t provide a stronger answer; i’m also figuring things out myself. but know that i am very much cheering you on 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i was so stumped by this q when i first got it bc i’m going to be real with you — my initial answer was that i don’t know. i do have to acknowledge that jjk is definitely not one of those things i would have gotten into, i think, if i didn’t discover it in the particular time i did? it’s just not the kind of series i usually gravitate towards, and not the kind of storytelling i like to be surrounded by (on both a layered and a superficial level), but i just really, really needed something to love at the time and jjk was there. and i knew i was sucked in the moment i got the urge to write for it about two arcs in. but at the same time, i’m like, “hm, that’s not the same as me actually loving it for what it is, though, is it?” <br><br>then i thought about it some more and you know what? it’s yuuji. yuuji is everything i love about jjk. himself, his layers, his dynamics with everyone around him. that’s the heart of my love for jjk. it’s not too deep, either. he just brings me a lot of serotonin, and i think at the end of the day, while jjk has loosened its hold on me in the meantime, he’ll always be that one thing tying me to the series and keeping me here. <br><br>but on a broader level — i talked about this a lot with some irls when jjk first came out — what drew me to it before anything else was that it felt very nostalgic and new at the same time? there’s a sense of… it feels like a tribute or homage to older shounen anime i loved as a kid, but with an undeniably contemporary flavour to it? so it feels at once familiar and lovable while also being fresh enough that it seemed like a no-brainer to get into it. if that makes sense. <br><br>and ahhh i’m not and never really have been one for predictions and theories, especially post the akutami interview chaos. something kinda just shifted in my relationship with jjk after that — but that’s a different discussion altogether. and i think the path i would take the story myself, for whatever purposes, goes against everything jjk is or has proven itself to be. but i am still looking forward to where this arc is going to go! i’m strapped in for the ride, though i am at the same time fatigued and kinda just taking it at a more leisurely pace than i have been in the past several months. <br><br>but i guess, to provide a blanket answer to your qs: i am equal parts tired and intrigued about where this arc will head and how complications post-shibuya will continue to unfold etc etc and i am here bc i will risk it all for yuuji ✌🏼</div>

 <div class=reply>oh man it’s honestly closer to arbitrary than not? sometimes i keep the vague title i had on the wip doc, which is usually just one little tagline / quote / lyric i put there to serve as a reminder of where i’d maybe want to take the fic, but if that existing title doesn’t really fit / doesn’t really look like i want it to in ao3 formatting / doesn’t really have the same vibes as the story, then i replace it with the title of whatever song i’m listening to at the moment of posting. which is. really not very deep or well thought out 😅</div>

 <div class=question>blue period anon - im glad my previous ask elevated a bit of the burden you had on you, things get so messy and chaotic a lot of the time and i hope you take some time out for yourself everyday (or if not, every few days) and think about yourself &lt;3<br>also this is incredibly random and out of nowhere but, when i read about the "blue of shibuya at dawn" it immediately reminded me of a day back when i was 16 and fell asleep in the bus on the way to school, and woke up in the middle of the journey to the sun rising at around 6:45 and the entire city was drenched in pinks and yellows, i never saw that sunrise again but when yaguchi said that something old rose up in me, nostalgia maybe but i would place it as more of a feeling of longing, aside from my long winded rambling, do you have anything from blue period which you've experienced in your own life, something small that hit you?<br>oh and the part about your wips - i absolutely adore your ideas, im a huge space-scifi fan and love reading anything from novels to nonfiction to fanfiction (and other mediums ofc) about them so that seems pretty exciting!! and the stsg flls au seems like it'd be a really delightful (albeit painful) exploration of them - i love how you characterized them both in flls and if you ever write them anew and apart i would love to read it. about the celebrity au, don't be afraid to try out things you've done before!! though as someone who writes somewhat somebit, i do get the feeling of being repetitive but write it for your own indulgence if you want to :')) your attachment to flls is so sincere i love when you talk about it, it might feel redundant to you but from my experience if you explore outside of it (such as celeb au, island au and space au) it gets easier to look at what you previously created from a fresh and new perspective, take care 🌼</div>

 <div class=reply>ahhh you really are too kind, thank you so much. i hope you are applying the same care &amp; kindness to yourself, and i’m wishing you all the best. <br><br>and gosh, that sounds beautiful. i didn’t realize how much i miss commuting in early morning until now — there’s something irreplaceable about the liminality of that specific kind of sunrise. that specific kind of early morning, really, and i empathize with the feeling of longing you highlight here. and no, please, it’s hardly long winded rambling, i really appreciate it! as for your question, it’s not really something i’ve experienced in my own life, but something small that hit me so much harder than i think it was meant to was mori saying that, for her, every drawing is a prayer. and i know it’s more literal in her case, but i’ve been thinking a lot since about writing, too, as a form of prayer, and of prayer as a form of love shared, love projected, love expressed, and of writing, by extension of all this, as a form of healing. of well wishes. kinda like — “through this, i want to see you heal. i want to see you love. i want to see you take care of yourself and love what you do.” which is something i really appreciate about mori &amp; yatora’s dynamic. but i don’t know. there’s a whole bunch because blue period zooms through so many good bits that i definitely need a proper reread for, though this one has been the most present. <br><br>and goodness, thank you so much for being so considerate and validating about my wips. i do think there’s that element of — fic is a rare kind of playground? i get to be indulgent about the strangest things, so there’s this sense of having to take advantage of the room i’m given to try new things i wouldn’t have the luxury of attempting otherwise. like with flls, with was just me pollock-ing a bunch of colors until they made a somewhat complete image to me. so i think that’s my worry with being repetitive — that i’m not taking enough advantage of the space i have here to be a bit more careless. but anyway. didn’t mean to dump this on you. thank you so much for your lovely ccs &amp; i hope you are taking care as well ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>THIS SONG… IS SOMETHING ELSE. i haven’t heard it before this &amp; listening to it with headphones was Such an experience — like, the mixing? and the strings? the layered (?) vocals during that series of “take me with you”? i transcended this plane of existence for a bit there. didn’t help at all when i started thinking hard about megumi &amp; yuuji during “we can run / forget ourselves / leave them behind” <br><br>but yes, same! i’ve been fairly chill with jjk in the recent chapters as we set up this arc, and i have wondered what their dynamic is going to look like from here on out. i appreciate seeing yuuji more like ~himself after being reunited with megumi, but post-shibuya is so harsh on them both and i can’t see their dynamic Not having its moments towards whatever change as this current arc progresses — and yeah. i don’t know. i’m just going with the flow at this point, even if the flow is more like. a whirlpool. <br><br>thank you for this song rec, it’s been on repeat the past several days 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>hi :3 i hope things have been looking up for you recently, and if they aren't i hope they do soon 💕 just wanted to drop by and say a few things - one i recently finished binging through blue period and sat with it for a day or two thinking about how every feeling i had was so similar to when i had read flls - it isn't the writing style but more so how both stories depict emotions that understand you and strip you down to a vulnerable position (and that's a really really tender feeling for me, to know myself through reading something and letting it make me feel vulnerable is comforting rather than scary) and yeah, just wanted to say that (there are other books (banana heart summer, goodbye tsugumi and haikyuu), films (house of hummingbird and hirokazu koreedas films) and music (galileo galilei) which have made me feel this way and im adding flls to that list now too - just wanted to tell you that, it feels so nice) - - - [also if you don't mind telling, which wips have you been working on :o i'd love to know that] take care 🌼</div>

 <div class=reply>this cc right here got me choked up in the middle of the night so just — okay. first off, thank you. things are unbelievably hectic, but this took some of the tension out of my shoulders, so really, thank you so much. second, i’m so happy to hear you binged blue period! i totally feel you on sitting with it for a day or two; it’s been such a pleasant surprise to me this year, even as i took my time catching up with it. <br><br>third — god, i’m on the verge of silent-screaming — i can’t even pretend to be calm about you comparing flls to blue period and all these other forms of media that mean a lot to me as well. it really puts it into perspective, and a really stark one at that, kind of just recalibrating the way my brain wants to think of flls… and i’m nothing short of stunned. thank you. you’re so wonderfully lovely for saying all this. <br><br>and ahh thank you for asking after the wips as well but i’m afraid they’re quite small? i wanted to attempt a different genre this year, so i have a space/maybe time travel itafushi au that i’m a bit terrified of but want to write so badly for the ~experience. there’s an entertainment world au that i know i shouldn’t pursue bc i’ve done that already for yoi and some of the themes might be repetitive — except it’s also very close to flls in spirit and i think a part of me is subconsciously holding onto something i know. i’ve also been haunted by a stsg flls-verse au, though that is admittedly at the bottom of the priority list bc a substantial part of me knows, again, that i should leave that universe alone. and now i’m thinking that i haven’t written a small town/small island fic for jjk yet and how tackling second loves would be cool? but i don’t know! flls was such a monster that it covered a lot of stuff i would have otherwise taken two or three fics to want to adapt from canon and/or general themes i wanna write about so now i’m left without much to play with and it’s sucking me dry 🤨 <br><br>BUT ANYWAY IM JUST THINKING OUT LOUD MY MAIN POINT IS YOU REALLY GOT TO THE CORE OF MY HEART WITH THIS ONE I CAN’T THANK YOU ENOUGH PLEASE STAY SAFE AND TAKE CARE</div>

 <div class=reply>this is going to sound silly in terms of code but all it is was enclosing the parts i needed to be smaller within &lt;small&gt; and &lt;/small&gt;. so, for example, if i want “hello, i like pancakes” in smaller font, it would look like:<br><br>&lt;small&gt;hello, i like pancakes&lt;/small&gt;</div>

 <div class=reply>i really like how musical-esque it is! and the shift of the singing throughout the verses from quiet and sombre to something almost angry in its sadness? it’s far from my favourite from that album, but i think its ~vibes &amp; emotions are the most specific of the bunch and i appreciate that a lot.</div>

 <div class=question>hi i just finished flls and i just wanted to say thank you for writing such a masterpiece. it reminded me of the first and only time i have every been in love and so many things hit home especially the part about understanding yourself and the other person. this may sound a little selfish but i felt very seen while reading this fic, and at least for me in my experience, it perfectly captured what loving someone is like.</div>

 <div class=reply>okay, wait, first, i’m glad you’re free for the meantime but also — why did they get cancelled? plus oh my god, they’re bleeding into the next school year? and hmm 2-3 week quarantine make sense but ahhhh 😔and i wish we can do a picnic but it’s gotten really strict here in my province right now and cops are getting involved etc etc so we’ll probably settle for a zoom movie night. but thank you :( think they might be livestreaming the cherry blossoms this year so… that’s… something... ? if a little sad. also, my bday is may 8th! but goodness, zi, you don’t have to send me anything, i promise.<br><br>LIZZY MCALPINE DID WHAT. HOLD ON. WAIT I AM ZOOMING TO CHECK THIS. and hmmm you’re only describing it but i am already feeling so much. luz is just hitting like nothing else, even on a conceptual level. and i know this isn’t what you said, but i’ve always loved polaroids of the sea. don’t know why. something about it is just a perfect capture of peace to me. NO I HAVE NOT SEEN THE AUTHOR MUSIC VIDEO WAIT I’LL DO THAT FIRST THING AFTER WOW I AM SO UN-KEPT UP ON EVERYTHING but yes !! sal released a podcast ep on how he made turning page and mentioned atlas iii in it and i swear to god i had to pause. it’s been too long since we got a non-churchy sal song. <br><br>OKAY WAIT I’M GONNA ANSWER YOUR BLP TRAILER CC HERE BECAUSE ME TOO. I LOVE HOW THEY DROPPED IT WITHOUT WARNING IT SLAPPED ME ACROSS THE FACE. and ahhh i love yatora’s conversations with everyone so much, i’m still reeling from each one, i have to reread soon 🤩<br><br>and oh, no… zi… i know i can’t speak for the world, but for what it’s worth, you’re never bothering me, and i highly doubt that the people you speak to feel that way at all. you’re good. you’re so good, and i’m glad your crush alleviated that so sweetly. she’s such a lovely soul :( and i totally understand the warmth of being friends with someone u like. ALSO PLEASE i have friends i’m flirty with, but i don’t think i have crushes often? i’ve technically only been in love once in my life, too. and um. i was so much of a disaster with that one that when she told me she was in love with me, i brushed it off and ran away and now… we aren’t talking… so! i’m sorry this isn’t light-hearted at all but i’m typing this up at 3am and i find it darkly hilarious bc i was a mess. this wasn’t even when i was young. this was last year. i got a bunch of confessions in 2020, but this one was just. chaos. i’m never forgiving myself for it. but it’s okay. i’m not a love and relationships person for myself, even if i do love writing about it. <br><br>god, i don’t want to end this on a sombre note but i’m running out. take care, my dear, and you stay safe as well ☀️</div>

 <div class=question>you mentioned it on your twitter but someone created a tiktok about your first love late spring fic and i think it has like 40K likes rn. I think they misattributed the quote but they did mention how beautiful your writing was (and posted a followup tiktok with your writing, gushing about its beauty -- i related so heavily). idk i just really hope you know how amazing your writing is + guessing by the comments on the tiktok and on curiouscat that are also talking about how powerful your fic was to them, this is definitely not a solitary sentiment but one shared by many. <br><br>you've mentioned several songs and books that have inspired you, but if you had to name your favorite book, movie, and song of all time, what would it be? im so curious as to what types of words and what types of artists inspire you, because i think you yourself inspire so much as well</div>

 <div class=reply>oh no, that’s really nice! i didn’t know. i was really worried because i’ve seen people attribute the quote to flls when it’s not even anywhere in the fic and i definitely do not take credit for it (and last i heard the tik tok has surpassed 100k likes, which is — a lot to process) but having context for the rest of it is so kind and very much welcome. and your words, too; it’s something i’ve been feeling discouraged about with the surge of passing comments on flls from the past couple of days, so thank you for taking the time to say something so nice &amp; contemplative about the fic despite it all ❤️<br><br>and hmm these are really good qs, and you are so sweet for phrasing it the way you did. i don’t know about inspired, necessarily, because the work i want to ✨ create ✨ has certainly changed and shifted over the years in terms of ~thematic points, but i do know that i gravitate towards a particular kind of heartfelt-ness in a thing? so in a way, that’s inspiration for me? when i can feel a creator putting their love into their work, when it makes me think, “yeah, seeing this person love what they do makes me remember why i love what i do” — those are the moments that come close to inspiration for me. so. manga like haikyuu &amp; blue period. movies like little forest &amp; columbus &amp; before sunrise or anything directed by koreeda. soft songs by sleeping at last and josé gonzalez and the oh hellos. like, i’m really bad at keeping track of favourites bc i consume so much and speak so little of whatever love forms until someone talks to me about them / i get to write about it somehow — but it’s more feeling, i think? <br><br>on a technical level, attending an anne carson lecture was the reason i majored in what i did, and while i am more intimate with her work as an academic than as a poet, i love her particular way of retelling and subverting and reshaping centuries-old stories. (plus her translation work is syntax-changing.) in the genre sense, too, i think carmen maria machado is so unparalleled in the contemporary scene. <br><br>i had a conversation with a publisher a couple weeks ago and it sort of clarified for me that what i really look for, at the end of the day, is anything with empathy, and anything that defies easy genre / trope assignment. and i know i have a lot of admiration for creators that can work with multiple mediums. but getting into that would be a tangent 😅<br><br>i’m feeling very soft-hearted after this cc, coming after a tad bit of anxiety from the past couple of days, so thank you so, so much for this.</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you so so much for reading &amp; taking the time to send me this! 🤍<br><br>and ahhhh i struggle quite a bit with making my stories more ~discoverable; i’m definitely terrified of them reaching too far beyond their scope? i’m grateful that people find and read my work despite the lack of ways to find it, but it helps lessen the anxiety of posting something to just exist quietly in the corner of the tag and leave it to be found through whatever methods people stumbled upon it through? but i know you mean very well by wanting the story to be easier to find and i’m thankful! it’s definitely something i’ll consider, and i totally understand where you’re coming from.</div>

 <div class=question>hi i hope u dont mind that i keep sending you asks i am just slowly starting to process ur fic after my 24 hour reread and not just ur fic but the emotions i had with it... and wow. i don't know if this is going to make sense but reading as much as you wrote even in a book becomes a deeply personal experience, but the fact that i read it in 24 hours, and it's fanfiction, and it was before i read the manga is just so.... specfic. like i'm looking around and i'm like... who else had this experience. who else had this deeply personal experience reading a fanfic online... when like... i cannot be in a fandom for a fanfic y'know. like after that i had just had to go and have dinner with my family as if i'm the same person i was before and not carrying around megumi within me after that fic y'know. like i remember having my world rocked and going "how do i reconcile this?" i remember not even telling any of my friends because how do you tell them? how do u possibly explain that? and what do i tell you??? like "i loved it" isn't enough and this is too much. okay sorry jdhfjff that was SO broad let's get more specific. i literally adored nanami from your fic, went oh he's going to be an important character to me, only to read the manga and face the consquences. same with ur tender satosugu. like... your fic is canon to me more than a lot of other people who read it because i read it before the manga, and i read the manga because of your fic and now i'm slowly having to be like.. oh... so that's not actually canon. like... UR TOO GOOD. gosh okay that's it i'm so sorry this was so broad i hope it's clear i adored ur fic. it's the longest fic i've ever read in years, and never in that little time. like it was such a daze and a special experience and like... thank u for doing this shit for free. i will be bothering u forever i think.</div>

 <div class=reply>absolutely! yatora’s dynamic with anyone he breathes around 😇<br><br>this isn’t even an exaggeration. i’m a sucker for a specific kind of dialogue / interaction, and blue period delivers it with everyone from yatora’s group of friends (that ramen scene with koi-chan, god) to his own mother to ooba sensei. he’s had so many conversations that moved me to tears purely bc of how the ebb and flow of the dialogue was handled, even if the content itself is simple or not novel, and i just really, really, Really appreciate that. there’s so much balance and nuance in the relationships, too, and everyone gets their moment to sort of just sit and breathe in those layers. <br><br>like — i love the purity of mori &amp; yatora’s dynamic, how her art was what pulled him in and how it remains sort of a beacon for him. i loved how they drew small prayers for each other before she graduated, and how seeing her painting in his third year helped recenter him when he needed it. <br><br>i am in love with the back-and-forth that yuka-chan and yatora have, how they navigate their fundamental differences and found a kind of vulnerability that works for them in that stunning beach chapter. i love the insight they have into each other — insight that isn’t always right or complete, but insight that is indivorceable from who they are as individuals first and foremost. <br><br>i love the inevitable complicatedness of what yotasuke and yatora feel about each other. the validity of how they respond to each other’s relationship with art. the way that their affection and bitterness existed side by side. the way they trust each other’s work as friends, even if they circle and think and side-glance more than they stand beside each other. <br><br>i love the cram school trio! i love what haruka as a character means for yatora, how he delivers his insights and how they contrast with whatever crisis yatora has going on at the moment. i love that he’s defined by this steadiness i find so compelling, and what that means for yatora. i love that kuwana is the opposite, that she feels all these messy feelings and desires and resentments and guilt and ambition, but that it never gets in the way of her own dynamic with yatora. i love all three of them together, and wish we got to see that more (with yotasuke.) <br><br>but also murai &amp; yatora have me on a chokehold. Pinned Down. buckled to the floor. i’m not sure why yet. part of it is very shallow, i know. but there’s so much meat to bite into there and i’m craving to get more history about murai before i crack and make up one for my purposes.</div>

 <div class=reply>oh wow… recently? or like. ever? i think if it made it to some buzzing circles, chances are i’ve touched it somehow 😅 does that mean i finished it? i prob did not if it’s from recent years. but did i try it? very likely. <br><br>i unearthed my mal acc from high school for this bc i didn’t know how else to answer but — it’s honestly a mess, i’m so sorry. there’s dragon ball, the old shaman king &amp; hxh, mecha like voltes v and zoids and all the gundams possible and aldnoah zero and code geass, one piece to fairy tail to kimetsu no yaiba to bnha to ao no exorcist to mirai nikki, ohshc to bokura ga ita to lovely complex to toradora to shigatsu wa kimi no uso to the old fruits basket to clannad to isshuukan friends. that one year where everything from noragami to death parade to cheer danshi was coming out. if it’s slice of life-adjacent like kimi to boku or tamako market, i’ve had a phase. if it’s something music related like la corda d’oro or nodame cantabile, i’ve also had a phase. if it’s by kyoani, i gave it a shot, from kyoukai no kanata to hyouka. or if it’s by mappa, from banana fish to even dororo. sports anime from major, eyeshield 21, diaace, free, oofuri, kazetsuyo to 3-gatsu no lion and chihayafuru and ping pong. there was also a point in middle school where katekyo hitman reborn was, like, my only personality trait. same with pandora hearts and special a and romeo x juliet. higashi no eden. soul eater. i wrote my grade 12 legal philosophy paper on psycho pass’ world. i sat through kuroshitsuji and gosick. i’ve seen the entirety of bleach. and the first novel i ever tried writing was literally just a shameless knock-off of kyou kara maou. <br><br>at the same time, too, i’m a total blank slate for some big stuff like naruto and jojo. so it’s really just. painfully arbitrary. i consumed literally whatever — indiscriminately — up until the last five years. i don’t think me watching smth back then has any bearing on whether i even critically loved the thing, but i am happy to talk about any anime i’ve seen/any manga i’ve read, may it be cowboy bebop or great teacher onizuka or even something like k-on and lucky star. i just. have a lot less time these days. so loving something has had to come one at a time. like jjk. like blue period. eternally feel-good ones like nozaki-kun and barakamon. or like yuri on ice and mp100 and my annual rewatch of both hq and fma:b. <br><br>yeah. sorry, this is such a long-winded half-answer sjsdks but as for things i’m keeping up with these days, it’s really just jjk and blp! people have also been trying to get me into csm but i am struggling with it big time and ahhhh</div>

 <div class=question>hi, came over from ao3 and your stuff's so good TTvTT ty for sharing your work, it was a delight to read!!<br><br>also read some of your posts on tumblr about writing, and you sound??? so elegant??? dksafjfs idk whats the right word to use but it's like a mix between amazing self introspection with the vibes of a friend chatting about life at 3am in the morning, sitting together in the kitchen as we wait for the cookies to finish baking. oddly specific, but basically I just want to say it's super calming to read about how you manage expectations and all that stuff about how you view your writing!!! honestly it's pretty inspirational :'&gt;<br><br>I was just wondering, do you also have a post about your writing process or how you write such emotion-packed scenes with such finesse? You talked a bit about falling in love with the process of writing, and I'm curious if there's anything specific that writers can do to help achieve that.</div>

 <div class=reply>thank You !! &amp; this description is so painfully nice, i’m happy it comes across that way? i’m just. visualizing this scenario &amp; my heart is clenching in a good way.<br><br>and hmm i don’t have a post about my writing process, exactly, mostly bc the process doesn’t really have a form. i’m not very good at outlining or plotting ahead so a lot of my writing is just sitting down and figuring it out as i go along. i’m trying to write a reflection on how i wrote one of my fics rn but what i’m finding is that if there’s smth abt it to label a process, it’s a very messy one 😅<br><br>but that said, trial-and-error is also concrete enough of a process to learn to understand, and i’m def trying to do that these days! so when i say falling in love with the process of writing, it’s really just falling in love with the steps that lead to the “end product.” the editing, the super rough drafts, the word by word to the sentence by sentence to the paragraph by paragraph. writing isn’t gonna be fun all the time, bc there are parts of it that would be arduous no matter what, and just bc you love it won’t change this. but, for me, it’s like — it’s okay to let it be a slow boil, y’know? i’ve been using the metaphor of a jigsaw puzzle lately when talking about writing, and i think, sometimes, when people get stuck writing a thing, it’s bc they’ve fallen in love with a visual of what the complete puzzle looks like. and they get frustrated with what they’re writing bc it’s not amounting to that ideal. but the way i see it, if you learn to love the process of picking up each puzzle piece and examining its shape and finding a thrill in looking for where it’s supposed to fit, then again for the next one and the next and the next — writing gets a lot more fun, i believe. of course there are people who write better when they do have a visual of what the whole looks like and that is so valid. but, speaking for myself, i think part of my love for writing is bc it’s a process of discovery. what am i gonna find on the other side, when i’m done? i don’t have a clue. and that’s fine. focus on the small things, let yourself discover the rest, that kind of thing. <br><br>but that’s not a very concrete answer, is it? it’s very chaotic. i understand that. so going back to what you said, i think it’s just really about finding what works for you. a lot of writing tips can be so didactic about structure and plot and i’m not a big believer in them as universal rules — so. ignoring all the writing advice out there, including this, pinpoint what you find fun. is it describing a place that you like doing best? is it dialogue? then build your way up from there, etc.<br><br>i’m reaching the word limit and haven’t even gotten to a decent thesis but. yeah. i’m sorry for this organized mess of an answer. and i’ll honestly write a post about any little thing. so. if there’s anything i can ramble about, please let me know 😔✌🏼</div>

 <div class=reply>my diaace phase came and went quietly a long time ago, unfortunately… i have four abandoned wips for it, according to my drive, and i don’t know about ever revisiting them again — but at the same time, it’s always never say never. i know i want to catch up with the anime eventually, and i won’t be surprised if i want to write for it in whatever way i can 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>that’s very, very nice of you to say, thank you so much, but i worry it sounds more so than it prob actually is? it was this self-published thing i wrote among friends, then it got picked up by a publisher, then this and that happened to the company and i ended up deciding to take the rights back. so. idk if that still makes a book a capital b Book when the whole fiasco was the equivalent of like. a teenage fling, a summer hook-up, with the publishing world — but here we are ✌🏼😔 occasionally, i do get a message asking for a copy of any of its versions, which i admit is still super nice.</div>

 <div class=reply>UNTIL JUNE? I KNOW YOU SAID IT ISN’T TOO BAD BUT NO REST UNTIL THEN? OR? and ohhhh it’s so nice to hear your sister’s coming back !! ten months is simultaneously shorter and longer than it sounds so. i imagine it’s nice to get the chance to be ~home for a bit, however she defines that. and it’s very cool to be studying abroad so young, oh my goodness. COFFEE AND WAFFLE DATES ARE THE DREAM RIGHT NOW. it’s technically cherry blossom soon here but it was snowing yesterday and now it’s like -10 degrees so. not quite so summer-y here. but i’m very happy things are looking sunny &amp; bright for u on several ends ✨<br><br>it’s the chord progression on her songs, man. and the depth &amp; richness of her voice. she can set her grocery list to a few minor chords and sing along and i’ll be like wow that… really hits the heart. AND Y E S THE OH NO NO NO NO PART WAS JUST MY FAVOURITE<br><br>i was telling my brother, “damn the person who rec’d blp to me really nailed it.” like ofc there are parts where i need a little bit more but it’s just so warm &amp; heartfelt overall and really what more do you need from a story. the heart of good storytelling is empathy &amp; truth and all that etc etc and yeah there were a few points where yatora’s questions became questions i asked myself and it really is special. and all the identities and histories that find themselves woven into the story even when we remain pretty strictly yatora-centric is so — god. i love everyone so deeply. and ahh my brother’s a big manga person and i’m really not, so when i find one that i have the attention span for bc i’m so immersed, it’s a big enough deal i think. i knew i was gonna love blp but i wasn’t expecting to (clenches fist) love it like this ✨ maybe jjk has starved me too much of this kind of tenderness<br><br>THE DIRECTNESS OF CALLING ME A CLOWN SKSKSJSJ okay in all seriousness, thank you for this. i can’t believe you had to give me a pep talk, i’m so sorry. and no, i know. i don’t believe in the good-ness of my writing, but i do believe in the good-ness of my love for the process of it, and. yeah. figuring out the rest in due time is. what we do. cheers to that. (no but really, this is very kind. i. am struggling. but thank you so much.) <br><br>YOU TOO OH MY GOD. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. I’M THREATENING YOU BACK. and yes !! i was raised by grandparents who only listened to the radio and it just hits the spot like nothing else. maybe that’s why i like radio podcasts. if you ever need smth playing in the bg, there’s smth called “i will not return your records” with a dj called lorrie edmonds. recordings of her hour-long radio show are still available and i just put it on sometimes. idk if you’ll vibe with the songs, but just. dropping it here. sending u all the restful vibes i can summon ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>hi since people r sending you song lyrics and quote and such: i hate living by the hospital / the sirens go all night / i used to joke that if they woke you up / somebody better be dying - halloween by phoebe bridgers reminds me of flls! (can i add that you have created such romantic notions about sleep within me. it's funny to think about, but i really think i'm going to carry it with me for awhile)</div>

 <div class=reply>OH WE’RE PULLING OUT THE PHOEBE NOW TOO HUH <br><br>(GOD ALSO WHEN HALLOWEEN GOES: ALWAYS SURPRISED BY WHAT I'D DO FOR LOVE, SOME THINGS I’LL NEVER EXPECT)<br><br>also, that’s a really interesting thing to highlight! and oddly intriguing for me to hear? like, i’ve never thought about it until now but — i guess i think of sleep / any kind of rest / letting yourself be unconscious around someone else as such a vulnerable state to be in, so there’s an element of trust &amp; connection that i suppose i attach to having someone just sleep quietly and calmly and comfortably next to you. there’s that ilya kaminsky quote that says you can’t sit in water with just anyone, and for me, the same goes for how you can’t sleep fully at peace next to just anyone, either. at least i don’t think so. idk. looking back, flls itafushi were unable to sync up their sleep until the very last scene in the very last chapter; it’s always megumi embodying this phoebe bridgers line or yuuji being left alone to keep sleeping even when he probably wanted megumi to stay in bed with him, so — anyway. it is funny to think about. sleep, of all things. but i find it nevertheless touching that something about flls has stuck with you in this sense and that it’s a thing to carry at all.</div>

 <div class=question>hi!! i don't have enough or know enough words to express myself, much less how something means me, but i recently finished flls and tracked down your twitter, and i needed you to know that flls means so much to me, it's amazing, it changed me and my views on relationships, and i can't get it into words that would make this whole thing make sense, because i'm bad at words and i want this to make sense. <br><br>i have so much respect for you that i'm writing this down even though i don't know how to write constructive critisism - if this is what this is haha - flls had such a huge impact on me, not really to the point where i would regard it as a,, concern? but yk, lately i haven't been able to read anything the same without comparing it to flls because flls is That much and it's set a high bar for me that not a lot of fics can live up to no matter how hard i try to look into or between the lines.<br><br>i'm sorry if it looks like i'm rambling or this doesn't make sense, but i tried my best to put out how i've been feeling recently. honestly, it surprised me that this is taking so long, i came here with a short message in mind. it's been a week and a half, i think, since i finished flls and i havent been able to move on from it so i took that as a sign, that i needed to get this down on your cc to lift all of those heavy emotions off my chest or, at least, get rid of most because if i'm being honest, i'll never move on from the moment, i might forget about it from time to time due to personal reasons, but all in all, i'll probably grow up to be a crusty old 90-year-old that yeah, would still be crying over flls. (because the fic is downloaded into my files, in case ao3 would be taken down ans i didnt have time to save your work, sorry is that weird?) that's all, i think. i feel like there's more that i want to get out, but i can't stretch until where that limit is. really, just thank you so much for making flls, i am forever your subscriber and will always anticipate what you have next ❤ i love youu</div>

 <div class=reply>whoa whoa whoa whoa okay whoa. this is. whoa. okay. listen, i don’t think you’re bad at words at all; you have expressed Plenty to me from this cc alone, and i am very, very, Very thankful.<br><br>i’m never sure how to reply to these things, honestly. it’s overwhelming in a really good way to know that flls has made an ~impact? for lack of a milder word? on another person? to such a degree that it’s left something to stay with you? i always say this, but in a way, it’s the most i can ask for, knowing that flls has done Something, anything at all, for at least one person. so. god. i’m tearing my hair out trying to find the words to reply to this and all i can come up with is thank you. thank you for holding my little fic in such high esteem, it really is so astonishing. and the timing of this is uncanny as well; my approach to writing has been a bit wonky and not great recently, so this was very much needed. <br><br>thank you for taking the time to send me this, and i promise you have nothing to apologize for. (and no please it’s not weird at all! download in whatever format you’d like; i’m very moved) i am sending you all my love &amp; well wishes 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>i finished first love, last spring a few hours ago and you come off as a very ... as a person who has answers. so could i ask you, how does one learn to let go? to not keep holding onto things that no longer exist? to stop using nostalgia as a tool to hurt yourself... sorry for my english and you might not have the answers to this but i’m sure anything you say will bring me some peace. hope you’re having a nice day :)</div>

 <div class=reply>i’m not sure how to answer, honestly. but there’s a lot of awareness here! like, you know nostalgia is hurting you &amp; that the things you are holding onto no longer exist, and to that end, i totally get it. i think that when we hold onto nostalgia, it’s us relying on what’s familiar. even if the familiar thing hurts. or maybe u believe that putting up with the hurt is easier than starting from scratch somewhere else. maybe you’d rather be half-empty than Completely empty. Or maybe it’s nostalgia as a tool for reminding yourself of the things u are capable of feeling. smth like, “hey, i felt this strongly about this thing once, and that’s worth something.” <br><br>which — yeah, i agree that it is worth something, but it isn’t worth everything. it’s not all that you’ll have. maybe it’s not even all that you had. why are you holding onto nostalgia knowing it hurts you? do you trust that hurt more than any other emotion? are you trying to justify something that hurts in the present only bc it used to be good in the past? are you holding onto something that existed before but doesn’t anymore bc at least it Used to exist and that’s still more than nothing? <br><br>you asked how one learns to let go &amp; the truth is the only way of letting go i know is through time. through letting time take the past away without letting it dominate my present. it’s not always successful, bc i think nostalgia is a valuable emotion and not smth you should completely avoid — but it is when you’re using it as a tool to hurt yourself. ofc i don’t know what your situation is, and i feel like a “live, laugh, love” person when that’s the last thing i wanna be — but i do think you have to let time replace the past with things that actually exist. to let yourself have new emotions. it’s okay to look back every now and then, to miss someone or something, and i don’t think that really goes away, but you’re also allowed to change from the person that you were. for better or for worse, i believe most of us are made of the things we love &amp; the things that love us — but that absorbing should only happen while it’s a present tense love. a current love. a love that still exists. and so maybe we’re not being the selves we can be when we’re stuck in a past / future that doesn’t exist? i’m not sure. <br><br>but yeah. while i appreciate you seeing me as the kind of person with answers, i really am not, and the only thing i can tell you, from what i believe, is that if nothing else, let the past go bc i’ll bet money that it also wants to let you go. plus there’s only so much space in your heart, so you might as well let in the things that do exist. <br><br>and nostalgia can also be kind. it doesn’t have to hurt. let it not hurt, you know? <br><br>this isn’t very coherent. i’m sorry. that said, do not ever apologize for your english, thank you for coming to me with this q &amp; i hope that it all works out for the best for you ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>hi there! i sent you an ask a little bit ago (i wanted the dog keychain), and after some exploration of your carrd because i was curious about your process, i saw those tumblr posts you made and it inspired me. i've been trying to write fic for a bit, or at least wanting to try, but unsure how to start, so when i saw you tracing the lines of your words i went, okay, let's make a doc! so i have this little document now where i'm asking and answering questions and doing story building. it's been a really cool process that's helped me understand what i want better. it's probably going to be a long time before it becomes anything, but i just wanted to thank you because this is the closest i've ever been!</div>

 <div class=reply>HEY. H E Y ☀️🌷🌸🌾 THAT’S SO WONDERFUL. I’M REALLY, REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. THAT’S VERY EXCITING. <br><br>and no, absolutely, take your time figuring things out! i do want to make a note to not be afraid to explore far and beyond to see what feels best, and that might also mean not worrying too much about process if you feel like it’s only impeding you. sometimes the unconscious has to come before the conscious and that’s also okay. <br><br>but anyway. you seem to be finding something in this process, and that makes me super glad. my sincere congratulations, telepathically sending you all the pep talks to hype you up, and all the best of luck to you 💗</div>

 <div class=question>hello, here's my small earnest thank you from the bottom of my soul for writing flls, i don't think i have ever read a fic that has opened me and cut me like a fruit but in way that's understanding, that's about sharing and loving. i am still pondering over the many many themes in the fic but i think the best part was i kept rereading some sentences again and again - lingered over them for quite a while and that's why it took me around two and a half weeks to finish the story fully, progressing through it and seeing the theme of home and compromise explored throughout, i felt really.. thankful for your words especially with it helping me sort out my feelings about moving countries and compromising something to live a life as i do now. again really really thank you for writing such a poignant work, your writing flows beautifully and the little connections you build between the characters and the environment, between the characters themselves and esp among the side characters - all added a certain charm to the story, in a way that it understood me more than i have ever understood myself. (also if it's okay with you, can i download a pdf of flls and annotate it? i am most likely going to read it again and linger over things for a longer while and understand the world through your world)</div>

 <div class=reply>oh, this is beautiful… thank you so much. all the little things you highlight, everything you’ve connected back to how the story has made you feel — i’m very glad, and i’m also incredibly thankful for your words. i’m sorry i can’t match your message for length; i’m just a little bit stunned at how earnest this is and just. thank you very much. (and yes, of course! please do feel free to download and do as you will. i’m honoured you’d want to annotate it.) <br><br>please take care, wherever you are, whatever you’re doing, and i hope everything goes well with moving &amp; beyond.</div>

 <div class=question>coming from someone who had to sit through 4 hours of crit every week at 8am for several terms i'm not even exaggerating the amount bs one has to suffer through -- it makes you want to punch everyone in the room and then yourself so you can finally just fall over and nap -- but i digress. having the generally deadpan megumi experience a Violent Thought is somehow very funny in my head. <br><br>okay but most of my favorite jjk fics so far has at least One Imagery of calloused hands to the point where i feel my heart physically twist upon the word. i love that so much. tenderness in roughness and towards roughness. just itfs holding hands and the sheer domestic warmth/underlying angst around it, esp in this kinda an au where the contrast in their career choices is v pronounced. idk where im going with this exactly i just wanna point that out and Cry.<br><br>on another note, i know we've been straying a little bit too far into art school!au since it's just my first instinct to go with school/college aus for jjk -- gods know how badly i want to give the kids just a Damn Break so they can be dumb children doing dumb children things, but i feel like architect megumi and firefighter yuuji warrant a timeline further into the future - like somewhere past their mid-20s crisis. my brain is too fried for actual thoughts right now but i think it'd be fascinating to re-examine their worldviews and philosophies when they're already their own people in an established relationship. like how often do they get RevelationsTM? how do those RevelationsTM get in the way of their relationship and how they move forward, especially with such volatile career paths? ig its like part of me trying to imagine what their canon would look like if there's a 10-years-later but at the same time i'm so terrified of canon now i cannot for my life-<br><br>NOBARA HAS OPINIONS. and hahaha i can just imagine nanamimi harassing the hECK OUT OF YUUTA if they were fellow photo students. maybe he meets toge through a stunt they pull. toge is usually chalked up as a quiet observant kinda guy but i feel like yuuta is the type to indulge him and crank his Little Shit meter to max tbh. and toge is Very Protective. and yes i'm thinking so much about light design and frames when you put them in that context and i'm !!!<br><br>here lemme just *feeds the au* BUT I DO SHARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME SENTIMENT WITH YOU ON FLLS it's like part of me is like "okay they're in a good place now they can carry on by themselves" but the helicopter parent part me just want to hyperfixate on Every Single Thing. maybe we're just starved for wholesome domestic itfs content i miss them so much.</div>

 <div class=reply>four hours starting from 8am oh my god why would they put you through that … no wonder everyone’s feeling murderous by the end, that’s nothing but a recipe for exhaustion and a bad mood i’m so sorry 😔 but it is Very fun to think of megumi in this context Please he would look so dark and drained by the end the poor guy <br><br>yes, oh my god… hands… the tenderness of the hands… they do so much… they say so much… i am combusting… the two of them building and saving lives on such different scales and coming home to each other to use those same hands to just touch softly and gently. i can’t do this. and yeah for sure! there Are a lot of far-in-the-future themes to be delved into with megumi &amp; yuuji a) having established careers and b) being secure in who they are beyond their relationship. i wanna see the conversations they’ll have, the ways they navigate their differences not just as people but as an architect and a firefighter, respectively. bc there’s smth uncompromising about being an established person in an established relationship, and that need not be a bad thing. and i’m sure it isn’t for them, but there has to be hard-earned work that has gone into it not being a bad thing. you know? damn, i am so attached to this au? and — god, the thought of even having A ten years later for anyone in jjk already feels like wishful thinking. <br><br>NANAMIMI HARASSING YUUTA KSKJDJSJ i want little shit inumaki so very badly. i need it. i need him to be petty and shady as hell on the side. (also, i don’t know if i’ve said this, but it really is super cool that you went to art school that makes me 🤩)<br><br>thank you for the food 😔 and Stop you really nailed it re: leaving flls alone bc i’m really just starved for wholesome domestic itfs content. it looks like flls strayed so far from wholesome and i feel awful about it everyday and i just want to write the domesticity they deserve.</div>

 <div class=question>wow i just finished flls for the second time and i- *skshshdkdkssksj* it really is a great take on relationships and love in general. i really love your writing. (i think i've been following you since your bnha fic days? but didn't really have the balls to say hi ^-^') and i just got into jjk and reading your fics was just...........kinda mindblowing tbh. will you ever consider writing satosugu? they really are a fantastic dynamic to deal with. also what are your favorite books?</div>

 <div class=reply>the second time ??? and following me since bnha ?? hello ?? thank you so much ??? that’s like. four years’ worth of writing. a couple of people have pointed out how much my writing has changed since bnha and i now feel hyperconscious of it — in a good way — so my point is that i’m thankful you’ve stuck around for as long as you have and even reread flls 🤍<br><br>as for stsg, i don’t want to concretely promise anything, but i’m leaning these days towards a yes to writing them! or. as in. there’s a wip floating around. but if i do, it will probably just be in the flls universe. i don’t quite trust myself to write them otherwise. <br><br>and ahhhh i always blank when it comes to favourites bc i feel like i love anything and nothing, but right now, assuming that fav books = fav novels, my current top one is the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne. it’s long and does so much and, granted, i haven’t reread it since the first time bc it was so narratively and emotionally stuffed, but it’s the first one to come to mind whenever people ask me for favs. i’m also unfortunately a big sally rooney person, and both of her current books + short stories have been successful at getting me out of reading ruts. and on the other end of the spectrum to that, i burned through jeanette winterson’s works through 2020 and i just blanket-like her style. <br><br>(and these aren’t favs yet, but right now, i’m reading memorial by bryan washington &amp; little weirds by jenny slate and both have been the needed kind of immersive.)</div>

 <div class=reply>a little bit of both, i think. the sitting down to write was almost easy in itself, bc us is basically what one of my first drafts looks like before i actually go back in to edit and ~beef it up. as far as typing and going from scene to scene goes, it was straightforward and there wasn’t any rewriting involved bc i wanted to get it all done in one sitting in time for the last day of itfs week, etc. and the result is kinda this sparseness that i don’t often do? like you said, it’s very short and simple and, in a way, that made it easy?<br><br>but also. it being short and simple had me kinda conflicted 🧍🏻‍♀️ the sparseness made it feel like it wasn’t enough / incomplete / not really worth anything, so i really do mean it when i say i’m relieved to hear people being so kind about reading it. going from writing 113k to 5k was just… not ideal, in terms of what my brain wants to be cruel to me about so. that part wasn’t easy. i was sure i was going to post us anonymously until the last second. and i’m still at that stage where i want to delete it. <br><br>but i did learn a few bits from writing something that i felt was a step removed from my comfort zone + i’m glad i got to do a thing for itfs week. so in the end, it’s maybe neither hard nor easy, but it’s all fine and alright. not great, but balanced enough.</div>

 <div class=question>ah I had listened to youth - daughter a while ago and tied it to gojo but it does apply really well for the entirety of jjk .... (one more to make myself sad is body - syml. Reminds me of yuuji). And yeah i think you explained it really well that all those space songs have a moment in which the emotion just expands into something larger</div>

 <div class=question>i finished reading first love, late spring mere moments ago and i think— there's no one way i think, right now, but a list of small things. i consume a fair amount of fic these days, and i do not think i have ever cried or felt as genuinely as i had reading this piece. there had been times where i shut off my phone just to fully feel everything it evoked from me and let myself really intake all of it. perhaps it's silly to feel so strongly about a fanfiction, but every single aspect, large and miniscule, was so perfect and on the nose that i'm frankly overwhelmed. i can't even begin to fully articulate my thoughts. but oh my god. it was so, so beautiful— thank you for writing it, genuinely, i feel so wholeheartedly impacted by each and every nuance. perhaps this is better suited as a comment under the work itself— my apologies for having no questions aside from the praise, but the simple fact is that i'm shy but i needed to pass along the utter emotion your writing brought out for me in some manner. thank you, honestly and fully, for this piece</div>

 <div class=reply>i genuinely don’t know how to respond to this other than to — first off — say thank you, honestly and fully as well. i always have to put a good chunk of the credit on any reader for being open to feeling the emotions that a story is trying to offer, because i think that requires a lot of anyone, so thank you so much for that! this is so very kind and well-articulated, and you need not feel silly (i believe) or to apologize at all. thank you for taking the time to leave me this. thank you for taking the time to read flls and to feel things about it and to even sit with it sometimes. that’s unreal to me, and i’m very touched and grateful. i wish you all the best. i hope you’re staying safe. take care 🌷🤍</div>

 <div class=question>I absolutely adored first love last spring - your writing is absolutely exquisite and when I recently went back to reread it, I noticed so many small details that I didn't before that just made it all the better for me. Besides how well written Megumi and Yuuji were (and basically every single character you wrote, honestly), I was really compelled by how you depicted Gojo and Getou -- I was wondering if you had any small details about them that you wanted to include in the fic / you imagined for them that didn't make it into the fic in the end?</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you so, so much! and the fact that you reread! and the small details! god. that means a ton.<br><br>also, i started writing a prequel-sequel flls stsg the other night bc i was curious and while it likely won’t see the light of day as it is, it did leave me with a few thoughts about them floating around — so thank you for this q ☀️<br><br>• in the two yrs between ch 6 &amp; 7, getou has started writing a memoir. but it didn’t feel like the sort of thing megumi would mention by itself, and it felt like too much for him to go through every single person in their family and what they’re up to, so i left it out. <br><br>• stsg have a villa in okinawa that they take the kids to every summer + riko and sometimes shoko and utahime<br><br>• neither of them are particularly bad or great at cooking, but you won’t be able to tell from how nice and well-stocked their kitchen is. when the kids all move out and on, i think they get someone to start coming in to cook, mostly to free up time during the busy days of the week. <br><br>plus a few things i’ve mentioned in previous ccs but couldn’t find space for in the last two chapters: <br><br>• getou’s only initial motivation for moving to the yushima house are stability for nanamimi<br><br>• it gets really quiet &amp; lonely when the girls all move out of the prefecture at once, and for the first couple of months, they don’t really know how to handle being alone with each other like they used to when they were younger <br><br>• it meant a lot to both of them when getou first started renovating the garage, but they don’t actually start talking about what the renovations mean for their rs until maybe the third one. i like to think that’s why yuuji describes it as “loaded” in ch 5 when he overhears them talking about doing smth to one of the third floor rooms. <br><br>and this last one is not a small detail at all and is exactly why it wasn’t included in the fic bc it would have been so jarring — but when i was conceptualizing stsg’s backstory, there was this detail about gojo having an incident as a kid where his life was put in genuine danger. nothing kdrama level, and it’s totally ridiculous and over-the-top to mention out of context, but it’s one of those things in the back of my mind whenever i get in the mood to write more of their flls verse selves. i can’t say flls itself gets into it, bc in retrospect megumi knows nothing about his father and/or gojo’s childhoods, but there’s a lot of history there that’s just a little bit scratched with any mention of gojo having a messy childhood bc he grew up in a high-profile family. that kind of thing.</div>

 <div class=question>Saturn was probably the first song I heard from sal a couple years ago and no matter how many times I listen to the song, it makes my heart ache. And in such a nice way. I feel like it was life changing for me too since I can remember what I was doing and the scenery around me so vividly while hearing the song. I find it interesting how much a emotional weight a song can carry so I often like to hear how people associate diff things with diff songs. And it’s jjk brain rot season sooo ya. But thanks for all those song recs!! I’ll be sure to listen to them and have them deconstruct my heart</div>

 <div class=reply>i think mine as well! at least the first sal song i knew was sal. and same… it’s the way it swells, i think. a lot of the space songs have this beautiful structure to them that isn’t afraid to build up and sort of explode outwards and i really love that in instrumentation. <br><br>(also, speaking of emotional weight in songs — The song to really get me no matter what is youth by daughter, and as i was listening to it just now, i realized it’s strangely apt for jjk, too.)</div>

 <div class=question>do listen to sleeping at last? I feel like you’d like their songs. I’ve just been thinking that their song Neptune would fit megumi so well that it’s just been invading my brain. Also, do you have any songs that you associate with any jjk characters or pairs or scenes etc?</div>

 <div class=reply>i do. religiously. no matter how my music taste changes over the years, sal will somehow always be my number one most listened to. i could be in a hyperpop phase and it would still top my spotify charts. i don’t know how he does it. i still maintain that i want to learn to write in a way that makes readers feel how sal songs make Me feel. <br><br>but anyway Yes. oh my god yeah. when i first watched/read the end of the cursed womb arc, i remember immediately associating it with “i wanna tell you but i don't know how / i'm only honest when it rains” g o d that hits like nothing else<br><br>as for any songs i associate with jjk, i think i mentioned last words of a shooting star by mitski for yuuji + peace by taylor swift for itafushi in another cc, but beyond that, there’s a part in walked through hell by anson seabra that goes like this:<br><br>I would've walked through hell<br>To find another way<br>I would've laid me down<br>If I knew that you would stay<br>I would've crossed the stars<br>To keep you in my life<br>But now I'm falling hard<br>Without you here tonight<br><br>and i associate it with the cursed womb arc as well. there’s white ferrari by frank ocean. this december by ricky montgomery. naked as we came by iron &amp; wine. all itafushi to me. otherside by perfume genius is a stsg to me and i only have a vague idea why. dirty paws by of monsters &amp; men is a song that i attach to jjk in general. funeral by phoebe bridgers makes me think of haibara. i’m sure there are tons more that go deeper into my music library but i never compile these things anywhere and we’re at the mercy of my sleep-less memory bank. <br><br>(also, last thing bc i can’t not say this: this cc was so well timed; jupiter by sleeping at last came on shuffle this morning and i’ve been thinking all day about how nothing will ever hit me again the way the atlas space songs did the first time as a teenager. like. saturn was life changing. and it continues to be every time i listen to it.)</div>

 <div class=question>SCULPTOR MEGUMI IS ACTUALLY VERY CONVINCING THOUGH. i had that thought too, but then i thought since megumi tends to lean more, as you said, big-picture i kinda had this scene of him falling asleep one too many times during critiques and just going fuck this so hard i'm out. but also one Interesting Thought: i think so much about the hands when it comes to megumi -- with his entire canon technique being shadow puppets and also how we've been talking about his tendency to act out on his thoroughly mulled over feelings - like when you think about actions you think about the hands first? and i just imagine megumi to be very tactile, in every sense of the word - his craft, actions, feelings, and himself, to me, all feel like hard-earned affection and grace, like he loves and knows quietly but no less passionately. he wants so much but not until it's perfect so he just steps down and waits in line instead but he burns either way. re: that flashback scene with gojo right before he uses domain expansion - i think that's gonna translate into the vices of architect megumi right there.<br>and then the parallels and contrasts between architect megumi and firefighter yuuji oH MAN THESE TWO they're just so similar and so so different at the same time it's just fascinating in every universe. firefighter yuuji where his touches are fast and instinctual and kind of rough as opposed to megumi's tender and fleeting yet surgical. like megumi's very black-or-white yes but in yuuji's line of work it's literally do-or-die sometimes and how do they come to terms with that? so many parallels to keep myself awake at night i can't even-<br>and then with stsg i actually had them originally with getou as the critic but then i started thinking of their student times ans how getou was definitely the idealist of the two whereas gojo was forced into cynicism too young and too fast. with these roles though i def think they can switch around!! my actual reasoning was just that having art history student nobara under gojo's wings seemed like it was going to be some chaotic fun haha. and then on the topic of dancer toge i also really want to write random bypasser yuuta in all his side-character-esque glory just growing hopelessly enamored haha idk i just wanted boy next door vs sassy divo inuokko. <br>and yes yes absolutely do take the ideas and run wild!!! i'm more a concept artist than a writer and i love just tossing ideas back and forth with people to see how it can grow bigger, or even be fulfilled, no pressure on you ofc. also if anything else id be honoured to have my rampant plot bunnies be realized into your writing no matter what form it takes because i could only imagine ever sounding so wise and tender 🥺 <br>god and im just imagining megumi pairing one of yuuji's worn sweaters with like a ridiculously overpriced acne studios jacket and nobara losing her mind over it thANK YOU</div>

 <div class=reply>FALLING ASLEEP AT CRITIQUES. PLEASE. AND THE HANDS. I KNOW. i feel like i always default to hands = actions = care with him, but you phrase it so beautifully here that i can’t even be mad at myself about it. it’s also interesting that you bring up “wants so much but not until it's perfect” in this context, because yeah, i think that’s a really wonderful way to approach architect megumi. wanting perfection would be such a burden for something so based on the details and the layers that go into one big full structure, and there’s so much there that warrants exploring and it makes me clench my fists (in a really, really good way.) i haven’t stopped thinking about it. thank you so much for this. <br><br>fast and instinctual vs fleeting yet surgical makes me want to scream + now that i’m reading this over a third time i’m also curious about the concept of sacrifice for firefighter yuuji. bc it is do-or-die, yet there is also an underlying selfishness sometimes in heroism or, going by yuuji’s canon self &amp; philosophy, there’s something i find almost incomplete or misled about thinking that just bc you d— surrounded by people or you die protecting more than you’ve harmed, that’s a life well-lived. or like. how do you reconcile being in danger protecting others with having loved ones that will have to worry about You being in danger. but i’m sorry these are very disjointed thoughts i’m thinking on the page as usual and i know we started with firefighter yuuji saving a cat. the takeaway here is that i love firefighter yuuji with all my heart. <br><br>ART HISTORY STUDENT NOBARA !! oh my god i love that. i adore that so much. i can Hear her in an art history class already. and “side-character-esque glory” made me giggle god boy next door yuuta is The yuuta for me and to have a divo dancer inumaki i’m losing it at imagining what that dynamic would look like. i think i’d also love a photographer yuuta (still in his side character esque glory) with a dancer inumaki? <br><br>THANK YOU SO MUCH. BOTH FOR YOU SAYING SUCH KIND THINGS ABT MY WRITING BUT ALSO THE ARCHITECT MEGUMI GREENLIGHT. HE HAS TAKEN OVER MY MIND. HE WON’T LEAVE. THE AU KEEPS GETTING BIGGER.<br><br>also Stop don’t do this to me i already miss writing flls so bad and you’re giving me ideas 😔 i’m just going to let myself laugh at nobara losing it bc Yes Exactly megumi would do that — and then i have to move on. i can’t think about them more or i’ll crack.</div>

 <div class=reply>maybe chapter five? it was far from the easiest one to write, but it definitely felt the most comfortable. my brain felt very... quiet? while writing it. there wasn’t as much pressure to keep feeding the story momentum bc both myself and the reader knew where we were heading at the end of that chapter. it had its own forward motion, in a way, which halved the work for me and just let me focus on following emotional &amp; conversational beats. and that made writing all the dialogue super exciting, the fight scene included; i remember hating that i had to pull out of this funky little rhythm to break up a few segments with introspection. so. yeah. i do know how it sounds to say chapter five is my favourite of them all yikes but i promise it’s solely bc it was fun putting it together.</div>

 <div class=question>Sé que no hablas español y que seguramente esto no vaya a ser respondido, pero realmente necesito decírtelo (quizá en un futuro lo haga ene inglés, cuando no me tome tanto esfuerzo, lmao). First love, tale spring es, de lejos, el mejor ItaFushi fic que he leído. Cada palabra caló en mí, se insertó en mis retinas y procesó durante horas y horas en las que no estaba leyendo el fic. Fue maravilloso, desde la emoción pura de encontrar algo que está tan bien escrito, sus personajes, el desarrollo alrededor de ellos. Hice un click instantáneo con ellos, como si fuera una fotografía de un panorama que acabas de descubrir y amaste al instante. Soy un poco como Itadori, pasé por algo parecido con alguien, no teníamos espacio en nuestra vida para el otro; pero, a diferencia de estos dos muchachos, yo no encontré mi camino de vuelta a él, porque el amor no fue tan intenso y a su vez tan amable. Es increíble el cómo ellos, con su inexperiencia, decidieron darse un espacio para sanar las cosas que traían detrás y después poder ofrecerse al otro, sin capas de dudas o incertidumbre. No tengo palabras para describir la emoción que me embarga al haber leído FLLS, porque me sentí en la piel de ellos, pasé cada gama de sentimiento, dolor, felicidad, vacío, como si fuera el mío hjfdks. Y eso es lo hermoso de encontrar alguien que pueda darte la experiencia de vivir a través de las palabras, ¡tú hiciste eso! Y no solo conmigo, sino con muchas personas más. Esto, mi querida autora, es lo que llamamos un escritor de calidad. ;; Por eso, mi devoción a cada frase que atraviesa tu mente y plasmas, porque sé que algún día verán la luz y alcanzarán a otros, nos conectará. <br><br>Espero sigas escribiendo y siendo tan genial. &lt;3 Te mando un abrazote. (Aún siento que tengo mucho que decir y no sé cómo, i'm ruined ;_;)</div>

 <div class=reply>this q had me scrambling bc i suddenly couldn’t remember a single piece of anything i’ve consumed in my entire life and i know i’ll kick myself for forgetting so many but — okay. i don’t know if this is meant for flls or just itafushi more broadly so. i’ll do both with whatever i can remember. <br><br>i know i named the fic after flls but the mitski that informed the whole thing was actually i will, and i think that will always be The flls!megumi mitski for me. then maybe geyser for yuuji. and that part in i want you where it goes “you’re coming back [...] we’re starting over” kept playing for me in the last ch + francis forever is always powerful (also, me and my husband for flls!stsg)<br><br>for canon yuuji, last words of a shooting star was the first mitski i associated with him and i — sorry. and i’m not very well-versed in my tswift, but peace is The itafushi song for me. basically the whole thing. <br><br>i’m realizing these are all songs and 96% are mitski, so here are a bunch of poem fragments / quotes from this cc that i associate with canon itafushi: https://curiouscat.qa/sleeptowns/post/1183516300<br><br>i also saw someone translate a line from antigone as “i know that i am dying. why not die for this?” and that was all yuuji to me. then there’s this translation of hopscotch by julio cortázar that goes, “as if you could pick in love, as if it were not a lightning bolt that splits your bones and leaves you staked out in the middle of the courtyard” and it made me think of megumi choosing to save yuuji. neil hillborn’s “yes, there is a place where someone loves you before and after they learn what you are,” too, which has me on a chokehold for post-shibuya itafushi. and finally, this bit from horatio by t.j klune: <br><br>I turn my head toward him. “What is it? What’s our faith?”<br><br>“Each other,” he replies, and it’s pretty, these words, and though they should be hollow, I know he’s right. I love him, impossibly, irrevocably, though I haven’t said the words. “We have each other, and that’s all we need.” <br><br>—<br><br>p.s. i started listening to strawberry blonde while mulling over this and ohhhhhh oh o h i am having emotions</div>

 <div class=question>hi there! i apologize for this ask, but i read flls in under 24 hours and i was desperately falling short of explaining to anyone in my life what the fic meant to me, so i thought i might as well communicate it to the author. i'd like to compliment you properly, but i think i'm just in shock that i read 110,000 words when i haven't read a book in ages that this might just be me just expressing shock. you have solidified a connection between me and jjk. what you wrote is the thing that pushed me over the edge, has me thinking i can't wait to be there with everyone when season 2 drops and i can't wait to read the manga. the weirdest thing is, even though i was so invested in your itadori and megumi, i can't get over the nanami and itadori. i have no idea why that's what stuck with me, but something about it was so impossibly special and safe. you did such a wonderful job at building a community in the book, the support system you created for itadori brought such a level of comfort to the fic. and the analysis you did, particularly with megumi, just so..... i blacked it out because it was weirdly personal to me but i remember being so touched and thinking it was so personal. and yet, i am still like... really fixed in on nanami and itadori and i can't figure out why. also, i really want the dog keychains. like badly. they must sell dog keychains somewhere. okay! if i ever collect my thoughts properly i will be sending you a more coherent ask probably. thank you so much for 113399 words. that is literally crazy</div>

 <div class=reply>no please, please, please don’t apologize for this, i’m very grateful you took the time to communicate all this to me, and i’m incredibly touched to hear that i contributed to your connection with something to love. thank you. <br><br>nanami &amp; yuuji’s flls — and beyond — dynamic is also one of my favourites. the healthiness of it all (from my perspective), the unconditional love &amp; care and how nanami took on this spot as yuuji’s family. it was very cathartic for me to write that for yuuji, so i’m really glad it stayed with you. <br><br>also re: the dog keychains: me too !! i checked the other day and the official (?) mappa store actually sells them i believe !! <br><br>all in all, reading 113k words in 24 hours is also pretty amazing, and i really just want to thank you for giving my little story a shot and staying with it the whole way through. it means a lot to know it means something to you, so thank you so, so much for this and for reading.</div>

 <div class=question>hello hello jacket anon here!! i'm so glad it made sense to you lol i had a Moment Filled with Regret the second i hit sent because i was like ok maybe the thought was so In My Own Head. <br><br>idrk i guess my point of reference was just?? i went to art school and all the architecture kids owned like an ungodly amount of corduroy??? also the boots+cropped pants combo good lord lemme tell you if i had a cent for every time i saw someone wear/wore that myself. ok hear me out vet sci megumi is such a straightforward interpretation of him into college au and i love it but also!!! i guess this is just, again, my constant exposure to art school kids speaking but, i think the meticulous and methodical side to megumi fits architecture so well. like the, i don't know how to explain this without using imagery, but he seems to be like the type to unconsciously give every building he's in a thorough architectural analysis, or like the type to scratch his chin with his pencil while thinking and then just smudging charcoal all over his damn face? very attentive to minute details, prone to hyperfixate, kind of a quiet genius in what he's doing megumi. i know megumi being bad at feelings is kinda a thing, but i think he actually *thinks* so much about it and *feels* it so much without ever knowing how to really act it out, so i guess i wanted to have a place where he has the space to express his love a little bit more, even if that means molding it into an actual physical space. i think that in particular took inspo from flls, actually, with the "giving yourself space to be who you want to be" and "building a home out of a feeling, a time" bits - i just kinda took that and ran with it literally. id imagine the spaces he design to be kinda exposed wood and full of shadow-light contrast or very brutalist or some combination of that but he does have a Signature Style - lmk if you have a diff take on it!! <br>and firefighter yuuji, oh boy, i saw it in the fanbook and it kinda Ruined me because it's just so... right? tenderhearted and brave and kind and would climb a tree to save a cat yuuji. also something else to kinda balance the overthinker in megumi out - not as in all brawn no brain but kind of (more imagery time again) laughter on a windy bridge overlooking the skyline yuuji. i have so much love for the boy i just want him to be Radiant like he deserves to be. <br>(also art school au would be the perfect opportunity to sneak in art history major nobara and an unsuspecting maki who got talked into becoming a life model for her drawing elective. also contemporary dancer toge. also art critic gojo and tormented painter geto. NANAMIMI photo majors!!! point is im spiralling into so many little headcanons from the mention of a Single Corduroy Jacket and i have you to thank for that. <br><br>also how many of megumi's jackets are stolen (either from yuuji or borrowed from stsg and never returned because he forgot) i need know.</div>

 <div class=reply>NO NO I REALLY APPRECIATED IT. i’ve been thinking about this intermittently for the past couple of days and just. to start, it’s super super school that you went to art school, and second ahhhhh this visual is everything to me. i have a wip somewhere where yuuji’s a dancer &amp; i had sculpture for megumi, just to play with expression in form vs expression in motion blah blah blah but ARCHITECTURE. That’s So Good. that’s so, so good. there’s so much to toy with there, part of which is how megumi is actually occasionally very big-picture / all-or-nothing to me despite the meticulousness you brought up (though i def i agree re: him feeling a lot and not knowing how to really act it out; i think he’s only “bad at feelings” insofar as he is initially more a thinker than a feeler, yet he’s also a very act-based person in how he interacts with those feelings), and so having that kinda contrast with him working with minute details is — my mind is running very, very much. i love how you describe his signature style oh my god i am freaking out. <br><br>and firefighter yuuji… yo… it’s just critical hit after critical hit. and you’re right, you’re right, you’re absolutely right. firefighter yuuji just doing what he can and figuring it out as he goes along vs fushiguro “i planned an entire itinerary for our odaiba trip based on one thing yuuji &amp; nobara said” megumi. ahhh the way you described the imagery for firefighter yuuji has me in tatters, thank you for this i am feeling so much.<br><br>ART HISTORY MAJOR NOBARA DRAWING MAKI. DANCER INUMAKI. NANAMIMI IN PHOTOGRAPHY. and ooooh i think i’d also like an art critic getou and painter gojo in reverse. this is giving me so many thoughts. thank You. <br><br>that said, i kinda started an architect-adjacent megumi wip the other day bc it was haunting me so much — but then i realized it wasn’t my idea to claim, so i wanted to check in with you if this is okay? it’s far, far, far from being an art school au, but i don’t mean to infringe on what is still your first idea and not mine and i figured i should ask first. if you’re uncomfortable, i totally understand, and this wip probably won’t go anywhere. but. again. i thought i should ask. <br><br>also !! i like to think that bc flls!gojo never really knows what to get flls!megumi for his birthday-christmas combo, he just keeps getting him jackets throughout the years and now megumi has this massive collection that he cycles through until he learns to start using yuuji’s jackets even before they start properly living together.</div>

 <div class=question>solidarity is great 😭that 14 year old’s graduated from calling me gay to calling BOTH of us gay, and like—fuck yeah, man!! we suffer together! and omg YEAH there are diff reasons for kids randomly kicking the bucket and i LOSE it every time it happens bc it's like (&amp; i'm quoting here): “CHUG JUG?? died at the age of 1! They died of loneliness.” &amp; “TURKEUY SANDWIC died at the age of 16! The Catholic Church got them…” which is hilarious on like 15 different counts.<br><br>and then OHHH ive never actually seen any r&amp;j adaptations which is,, such a horrible shame i really want to. but yeah everything you said abt the baz lurhamnn adaptation sounds super spot on i get you so much!!! and about everything else too 🥺 lol my lit class was talking and we all unanimously agreed r&amp;j was way more fun than any of the other units we did which is so vindicating honestly.<br><br>and oh!! fuck yeah nostalgia omg tlc and soc are both so fun and melina marchetta is so fucking talented omg like SO good . i've only read jellicoe road (abt 5 times but still) but it's stuck with me so much. and trc!! god i bet i've read it like thrice i really wanna reread it but 😭 i get u,, reading it for the first time was an Experience. and JHFDHJ funny that u mention sarah dessen bc a friend of mine was talking abt her like a week or so ago and we were talking abt how even tho yeah shes pretty white cishet suburbia etc her work is still so genuine and enjoyable and FUN to read unlike a ton of other popular YA contemporary. there's a lot of really good contemporary though, gosh—if ur ever in the mood to read YA, i feel like you’d like emily henry, laura silverman, maybe alice oseman, melissa keil, cath crowley? wild &amp; crooked by leah thomas is an absolute fav too. but yes whatever!! gosh it feels like every time i send one of these i load in a whole list of recs 😭 pls don't feel obligated to go thru these!!! man. it's my inner book nerd barging out—istg whenever anyone mentions books in a 10m vicinity i noticeably perk up and round on them like some kinda homing beacon. it was 90% of my personality for like, years—and, well, still is, i guess. books just branched out into comics &amp; fics &amp; poetry too, which is cool and funky. god bless i am so lucky to have a hobby 💀 people in school like.. don't read.. and i'm like.. bro bro what do you do all day ..<br><br>i read the flls chap the hr it came out and it's been simmering in my head for dayssss, god, ive got a half written up comment saved in my gay little notes app bc i physically couldnt contain myself and had to scribble out my reactions while reading. yeah i just 😭 god ill comment soon 🥺 i loved it unendingly. unilaterally. wholly. it was so fucking good.<br><br>ur pitching arm must be pretty good im catching the vibes &amp; blowing a whole bunch back in little heart-shaped bubbles!! i hope you’ve been doing well! p.s.: ur cc abt writing made my face scrunch up like those crying cat memes 🥺 - zi 🧚🏽‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>graduated sure is an interesting word for it but good for you both! or them, mostly? solidarity is solidarity and i respect it deeply. ALSO PLEASE I FORGOT THE CONTEXT OF THIS FOR A GOOD SECOND AND I WAS LIKE. excuse me?? why are kids kicking the bucket? hello? TURKEUY SANDWIC is my favourite we love TURKEUY SANDWIC in this household. rip TURKEUY SANDWIC. i, too, was got by the catholic church at some point and i’m sorry for your loss. <br><br>up until this past year, i’ve only ever seen the r&amp;j movies, but there was like a whole slew of free productions that cropped up when the lockdown first started and i just. went through them. bc why not. and some are closer than others to how i see the play — but yeah. it always comes down to the shift in tone pre- and post- mercutiio’s 💀 i think. and ahhh i never got to experience r&amp;j in class thank god bc i know no high school teacher of mine would have taught a class who saw r&amp;j that way so i am vindicated by your vindication<br><br>and yeah !! series books were just so difficult bc of the year-long wait for the next one but fun is fun !! i love a good retelling and tlc did what it can. trc is also unparalleled with Atmosphere and Aesthetic and i miss how it made me feel at that age every day. and completely agree with sarah dessen, like will i sometimes sigh just reading the premise to her books? yes. will i buy it anyway? absolutely. and oooooh yes contemporary is more my speed, and i have read a few laura silvermans and alice oseman’s heartstopper (though not her novels yet), but i’ll look into the rest for sure — and omg wild and crooked sounds sick. i feel like i have to wait for the ya contemporary mood to Hit and then it’s all i want to read for like a couple of months. and god no i truly appreciate all your recs. none of my immediate circle of friends save for one are big fiction readers anymore, and so. i’m very grateful. I FEEL THAT THING ABT WONDERING WHAT HOBBY-LESS PEOPLE DO. BC RIGHT. GENUINELY. but no ahhh it makes my heart warm that you have so much love for books and are so open to sharing that love so really, sincerely, thank you for loving stories and sharing your recs with me. <br><br>OH WHOA the flls chap was so far in the back of my mind that this jolted me. thank you so so much and i promise that you need not feel obligated to comment !! (also “gay little notes” dhsjks) it really means so much already as is ❤️<br><br>LITTLE HEART-SHAPED BUBBLES. WE LOVE THAT TOO. and this one’s for you, TURKEUY SANDWIC. i am busy but okay! how are you! and ahh thank you? i hope? is it good scrunching up?</div>

 <div class=reply>megumi’s oddly vast collection of jackets is one of my favourite unnecessary little things in flls please like 113k words, 7 chapters, and this guy did not wear the same one twice<br><br>BUT ALSO HOLD ON. WE NEED TO UNPACK. WHY ARE CORDUROY JACKETS AN ARCHITECT THING. I LOVE THAT. I LOVE THAT SO MUCH. ALSO THE CONCEPT OF ARCHITECT MEGUMI IS. OVERLOADING MY BRAIN BIG TIME RIGHT NOW.

 <div class=reply>i wish my answer to this was, like, paris review levels of poignant but the short ver is that i write bc it’s fun. without unpacking why it is, and how fun is even defined here — it’s just fun, period. <br><br>the longer, Overly Serious &amp; Personal™ answer is that i guess i was a lonely kid, then i was a lonely teen, and spitting words &amp; worlds out to a doc was like a promotion from the daydreaming &amp; acting out stories to myself that i did in childhood. too much daydreaming, too much talking to yourself? that’s a step away from concerning. but turning the same sentiments into a ✨ hobby ✨? that’s at least arguably productive.<br><br>y’know how distinguished writers say that they write to make sense of their lives/themselves? i admire that, except i didn’t start writing to make sense of anything, least of all myself. writing isn’t me making sense of anything. that part comes after. i started writing bc i wanted to talk a lot more than i was getting the chance to. abt a book i read. a show i watched. until it became my default form of connection with the world. love smth; write abt it. bc beyond this, i’m not a person who feels very deeply about myself — yet i write characters that do, and i love them all the more for it. when i ~write, esp but not exclusive to fic, it’s like yelling out, do you love this character, too? is this enough? can you feel how much tenderheartedness i feel towards this character? to this kind of human? and when someone says, "hell yeah, that resonates with me!” that’s a convo right there. that’s a balm to loneliness. bc the love is real, even when i don’t feel strongly abt anything else, and it’s reached someone. <br><br>i don’t have a platitude like “writing is home,” either. writing isn’t home. home are the people, real and not, that i love through my words. from a bday card to a fic to even a cc answer like this. it’s not writing that i’ve always done. and if, by this definition, that makes me not a writer so much as just a person with smth to love &amp; therefore smth to say — that’s fine, too. i can live with that. <br><br>that said, writing is fun bc to love smth is fun. fun bc loving asks nothing of you. fun bc you get to be a diff person for a bit when you’re loving smth new. fun bc loving smth is the only way i know to connect with the world in a way that doesn’t feel unsafe. and i say this with certainty bc — going back to where we started in this paragraph — if i swap out ‘loving’ for ‘writing’ in these last few sentences, it wouldn’t change the meaning at all.<br><br>so. okay. i guess the real short answer is that writing, to me, is just my one and only love language. that’s all. in everything that a love language is, for better or for worse.<br><br>anyway bleh this got sappy as hell sorry but tysm for this q i’ll go back to sleep now 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>i absolutely won’t say never. i opened a doc last night and wrote about 1.3k words for itfs just living their domestic life in funabashi and while it was fun and the result was something i found tender and ~on brand enough — i do think their story is over. i brought them back to a beginning that feels complete and i have nothing else to add as a separate story. which isn’t to say the possibility doesn’t haunt me! i miss them already and want to write them more! but again. i feel like i can be rest assured that they’re doing well without writing about it, even if it means just having stray little headcanons that won’t go anywhere. <br><br>but i say don’t call never on it bc there are like 50 other things going on in the background of flls that aren’t just itfs and we never know when the need to revisit those will strike. and established rs itfs vibing in the background of someone else’s love conflicts would be so funny to me.</div>

 <div class=question>Hi! I wanted to leave a comment for flls but figured it might be better to say it here instead of on ao3 since my comment has manga spoilers. That being said, if you haven’t read ch 143 yet, please ignore this!<br><br>///////<br><br>I don’t even know where to begin with how beautiful this fic is and how long it has been since the last time I’ve found one that resonated so deeply with me. One thing I always sort of look for in fics is how the writer interprets the characters from the source material, and I don’t know if it’s by design or was done unconsciously, but there were so many parallels that I picked up from the manga?<br><br>For example, because it’s still fresh in my mind as ep 24 just came out, how the lack of communication between Yuuji and Megumi in the OoO aftermath is what led to the events in Shibuya. By hiding the fact that Yuuji swallowing Sukuna’s finger is what activated the recent curses, it led to something disastrous and caused them to be apart, just because they believed they were protecting the other’s heart that way. And I feel like it’s the same in flls, where due to their communication breakdown and inability to express what they need to, they ended up in a position where they had to leave each other. (Bonus points for Nobara acting as a Megumi’s confidante in the manga, similar to how she acts as a middle person in flls!)<br><br>Which brings me to the last chapter of flls where Megumi is so? honest? and bare? He knows Yuuji so well, knows what to say to him and most importantly, how to say it in a way the Yuuji understands what he means. I couldn’t help paralleling this with ch 143 of the manga when Megumi convinces Yuuji to come back in a way that he knows Yuuji can’t refuse because he knows what Yuuji needs to emotionally ground him. <br><br>There’s so much more I want to say, like how in canon Gojou sought out Nanami for Yuuji’s mental condition and how Nanami carries on the same role here; how Yuuji can easily fight alongside Nobara, Nanami and Todo but during Shibuya Megumi said it was difficult for him to match with Yuuji, similar to how Yuuji’s relationships with other people are easy but not with Megumi, etc, etc. Transplanting all these little things from canon to a non-canon setting is what adds to the experience and what makes it feel real to me. These are things that I can actually imagine the characters doing if they weren’t where they are in canon. It felt true to their essence, and your writing wonderfully brings them to life. <br><br>I can only hope that Yuuji and Megumi in canon will reach the same or similar level of peace and connection as in flls…/stares at Gege’s cyclops cat avatar/…, but at least I’ll have this fic to comfort me as an alternate “what-if” when we get whatever chaotic end Gege has in mind. <br><br>As an aside, I cackled at the 76ers and Embiid reference.</div>

 <div class=reply>i think i like to write aus bc it gives me space to make the unconscious canon stuff conscious in a setting that’s a bit more low-stakes, where the world won’t get in the way of sinking into emotions/emotional consequences. if that makes sense. idk. with flls, the initial concept was a parallel to the convo bw yuuji &amp; megumi @ the juvenile detention centre, except in a philosophy seminar. but then other things got in the way, and as the story grew, i had to keep pulling parallels from canon so it feels more ~fleshed out the way i want it to be and—yeah. hopefully not to be fake deep but like. communication (or lack thereof) is a given in any itfs characterization, so flls had to do the work somehow of translating it into their love languages, into their ideas of what being good for each other entails, into what it means to not make the other person regret such and such. there’s so much conflict in their canon dynamic (to use the term broadly) and part of the fun was figuring out how their canon selves/relationship (in everything from how they met/what drew them to eo to having to lose each other at some point) translate into a world where their trauma + difficult choices have manifested differently. itfs is itfs to me bc of their love for eo, but that love does come with friction/tension and at times over-devotion, for lack of a better word. not to mention there are also times where their philosophies abt certain things don’t quite mesh seamlessly, which they both react to so differently in turn. and so. yeah. flls was just taking all of this and making it abt love &amp; nothing else, in everything that smth so complicated entails ✌🏼<br><br>AND YES 143 was Such a godsend when i was struggling with ch 7. i needed megumi to be more straightforward, but we haven’t seen him in canon for like a year until this ch and i just remember being like Oh Thank God and sitting down to write my seventh draft or whatever bc i finally have smth to feed into it w/o feeling like it’s baseless conjecture. it was super cathartic to be able to have him be deliberate with his words, to just be so straight up with smth he knows yuuji has always wanted to be able to do for him. so thanks, 143, for coming when you did. <br><br>i’m running out of space but yeah there are so many parallels that i looped in atm bc it’s what felt right, &amp; now that i can kinda look back at it altogether, it just makes me feel all the more fond of this au world &amp; whatever miracle had me managing to finish it. so it means all the more when i get msgs like these where i kinda just feel other people’s emotions abt it, or hear all the lil things people like &amp; take note of. love is stored in the attention paid to your heartwork and all, and also just in hearing that your silly little words resonated with someone. so thank you very, very much for this. <br><br>(and omg please i can’t hear “trust the process” without thinking of embiid it’s actually unreal i had to include it)</div>

 <div class=reply>PLEASE OKAY LISTEN first of all thank you for noticing i am so heart eyed rn and second i told myself i wasn’t gonna do the cyclical stuff for flls bc i’ve done it for, like, probably too many other fics already but is it really being always at the beginning if you don’t return to the beginning somehow? 😔 i swear i resisted it until i decided on the last radio song request and it kinda just. was how it worked out. i was too tickled by how “one more time, one more chance” was the perfect song for a slow roll to the end credits that i had to keep it.</div>

 <div class=reply>i guess i wanna ask first what you mean by stuck? <br><br>bc sometimes it’s a matter of just changing where you’re writing from the bedroom to the living room, the house to the backyard, etc. a change of scenery does wonders for stimulation when you feel like words aren’t flowing. or are you stuck on the word level? are you maybe overthinking every word too much, wanting to make it too pretty? bc i think there is such a thing as too pretty in some cases. sometimes, wanting to make smth beautiful means working deliberately towards making it that, choosing words you think are pretty, are deep-sounding. but deep-sounding isn’t always the depth you need to continue. and sometimes you lose a lot by getting caught up on the right next word. which. i personally don’t think there’s a right next word. but there is a right next sentence, and sometimes you have to sacrifice a pretty word in favor of a hopefully pretty sentence that does the job of getting you to the next one and not being stuck. if that makes sense. <br><br>or, maybe, is it stuck as in “where does the story go from here”? at which point my best general answer would be to maybe change one part of the scene you’re struggling with: setting, weather, someone’s clothes, what someone’s eating or drinking. nothing is too big or too small, just that maybe not enough attention is being paid to one thing that might give you a nudge towards not being stuck, if even a little. being stuck in this case equals being stagnant, and the enemy of stagnance is a change, a shift. something to unpack. so. someone taking a sip comes with a noticed change in body language; automatically, that means the person whose head you’re writing from is paying attention. why are they paying attention? why are they watching? does the watching come with a motive? are they watching bc they like the other person? are they watching bc they’re wary? ofc things like these won’t finish the scene for you, but since we’re talking about being stuck, i think there’s always more to unpack in the things you haven’t gotten to yet. and there are Always things you haven’t gotten to yet. <br><br>and if you’re stuck on a more personal sense—are you comparing yourself to another writer? echoing a style you admire is a foundation for starting with writing, and it will get you somewhere, but it’s also very debilitating in the long-term for how you view your own writing. you have something to say. it doesn’t have to be said according to how someone else would have. are you stuck bc you’re trying to find the words they would have used?<br><br>with all this said, big disclaimer that my process doesn’t have to be yours, and i’m only talking from what’s worked for me! which, honestly speaking, isn’t smth i’ve taken the time to articulate the way i tried to here. i’m sorry if it’s not the most clear, so please feel free to send any follow up ccs in case i can clarify my rambling!</div>

 <div class=question>Hi! I hope I'm not bothering, but I have a question to ask. Do you project into the fics you write, or do you analyse each character and think of how they would react in the scenes in your head, how they would fit with each other, how they would react in the scenes they fit with each other etc?</div>

 <div class=reply>when it comes to ~original stuff, i’ve def used my fair share of my own self – but for fic, it’s a hard no. never. or at least i try very hard not to? the only exception is this one longfic i wrote at 15, &amp; based on how that felt for me, i’ve made it sort of a rule (if anything at all is conscious in my ~writing) to make sure there’s nothing — or at least very little — of my own psyche in my fics. don’t know how successful i am, but i’d say i’m oversensitive enough to this that i stop writing a wip if it gets too close to my own head bc a) it feels uncomfortable, b) it isn’t as much a push-and-pull for me if i’m just pulling freely from my own head and c) i don’t want to lose characterization to personal experience or bias talking. not that there isn’t overlap bc ofc some characters are more similar to me, but overall i like to choose aus &amp; settings that i’ve never experienced firsthand to make double sure, among other reasons.<br><br>with that said, i think “analyze” is a rly cerebral term and i just really don’t think i’m a smart writer? so i’d maybe say i go by luck &amp; intuition instead? since i don’t have the brain power for any kind of outlining or pre-writing, i basically do the equivalent of starting a scene with one aspect of how i understand a character then kinda just continuing with how that understanding might change/expand. on a doc, that looks like: i plop them somewhere i think might be cute — the afternoon before a wedding, summer in a city, a small island — or with people i wanna see them with — the zenin support group bistro breakfast, gojo at yuuji’s skatepark — and try a little bit of introspection/dialogue (which i guess counts as analyses sometimes, since i also think i write a lot of aus bc they’re excuses for character studies) and just let things unfold from there. <br><br>i Was worried i did project for the haibara scene, but in retrospect, i can guarantee that while i used one specific therapist of mine as a ref for the tone/flow of the dialogue, the actual convo i had with them is nothing like the one yuuji has. so. anyway. to more directly answer your first q: no projection in fic, ever. i think it’s flattering in its own way when people think i do, but it’s incredibly nice of you to ask 😊<br><br>and for the follow up qs: yes! i usually start writing a scene with a single piece of dialogue and/or with a vague who &amp; where, and a lot of that does come down to how they would react in the fragmentary setting i have in my head, who would fit best with who based on what i need (e.g. switching gojo &amp; getou for yuuji &amp; megumi in chs 5 + 6 of flls), or what changes if i shuffle people around, etc.</div>

 <div class=reply>okay can i just say, minus the update this is literally, beat by beat, my morning routine too. down to ordering food. i am toasting my 3pm coffee to you. <br><br>but that aside, i just want to highlight how you saying “get very Hurt and then very Healed” had me on the verge of tearing up for reasons i don’t want to unpack. something about being trusted to provide healing no matter where the story might go before the end. so. thank You. for reading, for thinking of my au as a little haven, for leaving this cc. all my love back to you and i wish you a good week and more ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>Ahhhhh thank you so much for answering! <br><br>So my thoughts about the first tdt book, I enjoyed it but it was still not what I wanted? Like, I just couldn't get into the new characters? They are interesting and all but I kinda went into it expecting to see more of the old characters that I already know and love? But that's on me definitely. It's an interesting story all in all and definitely worth the read and I've already preordered the second book but still I expected more from it? If you care about the lynch brothers I think you'll definitely enjoy it. Also it didn't have enough Adam in it, it needed way more Adam. As you said he is a life changing character and tbh he was what I was most excited about in tdt. Not the best review I know but words are hard for me. But still! I recommend it? If you do end up reading it please tell us what you think! <br><br>I read trc in under 3 days and then I reread it the next week and reread it again the week after so yeah I get a bit crazy rereading what I love and flls? I adored it! I loved it to pieces and I'm definitely rereading it many more times! Wishing you the bestest of days/nights!!</div>

 <div class=reply>no no this is great !! i don’t follow plot well at all with a series like trc/tdt, so i also tend to focus on whether i’m getting into the characters and this told me a lot of what i’d like to know !! i was hoping for at least cameos from blue, gansey and henry, but i know there are two more books and it’s best to save stuff like that for the final bits but -- not enough adam, either? :( i’ll definitely get into it bc the dreaming is one of my favourite parts of trc’s ~lore + i’ve always been curious about declan. so. i’ll try to get the first book read before the next one is released in may!<br><br>THREE DAYS OH GOD THAT’S AMAZING i think trc might have been the last time i read and reread a book series in a genuine craze so i’m really glad you found flls worth loving and rereading in the same vein, thank you so, so much.</div>

 <div class=reply>THE HANDSHAKE EMOJI ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH YOUR FRIEND LIKING THE SAME PERSON IS SENDING ME TO OUTER SPACE AND I’M NOT EVEN SURE WHY. I. BUT THAT’S GOOD. SOLIDARITY IS GOOD. BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE. I AM GLAD. YES? also hello? spontaneous combustion? excuse? me? is this just something that happens? <br><br>(I KNOW IT’S WEAK. I KNOW IT’S EMBARRASSING. i was walking out in ice in house slippers to get the mail just last month; anything above 0 degrees and i are Not friends and we will never be. so cheers to your friend, i would too in 2 degrees.) <br><br>AND SEE YES EXACTLY THAT’S THE THING. i think a lot about how terrible their world had to have been for d--th to be a sanctuary. and oh my god i recently marathon-watched a bunch of r&amp;js in preparation for a new production i’m looking forward to and i’ve always kinda just laughed off the baz lurhamnn one but it’s actually? such a fair adaptation in most parts? or at least i thought. in terms of youth and sacrifice and the price of tenderness in a world so full of blood and fighting and hatred. and it hammered in for me how tender their love was, how full of promise and light they were for each other. like i Knew, but this time i was just particularly gutted by how much romeo resisted all of it, how much of a lover he was until he couldn’t be anymore, and that was the turning point for how everything had became doomed to tragedy. that ruins me. i always wanna be like “okay, but does there have to be a reason every blue curtain is blue for a reason? maybe the author just liked blue” when it comes to reading into ✨ literature ✨ bc Yawn but there is a lot of frustration whenever people dismiss r&amp;j. i love it a lot as well, for a multitude of reasons that aren’t often scratched, and i just. come on. look at these children trying to love. look at this world not letting them. look at them choosing an abundance of love even if that meant leaving this world behind. or whatever. anyway. <br><br>and oooh interesting question !! ya isn’t the most packed area for me in terms of books i got into bc everything is a series and that is a lot of commitment but i dabbled in a few ones years ago. like. the lunar chronicles. or six of crows. the raven cycle is also one of my favourite things of all time (that’s a nuanced statement, but it’s just overall near and dear to my heart.) mostly, i’m a slice of life person and that applies to ya too so my big ya authors are ones like sarah dessen (i know i know white heterosexual american suburbia i’m sorry) &amp; melina marchetta ✌🏼<br><br>T-SHIRT CANNON BLASTING OH MY GOD thank you i have received the vibes rolled up like freebie shirts and am now throwing them back with my pitching arm 🌟 thank you zi, i hope things are also well with you 💛</div>

 <div class=reply>OH MY GOD Y E A H IT WAS LIKE. MY ONE PERSONALITY TRAIT FOR A GOOD COUPLE OF YEARS. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. i cannot overemphasize how much trc occupied my heart, but also like — can i tell you the nitty-gritty details of the plot? probably not. can i quote every single scene that matters to me? absolutely. i just don’t think anything has been able to take its specific place, even beyond the ya space. it just hits That One Spot. <br><br>but no ahhh i actually haven’t read the first tdt book. (what do you think about it? if you’re comfortable sharing) i read the snippet when it first came out, but not the actual book yet. i should do that soon. i don’t know why i haven’t. <br><br>but re: trc alone, bllb is my favourite! it was life changing at the time i first read it. or. adam was life changing when i first read trc. i’m sure he still would be if i read tdt. truly one of my top favourite characters of all time, if not The favourite. so literally any of his arc-defining moments is a favourite part for me. everything from the cabeswater sacrifice to the last scene with his father in trk. and this should go without saying probably but my heart belongs to any scene with the entire gang, henry included, and anything with any platonic dynamic beyond the two gansey/blue &amp; adam/ronan romantic pillars -- so blue &amp; noah, blue &amp; ronan, adam &amp; gansey, ronan &amp; gansey, that one excursion with adam &amp; noah &amp; blue, etc.<br><br>sometimes i think i’m over trc then i remember adam’s introspection, or something like, “she felt one thousand years old. she also felt like maybe she was a condescending brat. she wanted her friends, who were also one-thousand-year-old condescending brats. she wanted to live in a world where she was surrounded by one-thousand-year-old condescending brats.” and it’s like (long, pitched, drawn out scream)<br><br>anyway thank you so much for this q and for reading my jjk fics ❤️ also like ?? three times ?? flls ???????? the whole 89k ???? you’re amazing what the hell</div>

 <div class=reply>this was so strange to receive bc i think hq is genuinely one of those phases i had where whenever i get asked about it i just. smoke a pipe and say Do Not Cite The Deep Magic To Me, Witch, I Was There When It Was Written. i was in hq ~fandom in like 2014 just before the anime started airing, then back again in 2020 when the manga was ending etc etc it got weirdly poetic and personal in that so anyway i digress yes i have watched / read / haisute’d / briefly had a podcast’d / considered doing a newsletter one time’d hq 🧍🏻‍♀️<br><br>which is not to say i don’t appreciate this question !! i do very much !! everyone seems to be traumatized from hqtwt (which i luckily didn’t experience post 2015) and i always try to politely tiptoe around talking abt it outright bc — bc idk. so no, this is nice. this is good. my top three characters on a personal “their narrative arcs have made me cry” level are hinata &gt; oikawa &gt; kita, but if we’re talking abt philosophies &amp; backstories i think hirugami and tsukishima will be on the list somewhere, too. but i have a lot of love for hq’s storytelling, so this is by no means a rigid, exhaustive list. most everyone’s handled great, and it’s just. so hard to pick favourites when it’s not in the heat of hyperfixation, i guess. as for pairings, i’m not !!! abt any ones in particular rn but ones i’ve written for are kghn, iwaoi &amp; more recently atshn, and i’ll always have a soft spot for them all. if i were to write hq now -- i likely won’t, but if i were -- i think i’d like to get into the pairings that came up more between 2015 and 2020, so literally anything that involves characters from matches post-shiratorizawa all the way to the timeskip. maybe. wow, this unlocked a very careful corner of my mind that still has so much affection for hq.</div>

 <div class=reply>i woke up to this at like 1pm all groggy and thought i imagined it oh my god this is so nice. thank you so, so much. i’m a little at a loss for how to thank you properly. but please have all my thank yous &amp; i hope you have a nice day as well 🌟<br><br>as for your questions hmmm it’s hard to think abt previous / other fandoms bc i can’t manage more than one at a time and i’m not the most cultured person to begin with but. i do think itfs will make it to the top ten list even long after my jjk phase is over. i’ll also always have a soft spot for adam &amp; ronan from the raven cycle, bc smth smth letting yourself love and be loved after so much trauma. and i’m not exclusively diehard abt any one hq pairing but there was a time that i couldn’t shut up abt how much all the implications in atshn means to me (and i still think abt them a lot these days even though i don’t consume hq anymore.) <br><br>as for favourite fics on ao3, the first two fics to come to mind are kick at the darkness by ilgaksu (which i’m currently rereading and ahhh i have so much love for their writing, in style and the amount of research and world-building and the chemistry they build for the characters and just. this is The historical au of my dreams) and presque vu by rageprufrock (i still don’t know how i found this fic but it does so much. i read it without having seen the source material and it made the viewing experience so odd for me when i finally did but again. writing style makes me want to live inside the world. and i’m always a sucker for relationship dynamics tainted with grief.) i know none of these answers are relevant to the fic stuff i’m currently doing but. when something stays with you, it stays with you, i suppose. thank you for these qs ❣️</div>

 <div class=reply>YES. but not like. a particularly critical consumer. i know very little about music. i have a vague internal list of which musicals or songs i especially like and which ones i don’t really vibe with as much for a multitude of reasons, but ultimately i have the most undiscerning sense when it comes to anything that remotely bops and will give probably literally anything a shot 😔</div>

 <div class=reply>FERVENT BLOOD DEMON OLDER BROTHER W REALLY CUTE BUNS. this is the only acceptable way of describing choso from now on. the power of being the weary but dedicated eldest sibling… he understands. <br><br>THE STRENGTH YOU HAVE IN FINDING THIS DYNAMIC FUNNY AND CHILL. not to be that person but i remember being in a v similar situation while younger me was still figuring things out and just overthinking everything whenever we would call each other babe or whatever. my mouth is opening in a soundless scream just thinking about it oh my god. anyway. “and them being RIGHT” please i was out for a walk when i read this and the sound i made. in another life, huh. felt that. stay strong. take care of your 12 kids and 2 houses and 200 cows and many, many potatoes. <br><br>AND SDJSKS (yes you can call me sha thank you for asking) IM TELLING YOU IT’S NOT GREAT it’s 13 degrees out today and i had to go grab some takeout food and i made it three steps out the door before i was peeling off my jacket. <br><br>i really think i will as well! i did buy the first volume but haven’t had the time to read bc i’m Swamped but how can i not be excited for personal and care-filled ahhhh it’s giving me barakamon / san-gatsu no lion / showa genroku rakugo shinju kinda vibes (all of which idk if you’ve given a shot, or if you’ll like them, but i do hold them close enough to heart to rec them indiscriminately) <br><br>IM GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP R&amp;J BC I’VE BEEN DYING TO TALK ABT IT FOR A HOT SEC. I’VE BEEN MESSAGING SOMEONE MADLY ABT IT FOR THE PAST MONTH BC IT CAME UP WHILE WE WERE TALKING ABT JJK AND YES YES YES EXACTLY oooh this is making me giddy. it is definitely abt the victims! or rather, to me, it’s abt how two kids had to 💀 instead of being allowed to keep their love, however stupid or shallow someone might think it to be (which i personally don’t) bc their world is so rife with hate. r&amp;j reads like a beautiful romantic story of two kids defying this hatred that no one even knows the source of anymore until tybalt offs mercutio, and that’s where the tragedy is, bc they can’t be together in the kind of verona they were born in and it !! ruins !! me !! i also think r&amp;j is shakespeare at his most beautiful. and just. i really, really love it. <br><br>i wish you a lovely rest of your weekend &amp; the week after. hang in there and take care of yourself ✌🏼🤍✨</div>

 <div class=question>i reread chapter 5 of flls today and iirc you wrote the skate park scene and depicted yuuta the way you did even after the current arc started, so i was wondering where you stand on him right now? bc i thought you wrote him with affection? or if that’s just something you did for the au kinda like with toji?</div>

 <div class=reply>no yeah i think it’s fair to call it affection! i don’t know how you wanted me to approach the part about where i stand on him (and feel free to ask follow up qs if me saying the least rn isn’t what you were going for) but i actually quite like yuuta! i’ve been on record in dms saying i love him, but etc etc that’s prob smth to more critically unpack as we actually get more of him in the main series etc etc<br><br>i was pretty determined to remain an anime-only for jjk until i gave volume 0 a shot — and someone else brought up a bit ago that you can kinda see which themes i like most about jjk in how i wrote h&amp;w, and now that i think about it i can credit nearly all of it to yuuta’s vol 0 arc and character — so rn my attachment to yuuta, if you wanna attempt depth on it, is a mix of those themes and, if you don't, then i really just superficially love his character design <br><br>also, him being in flls was honestly just me shamelessly wanting to see more of him vibing with yuuji, if only for one exchange. i think it’s a fun dynamic despite all the stuff in the current arc (that i'm not even particularly buying into, but who ever knows anymore) 😔</div>

 <div class=question>here to give a shoutout to haibara and the subtle hint at the yuuta-rika-toge trio in flls. one is so wiSE and the other feels like expanding cotton candy to me it's so sOFt. also wondering if you had a specific reason for making haibara the therapist (i.e. as opposed to ijichi or yuki or akari)? i'm guessing it's partly based on his relationship with nanami but i really appreciate the choice - the feeling of imagining post-teen haibara is v gentle and bittersweet.<br><br>also the scene where megumi told yuuji about his dream, which i assume is a reference to the parallel canonverse. i just gotta- *hold one hand up and breathes* sha u got us GoOD my heart is in tatters and i'm COMING bACK FOR MORe.</div>

 <div class=reply>THIS MADE ME SMILE SO WIDE I’M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHY BUT I’M ALWAYS SO ✨✨✨ ABT SEEING THE LITTLE THINGS IN FLLS MENTIONED SO TYSM <br><br>and this is a really great point! huh. i guess — in one early version of flls, it was actually nanami i intended for what ends up being haibara’s ~narrative role, but only in the context of being the sort of legal/social guy that took care of yuuji’s things when his grandpa passed away while he was still in hs. and bc that version was only from megumi’s pov, it was a more distant thing and kinda just worked bc nanami &amp; yuuji’s dynamic in flls (i think) speaks for itself from how megumi sees them. but then i tried actually writing yuuji’s perspective and his first scene ended up being with nanami, and i found that they were a little too close and emotionally connected on a personal level to be a therapy-client rs. they loved each other too much to have the distance necessary. so ijichi actually was one of the first options to come to mind, but at the time i was feeling a lot about gojo &amp; nanami’s convo in one of the light novels and it got me thinking about who nanami would entrust with yuuji in a similar vein. like, there’s no way flls!yuuji would willingly seek out therapy with the ch 3 view he had of himself, i felt, and it became a question of who would nanami entrust with yuuji, at this point in his adult life, the way gojo entrusted him with yuuji. and the only answer was haibara. <br><br>part of it was also that i just jumped on the — like you said — bittersweet chance to take this bright, enthusiastic version of haibara we see in canon and think about how he would have mellowed out in adulthood after the sunny teenage years he was allowed in this universe. (he’s still a pretty bright guy outside of work, though, in the deleted scenes i wrote of him interacting with yuuji beyond therapy.) but anyway i just couldn’t let go once i had haibara locked in, but i did think, since you mentioned her, that akari would have been a better choice in terms of how yuuji needed to be spoken to in that scene.<br><br>also Please i threw in yuuta-rika-inumaki in there to liven up the skatepark and played myself a little with how attached i unexpectedly became. it got to a point where i started thinking about what their home life was like, the three of them, before i snapped out of it. <br><br>and y e s it was a not so subtle reference to canonverse !! i was writing an abandoned itfs wip at the time where one of the lines was smth like “i’ll find you and love you in every universe” and decided to slap a lil reference on there for myself<br><br>thank you so so much for catching all these, it really makes me the human embodiment of an exclamation point 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>it’s available in a lot of places like i just checked and i think b&amp;n/amazon have it? a thousand beginnings and endings by ellen oh if u missed the name 👍👌👌 also. a YEAR. GEGE. THAT'S CRIMINAL. GEGE WYD. also GODD THE NANAMI THING KILLED ME i wanted to cry like king please! please! don’t be like that!!<br><br>and yah i’m in the last yr of my o levels rn so: started hs freshman yr w 11 subjects; my school has the cambridge officiated exams for 3 of them that very year. then we take the CIEs for the remaining 8 subjects end of sophomore year, which is where i am rn 😭 and each of my subjects have 2-3 papers. so i’m in the middle of my mocks rn and. yeah. 18 papers in one exam season 😌 we love to see it. the worst of it is over tho! i only have 2 bio &amp; 2 physics papers left next week &amp; 1 (4 hr help) art session so we chilling. the actual CIEs are april-july so there’ll be more of a respite than this hell month hopefully. and YEAH pomegranates &amp; tattoos n stuff like that make me so happy i dunno i go !! just looking at them its so funny!! like! i see them and i’m like OHHH I LOVE YOU *gets emotional* it’s the same with piercings tbh its genuinely embarrassing,,, i teared up when my crush first sent me a selfie and she had lip/nose rings i was like *bursts into tears* THAT'S SO COOL . i keep telling her “no homo but i’m swooning @ ur piercings” it kills me. i’m three clowns in a trench coat.<br><br>but i’m going crazy HOW did you BUILD A KEYBOARD,, bruh hello? just casually 😭 yo that’s hella cool though!! &amp; no thoughts head empty is valid it’s a real vibe rn. mood. and its ok 🤝 i’ve lived in the humidest hot desert place for my entire life and i still chicken out at higher than moderate temperatures JDFHD,, and yeesh i get u the other day i was watching some old documentary w my dad and people kept like half hugging each other as a greeting and i was physically recoiling like... hello 😨.. maam wait a second. the cognitive dissonance is really so wild. god, it’s been a year.<br><br>unrelated but i started/finished what’s maybe probably my favourite manga ever its fairly short rn and so like. healing &lt;3&lt;3 god if you ever find time in the future take a look at blue period. it’s so horribly amazingly cathartic—like, esp as an artist and just a creative going thru burnout ,, sometimes i’d have to pause for a moment and go like, wait a sec this is LITERALLY me and i didn’t know i was doing xyz before i read this. it’s insanely good. <br><br>and gosh dw i take my time and it really is no obligation—hell, writing these is decompressing for me; it’s genuinely such a highlight of my week getting to sit down &amp; write a little about whatever, so thank you for that! and also thank u so much for the concern 🥺 i really appreciate it (actually same goes for you omg i send so many of these. please feel free to take ur time answering, i really don't mind &lt;33) i hope you have a lovely week!! - 🧚🏽‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>oh god what am i doing i went to add it to my notes and it’s already there and i Know i must have added it when you first brought up — but i didn’t have the author / editor name so here we go. will definitely pick a copy up. and Please i don’t know why i didn’t get into jjk when it was finished. like if i had to get into smth this constantly tragic, why did it have to be the one i have to wait agonizing week by agonizing week for. <br><br>18 PAPERS IN ONE EXAM SEASON I AM FAINT and okay, okay, glad to hear the worst has passed; all the salutes to you for working so hard and enduring... god, what are they doing to y’all. ALSO I GET THAT maybe not about pomegranates, exactly, bc i have yet to interact with one irl, but tattoos and piercings and a bunch of small things that make me inexplicably happy… yes. i understand. IM LAUGHING you: my crush. also you: no homo 😌 but no no i’ve been there &amp; i respect that so much, all three clowns in the trench coat are super super valid<br><br>AND NO I PROMISE IT IS VERY CASUAL i just bought the necessary parts and kinda just youtube + reddit-ed my way through figuring out how they go together. it was very therapeutic — kinda like building ikea furniture, in the sense that the parts did the bulk of the work and i just had to tetris my way through. but thank you for thinking it’s cool! def felt like it! AND OKAY that’s totally understandable omg the summer mean temperature gets to, like, the 30s over there, doesn’t it? i would Unalive on the spot. i melt in 15 degrees so much, Much respect. and please my friend read one of my old bnha fics the other day and she was like, “i can’t get over how impossible this is in a covid world.” and yeah, god, it Has been a year. what a dystopian thing to say. <br><br>I’VE HEARD ABOUT BLUE PERIOD FROM SOMEONE ON MY TL AND HAVE BEEN MEANING TO CHECK IT OUT but i had no idea its themes were like art-related / art-adjacent. i don’t know what i was conflating it with, thinking it’s shoujo. but yeah i’m reading over the premise now and it feels very reminiscent of stuff i’ve loved consuming so zooming over later to the bookstore bc they have the first volume and i think i’d appreciate a physical copy<br><br>and oh that is so so sweet :( it’s the same for me !! thank you for checking in but rest assured these are always so welcome !! lastly, i know you said the worst is over but two papers for bio &amp; physics each still sound like a lot on top of a four hr art session so please take it easy beyond these, take care of yourself, and as always, i’m sending you a multitude of vibes ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>YEAH SO i just finished my rewatch last night and the answer is very easily ep 10. like. no hesitation, no competition. part of it is the chaos in yoi giving us nine eps from the perspective of an anxiety-ridden unreliable narrator and then 💥 an introspective victor-centric ep. <br><br>the banquet reveal is fun yes yes but i also just love victor’s perspective in general, not even bc we got it so rarely outside of this ep but bc he’s so… ruminative. this ep felt so long and packed ?? you start with him in a pool reflecting on his two Ls, then you get his input on all the skaters present in barcelona as well as his perspective on the role he’s occupied for younger skaters so far in his career + what his departure from the sport to coach yuuri means for them and himself in terms of motivation &amp; growth. you also get two of my favourite scenes in all of yoi: a) victor’s observant internal monologue as he watches yuuri search for a gift, so full of attention and so telling in terms of how he handles the things he understands abt other people, and b) that perfect, perfect scene by the sea and the way the ring glints in the sunlight + the expression we see victor make when yurio kinda crosses a line in talking shit abt yuuri and their rs. there’s just so much meat there, not to mention the absolute chef’s kiss exchange where yurio stops as he’s walking away and goes, “this place reminds me of hasetsu’s ocean.” and victor kinda smiles and says, with so much fondness and wistfulness, that he was thinking the same thing goddddd <br><br>for standalone scenes, i also love the parking lot argument in ep 7, just bc i think there’s so much great characterization there and a lot to be said abt their relationship overall + the walk back to the rink after that, with the latter half of tales of a sleeping prince playing in the background, which is just. poetic cinema.</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh yeah it’s not as deep or special as i prob made it sound, but i was watching this sally rooney panel last december &amp; she said she can’t really conceive of character separately from dynamic. so i started thinking abt this in the context of the two novels she has out, and it just made me realize how… untested an approach it was for me? nearly all the stuff i’ve written before flls has been very character-centric; it’s very internal &amp; introspective from the first line, and in retrospect, the rs in the fic tends to yield to how i am characterizing whoever has the main pov of the story. i think it’s most obvious w victor in ltmmly, who in a sense feels the most isolated in terms of all my narrators, but the same thing remains true with, like, bakugou from 2 A.M. or deku from wdct or yuuri from dtl, who all have these dynamics going on outside the main romantic storyline yet they all still serve the character first and foremost. in all my fics (and even the whatevers i’ve written beyond these), everything is established through one narrator’s internal characterization, no matter what external elements affects them, and so whatever relationships are in the story tend to be extensions of this. <br><br>by the time i watched the sally rooney panel, i already had one context-less scene for flls, which was initially supposed to be from megumi’s pov alone, and i figured i might as well try writing this one scene into smth where the rs was at the forefront of characterization. smth where the characters wouldn’t be characterized as they are if not for the rs we’re seeing them in. somehow that ended up meaning i’ll have two characters who are in an established rs of some sort bc i’m lazy and subconsciously didn’t wanna build my usual rs from scratch just for a writing experiment — past me didn’t know yet that this ✨ experiment ✨ would breach 100k — and that i’ll also write the same rs from two separate perspectives. neither of which i’ve ever... done... before…? i guess ymo counts in terms of alternating povs, but tdrk and momo had diff narratives going on. so. i didn’t know what flls was gonna be when i started writing it, but i knew i wanted it to be abt this one rs and the two people in it, and i wanted to get to know these characters through the things i learn abt them as i write their rs — and for the most part, i want to believe that’s how it went, though i really didn’t expect flls!yuuji to be what he ended up being.</div>

 <div class=question>Whenever I read something you've written I'm always like woooow emotions!! You remember those?? Your writing just make me _feel_ !! I just fjskdkjfjshajf idkkkk!! I've read and reread most of your works multiple times and I'm always looking forward to reading more from you I just fjskdjjfjs I wish I had the words to express how much I enjoy your writing. Anywaysss Qs!! First of all, how are? Hope you are having a lovely day/night! Would you ever consider writing about Gojo/Geto before the events of flls? What are Miminana's thoughts about Gojo over the years? How was it being raised by Geto when he was so young? They don't seem to be that close with Megumi but are they closer to Tsumiki? Oh! And having sukuna as a cat is an amazing idea!! How did yuuji find him? Stay safe!! 💙💙</div>

 <div class=reply>"YOU REMEMBER THOSE" PLEASE tysm for reading, ty even more for rereading, &amp; ty most for looking forward to the stuff i churn out !! i’m doing okay !! busy w life, but that’s a joy and privilege in itself. i hope you’re also having a lovely day/night ❤️<br><br>in an ideal world, there’ll be a stsg prequel to flls &amp; a nbmk sequel set between ch 6 + 7, but i’m still not sure if i trust myself with writing either one? esp pre-flls stsg, whose story feels much bigger than all the one-on-one stuff that itfs has in flls. but it’s def smth i’m considering and smth i’d wanna do. <br><br>as for miminana, i think that despite his youth, getou’s guardianship is more explicitly paternal in practice than gojo’s w megumi (&amp; tsumiki). whereas the fushiguros were more self-sufficient &amp; gojo’s main responsibility was to keep them fed, funded &amp; out of trouble in the actual legal parent’s absence, getou Was the parent for miminana, which would’ve involved a lot of trial and error on his part. he’s, what, freshly dropped out of college and has to prob be in charge of homeschooling the girls for a bit on top of everything else? the girls wouldn’t have minded, i think; if anything, they were more self-sufficient than i imagine getou realized in the early years, always mindful of not inconveniencing him, even if it means sweeping it under the rug when nanako gets in trouble. (getou finds out anyway.) i like to think it was all chaotic for a time, though the girls were attached &amp; happy to have getou, but there must’ve been some relief when they moved to the yushima house with this implicit understanding that they’ll be settling here for a bit. in my head, there’s this scene of getou hesitating abt moving to tokyo — but tsumiki happens to drop by &amp; clicks well with miminana, &amp; that’s enough for getou to deprioritize his issues with gojo bc this is the girls’ chance to have more typical teenage years around someone their age.<br><br>with that in mind, the girls are very close to tsumiki! i hate that i didn’t get to write them more having a field day being bridesmaids. they’re less close to megumi just bc he’s a bit younger than them &amp; not the easiest to get to know, but there’s def a lot of fondness &amp; protectiveness there, even if nanako won’t admit that was her motivation for reaching out to yuuji. she’s prickly around megumi in the beginning bc she’s defensive around anyone she thinks might be looking down at her (megumi wasn’t. he was just sleepy and didn’t care.), but that just became their default bc she doesn’t really get to bicker with anyone else in the family. megumi’s more comfortable letting his guard down around mimiko and ok ok running out of space: there’s a lot of tension in the beginning bw the girls and gojo bc it felt a lot like seeing living proof of the Before Getou &amp; After Getou in each other, though they eventually (and stiltedly) find reconciliation between that. and sukuna is actually a foster cat!</div>

 <div class=reply>short answer is here and where you are, by virtue of its premise alone. i don’t really write canon unless i need to soften smth up for myself — and h&amp;w happens to be an antithesis of sorts.<br><br>the long, rambling preface of an answer (that you don’t need to read; i’m just talking to myself) is that there’s been so much whiplash in going from my twee bnha / yoi days to jjk, where i feel like i accidentally ended up seeming like such a sadistic writer when that’s never been my intention shjshs i just. have a complicated rs with the term angst &amp; the connotations it has for me, mostly bc i associate it with writing sad things For The Sake of hurting readers with a thing everyone just knows is sad. of which i did a lot in high school, writing inherently angsty things like mcd or unrequited love or whatever purely bc that’s what everyone was doing at the time, and i resent the practice now. not on other people — i gobble up angsty romance — but angst for the sake of angst is smth i actively try to avoid in my own writing these days bc, among many other reasons, it feels like regression for myself to equate tragedy with emotion in writing like i did as a teenager. i think there are so many other ways to get emotion out of readers than just going for the inherently ~angsty stuff like d—th. so a lot of the time i’m surprised to see that the things people label as angsty in my fics are stuff that i believe to be inevitable in terms of where story arcs go (and not smth i’m just writing bc i’m in the mood to make someone cry.) someone has to leave, someone has to make a choice in a moment of realization, and i know these moments prob count as angst bc they’re far from fluff — but anyway. my tone kinda got beyond me, but this isn’t meant to be criticism for anything or anyone at so much that, in answering ur q, i wanna make it clear i’m not sure how to define angst for myself? i’d still say that among the cityboys fics, h&amp;w is the angstiest by trope standards, but also that flls has been the saddest to me so far bc — to borrow the words of a comment that left me staring at the ceiling yesterday — it’s this simple tragedy of being two separate people. and i think “i will” embodies flls more than the actual mitski song it’s titled after, but there’s a lot i find sad in being this “tall child” in an ostensibly grown-up rs. you can try to love this person with all you have + with maturity in mind, but the end of the day you are a product of ur childhood, and that’s not smth you get to shake off easily just bc u love someone &amp; they love u back. so.</div>

 <div class=reply>it wasn’t so much a convo i was having as it was a convo i was lucky to be around to hear, but a couple days ago i was moderating this discussion bw two people who run storytelling workshops and there was a point where storyteller # 1 started talking abt a friend who video calls her grandmother everyday without fail since lockdown started — and bc the grandma’s memory and lucidity aren’t as good as they used to be, what ends up happening is that they have a lot of the exact same conversations, over and over again, in these daily calls. and storyteller # 2 from the discussion said smth along the lines of “it takes a lot of love to keep asking questions you already know the answer to” and that really? hit me? at the time? bc like. from my perspective, i’ve seen a lot of importance placed on how good convos are good bc they’re of really great significance or substance. in relationships, too, i’ve always thought connection is forged best through the ability to have long talks or whatever. and i still do believe that deep discussions can and do serve as foundation for equally deep relationships (like linklater’s before trilogy, for example, where the portrayal of love is All in the conversation) — but there is a lot for me to appreciate as well in what person b said in that discussion. bc it’s so true. how much love you must have for a person to be content just being in conversation with them, just listening to them talk, just hearing their voice, not caring if you’re asking the same questions and getting the same answers. like there’s so much to be said abt words of affirmation as a powerful tool for expressing your love for someone, and on the flipside of that is just this contentment to listen not even for the sake of the act of listening but just bc there’s so much closeness in any kind of conversation with someone… i guess. idk. this is the first time i’m articulating my thoughts from that discussion so thank you for your this super lovely q 🤍</div>

 <div class=question>i remember finding you through your honeymoon yoi fic and reading everything you wrote and now that i can finally read your jjk fics the thing that rly gets me about your writing is how tenderly you write about love ❤️ you make me feel like i want to be in love or like i’m the one in love and i think that’s rly interesting bc looking back you write about so many different kinds of relationships and i would even say that first love late spring is your most layered one so far but alongside lie to make me like you it’s also the one that has made me feel the most like i’m in a relationship with someone i’ll love forever and i want to make it work no matter what which feels very adult while your bnha fics feel innocent gentle and young so i guess my question is has your mindset about relationships changed over the years in a way that is reflected in your fics ?</div>

 <div class=reply>oh whew okay wow. this had the brain cells firing. first of all, thank you for reading Everything over however many years. that's straight up astounding to me. thank you so, so much for reading and for talking so kindly abt my writing. <br><br>with that said, i can’t say i’ve put too much thought abt how my portrayal of love &amp; relationships has changed over the years, necessarily, though i Have thought abt how flls has been this deviation, for lack of a better word rn, from the love i used to write? but for a diff reason than ltmmly was. all the bnha fics get to be small-scale &amp; gentle bc the lives at the centre of these stories Are small-scale &amp; that’s reflected in the relationships that come out of those lives. but w ltmmly, the sudden adult-ness came from the fact that i was suddenly writing the pov of a 27-year-old man who’s coming to terms with a worldview &amp; a career that he’s had for a lifetime. there’s More to consider in building a rs, not to mention i had to do smth w all the canon layers that yuuri &amp; victor both had. so for ltmmly, i think it was just the source material doing what it does. whereas with flls, all i wanted was to try a story that was rs &gt; character and not my usual character &gt; rs tendency. somehow we ended up with 90k+ of some of the same “themes” ltmmly scratched, except we’ve got two much younger characters who haven’t yet figured out how to be themselves, much less be another person’s. so i actually won’t say flls feels adult in that sense, bc at the end of the day, i think flls yuuji &amp; megumi loved each other with intensity that they were a bit too young for in so many ways, but i very much appreciate you calling it layered, and i can see why it would feel more adult from my end. <br><br>to answer your q, though, idt my mindset abt romantic relationships has changed over the years, exactly. i think i’ve always been deadset on the kind of love i wanna write abt in that i want it to be tender &amp; compassionate &amp; with as much necessary complexity as i can give them etc etc so i think what’s changed instead is my approach to what that compassion &amp; complexity entails. bc compassion &amp; complexity for victor meant writing abt him failing in relationships as an extension of how i understood his canon characterization, yet compassion &amp; complexity for itafushi in a small-scale college au somehow ended up involving how love languages are at times reflections of unresolved trauma and how that might. y’know. make relationships difficult, among many other things. i’m not sure how it ended up that way, but it did, and all i know ahead of the last ch is that (if i’m right in reading the question within your question) i’m not more pessismistic abt writing love than i used to be. i still want to treat flls with the same tenderness i wanted to imbue in the fics that came before them. i still want its characters to have their love.</div>

 <div class=reply>LITTLE AUTHORS NOTES oh no 🥺🥺 it’s like annotating a book before giving it to someone as a gift, except even more personal in a sense in the act of choosing what to retell. that is so sweet, i wish i had access to such an anthology :( <br><br>yo going from hq to jjk has been the wildest whiplash of my life. i’ve just been !!! and ??? abt everything since i got here and i still don’t know how my brain chose this series to hyperfixate on when we’ve been happy so far just indulging in slice of life and the occasional sports anime. “a full speed rollercoaster but on steroids and even akutami has no clue where its going” JHDSJSHJ my personal favourite was akutami being like oh nanami was only supposed to lose an arm or whatever idk what happened — like same i feel them on that front i also don’t know anything when i write but MY GUY YOU ARE WRITING A WEEKLY SERIES. and oh my god Exactly abt nobara…. exactly…….. if the next time we hear of her is to hear her confirmed unalive, i respectfully do not want it. that’s one of your core four, akutami, cmon. also, someone pointed out that it’s been a year since megumi &amp; yuuji have had a chapter together and i’m like cool cool that’s cool <br><br>18 papers. oh dear god. wait, so like… are they 18 papers throughout the year (which is Still an unhinged amount) or 18 papers due within this one exam season. or. how does it work. and more importantly how are u doing. and to shift gears — A N Y KIND OF TATTOOS THAT’S SO, SO COOL OH GOODNESS WORDS OR DOODLES OF STARS I AM MELTING. THAT WILL LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL. and no i have not seen a pomegranate tree in person prior to this cc and i still haven’t but now i have seen it through a screen and o h m y god they’re so pretty? they’re like the Platonic ideal of how i visualize a tree. and the hanging pomegranates themselves are so pretty !! what the hell !! no wonder persephone ate all those pomegranates !! <br><br>as for me, i… have been equally busy and lethargic recently, so really just autopilot, no thoughts head empty. but i decided to build a mechanical keyboard from scratch this past weekend and i’m not mad at the result. more random things in my mind though have been… how strange it is that i grew up in a tropical country but can’t stand warm weather here in canada. or how i’ll never again be able to go to a cinema or the theatre or a concert the same way ever again, if at all. which isn’t the happiest thought but. anyway. tysm for the vibes, and i am sending you So many ones in return 🌟🌈☁️🍄🌼🦋 also idt i’ve said this yet but please please please don’t feel obligated to keep sending these ccs esp with everything going on omg please take care of yourself. i hope you’re finding space to decompress between everything ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>thinking about how "nobara and her boys" is both my favorite thing and the bane of my existence. like if i could pick one phrase to sum the relationship between the first years up it would definitely be that, but there's also a layer of nobara oxford comma and her boys - there's always this degree of separation between her and whatever yuuji and megumi are up to (read: the cursed womb act, or the part at the very end of origin of obedience when she and megumi were talking). idk. it casts a different light on the portrayal of her independence: i think so much of it is also linked to her distance from important people in her life (saori, and then fumi and her hometown, and now yuuji and megumi). in the chair scene after her fight of mahito too, i kept thinking about how much she probably spends crafting and reworking her life philosophies and presenting it to the "audience" around her. she's like an in-between of yuuji and megumi almost - where yuuji is all about protecting and ensuring a good death for everyone and then megumi is very insistent about his own brand of justice, she's just sort of on this stage where she's aware that there's a crowd but there are also specific people that matter more to her. but whereas yuuji and megumi found each other on each end of the spectrum and created this beautiful yin yang circle that's their relationship nobara just kind of stands there in between. there's no "i'll kill you if you die" or "live a long life" specifically directed to her and her alone, and i keep thinking about how lonesome that can get? like how you put it in h&amp;wya, there's nothing for her alone to grieve about when yuuji died, and the same thing might happen if yuuji and megumi switched places, too. at the same time tho her lore is def the least fleshed out out of the three, so idk i guess we just have to see and hold our breath if akutami is going to pull an akutami again. this is just me spilling my brain out but id love to see what you have to say about her!!<br><br>(also thinking about when akutami said out of the trio &amp; gojo either one will live and the other three will die, or one will die and three will live, and thinking about how either scenario will break us just the same. there really wasn't a time when i thought they were going to have like a cheesy shounen happy ending, but this thought just hits me like a truck every time i read something just borderline domestic and not straight up angst. ig it's very poignant to know that between the four of them there won't be any growth without pain &amp; heartbreak and i'm just here like TAKE MY HEART INSTEAD LEAVE THEM ALONEEEEEEEEE)<br><br>also echoing my fellow anons down here- take care of yourself sweet! you deserve all the gourmet pancakes this world have to offer and to think soon it will be SPRINg!!! (and allergies but it's so pretty i am willing to endure)</div>

 <div class=reply>ooooh oxford comma is such a good analogy for this. i sympathize w u saying that it’s both your fav thing n the bane of ur existence; i think there’s smth to be appreciated abt nobara’s specific position re: (vague wave at everything yuuji &amp; megumi have going on) in that she gets to be a bit more objective abt it — or idk if objective is the word i want to use, but i do believe her perspective offers a viewpoint on yuuji &amp; megumi as individuals that the boys prob don’t have of each other just from how life-altering the very foundation of their dynamic is. but at the same time i can’t help but also be :| abt how that viewpoint has been forced on her in a way by virtue of being the one left in between. esp knowing she’s the eldest of the first years now, there’s a lot of burden in those back-to-back convos she had w yuuji &amp; megumi each at the end of origin of obedience. she chooses who she wants to protect just like megumi &amp; she’s certainly not immune to yuuji’s history of barging into the lives of people who thought they were very clear abt who they choose to let in, but she also is able to maintain her distance in cases where megumi and yuuji might be all personal feelings at either end of, like you said, their spectrum. and i admire that abt nobara! she’s not swayed in what being true to herself means to her, even if that self can change and even if that self gets complicated whenever it opens itself up to the people she loves and respects. in that sense, i really love how small-scale nobara’s worldview is, even if it’s bc her world is small by nature / by design. and in her shoes, i won’t envy (waves again at what yuuji &amp; megumi have going on) that, so idk if it’s lonesome, necessarily, bc the boys love and trust her and doesn’t isolate her in their daily lives, but i will say that if the person in question had been someone else but nobara, it would feel a little… helpless? bc there’s a lot less tangible stuff to latch your love onto, and i know that in that position i’d feel very lost. but i think nobara as we know her has cemented kind of a position of watching over yuuji &amp; megumi — and that’s the part that, again, makes me :| bc yuuji &amp; megumi feeling responsible for each other is a lot in itself, but for nobara to be the third point for both of them, whether unconsciously or not, for her to be in a role where she keeps life-or-d//th secrets for megumi while also being a wingwoman for yuuji — that’s so !!! she’s also so realistic yet so determined to exist outside/beyond that realistic-ness sometimes and. idk. i’m running out of space without even articulating anything well but the gist is that i love nobara so much and i really wish akutami has it in them to give us more. <br><br>and ahhh the last part of this cc got me smiling so wide, tysm !! take care of yourself as well &amp; i hope you’re enjoying the pre-spring weather wherever you are in the world ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>NO YEAH SORRY i meant that like. it’s a little :| to academicize folktales. like i understand it’s necessary in terms of canonizing history but also like. makes vague distasteful hand gestures towards western academia. so i feel especially moved by the concept of an anthology compiled with care rather than a clinical eye. bc yeah. exactly. people care about stories so much. more than can perhaps ever be studied.<br><br>15 TO GO? EXCUSE ME? FIFTEEN? FIFTEEN PAPERS? FOR ONE EXAM SEASON? also i’m laughing at the transition from “it’s fine tho” to “i can’t listen to we’ll be fine anymore” skjsjsjs OH NO THANK YOU FOR BEING SO KIND TO FLLS BUT I AM SO SO SORRY. i’ve been listening to it myself so much recently bc it’s a Banger but i admit that whenever the mahogany sessions version comes on i sometimes have to take a sec and just stare into space. it really was the perfect song to write ch 6 to and i’m eternally grateful for you leading me to luz 😔❤️<br><br>this influx of jjk content has been so overwhelming god i was deep in active hq!! fandom twice in my life but not even that felt as quick and urgent as pre-s7 vld with all the shiro stuff. i think there was a point in the last week where i just shut down abt the jjk frenzy and was like “damn i used to live like this?” and then decided to tap out. still trying to figure out where i stand with all this info we got and the fact that we got them at all, but yeah !! it’s a lot !! so much to unpack !! and it’s all still coming !! also i just really miss nobara god Please<br><br>i am hanging in there, thank u sm !! it has been hectic, but i’m not usually the kind of person that gets affected by emotion or stress or any kind of high tension so i’ve just been very ??? and :/ abt this deviation from that usual. i feel like a wifi router that needs to be unplugged bc i can’t troubleshoot what the problem is. but yeah. buzzed out is a good word for it. and dhsjks it’s okay this is a safe space for admitting to deflating to mitski every now &amp; then 😳 your life sounds incredibly buzz-y as well (you have to explain those 15 papers to me bc i—) and i hope u are also finding the time to vibe in between. take care of yourself as much as you can. sending u love n vibes in turn ☀️🤍 and hmm let’s see. what’s smth that’s been on your mind a lot lately? could be jjk or life or a movie or even an earworm of a song?</div>

 <div class=question>thinks about wandavision’s “what is grief if not love persevering” -&gt; huh how can i make this about itfs -&gt; thinks about the period where yuuji “dies” -&gt; thinks about “i’ll kill u if u die again” “guess i cant afford to die now” -&gt; thinks about yuuji’s impending execution -&gt; thinks about yuuji’s on the run and megumi cant find him tho naoya and yuuta can easily find him -&gt; thinks about him running away bc he wants to protect megumi from sukuna and protect his other friends -&gt; thinks about how when naoya said about his execution, yuuji didnt bat an eye but once megumi is mentioned, he’s all “what do u want with fushiguro” -&gt; thinks about how gege said their ending has been decided -&gt; lies down -&gt; takes a deep breath -&gt; screams into the void <br><br>on that note, i think(?) megumi is surrounded by grief. not just towards yuuji, him and all of his connections. idk if he grieved about his parents, but its so apparent with tsumiki. and while he couldnt do anything about tsumiki’s situation, he tries his hardest for yuuji. and even then, he’s still grieving. and since he choose to save ppl, wouldnt he grieve the most, since the ones he choose to save, couldnt be saved? (yuuji in this instance bc of his execution) is he alone bc thats how he is or is he a loner bc of his grief. bc right, how can u grieve if theres nothing to lose? but he gets along with yuuji and nobara and swears to get stronger but he knows, he knows how the path of a sorcerer is always a lonely one. are yuuji and nobara sth of a fresh of breath air for him? regardless yuuji is on borrowed time, regardless anything could happen to nobara. regardless regardless. does he push back his grief into a corner when he’s with the two? allowing himself to be normal as normal gets? he seems like he has A Lot of Love for people he cares about, bc what is grief if it isnt love unspent? though he doesnt show it, or atleast not expressive about it. he loves in his own way, and thats why he grieves. <br><br>wheewww thought too hard there i might snap<br><br>so like thats how my afternoon went 🤪💔 hope ur day is better than mine!</div>

 <div class=reply>I KNOW IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I GOT THIS CC BUT I’M STILL GOBSMACKED TO HAVE TO READ “WHAT IS GRIEF IF NOT LOVE PERSEVERING” IN THIS CONTEXT. ALSO LIKE — YES, I’M FEELING A LOT FROM THIS, BUT I’M SIMULTANEOUSLY SO TICKLED BY YOU LAYING OUT EVERY STEP OF YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS HERE. MY HEART IS CAVING IN BUT I’M SMILING AT THE SAME TIME.<br><br>on a serious note u know in all honesty idt i ever believed yuuji &amp; megumi (or anyone in jjk) will have a traditionally good ending. like i don’t think i’ve ever had any illusions abt them ending the series ~happily. it would be great if they did, but in retrospect that would shock me big time. but emphasis on “traditionally good” !! i’m not the most optimistic as of where we’re at, but some days i do wish for a happy ending for the characters in the sense that it feels… right and complete for them and their arcs? which i often feel is the most we can ask for from jjk. like for example, i have my conflicted thoughts abt nanami’s d—th, but if i wanna be generous abt it, there’s smth i can appreciate abt him spending his last moments with this vision of haibara and with him being able to choose his last words for yuuji. and so. sometimes whenever i think abt jjk ending i’m like ok what would that kind of compromise ending look like for everyone else ? u know ?<br><br>but anyway — wait, oh my god. oh my god, oh my god. sorry. i. i just got to the part where you said what is grief if not love unspent and. oh god. i need a second. why is this so much better and worse than the wandavision one. oh god. my brain just shut down. i. yeah. um. wow. okay. that got me spiraling for a hot sec. no, exactly, i agree. with grief i think there’s an element of just letting it happen To you right? someone’s rs with their grief is as passive as it is primal, i wanna say. but love (to me at least) is a very active thing. the act of loving another person is a choice. it’s caring for someone on purpose. whether it’s wanting to save them or just wanting to make it right for them or choosing to pretend to be normal for a few secs. so once again if the only way you’ve known to love is to also grieve as a result of that love... that’s so emotionally paradoxical. add to that all the moral dilemmas that complicate megumi &amp; yuuji’s rs and just. jeez. <br><br>“wheewww thought too hard there i might snap” DSJSHJSH I FELT THAT<br><br>no no no these are great !! thank u for this cc !! and i hope ur afternoons have been less debilitating since !! ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>hi sha! just dropping by to say that i binged flls and here and where you are in three days, and honestly thank you thank you so much for making these two a reality. i haven't been writing for a while and have been trying to find inspiration to get back in to it, jjk being the first thing i'm so obsessed with after a while; and you just kind of left me awestruck haha. the care that you put into the canonverse (which honestly makes me so *afraid* of writing it now why does akutami have to make our lives so hard), and the way you dissect yuuji and megumi and nobara just kinda makes my heart swell. there's a certain tenderness in the way you write that just *gets me* every time and i'm so thankful for that. i think i've gained more life lessons from flls than i've actually gotten from actual life for a while now. and i think that's all the hallmarks of a good piece of writing, and again thank you for just *vague hand gestures*, just this. <br><br><br>i've always felt such an attachment to them, but i've just realized that i see parts of myself in the three and maybe that's why i'm especially drawn. yuuji and nobara's vulnerability is definitely more striking to me - there's definitely a lot written on megumi and how his background made him guarded, but i do feel that the subtlety in the other two just makes it all the more heartbreaking. you'd expect megumi to be very in his head and kind of brooding about it - it fits his design and of course that's no less painful; but it's especially jarring and painful to see yuuji and nobara behind the scenes, beyond popular-class-clown and strong-confident-woman that's just particularly, ouch, i don't know how to explain it even. it's so raw and honest and tender and it makes me want to at once beat them upside the head and give them a bonecrushing hug and tell them to cry as much as they want to.<br> <br>here's to more from you in the future, in whichever way shape or form because please know i appreciate you Very Much; and here's also to the kids because lord know the manga is breaking my goddamn heart someone PLEASE give yuuji a hug.<br><br>(also i am Very Sorry if this sent multiple times i have no clue how cc works after all)</div>

 <div class=reply>hi hi hi wow wow wow wow. okay. first of all, thank you so so much for reading both of those monsters in such a short span of time !! i’m doing a little reread of flls myself rn and kinda just confronting how it is to read all the chapters in one go and i have a lot of appreciation for u reading all that on top of h&amp;w ❤️<br><br>i completely get the fear of writing canonverse … i don’t write a lot of canon anything myself, and in the case of h&amp;w i was only able to write it bc i didn’t think anyone at all was gonna want to read it + i wasn’t shooting for canon compliance at all so much as i was just building any world that would make the scene n themes i wanna write make sense — so there was a lot more freedom in that? but i deeply understand being hyperaware of this need for care (and i’m very touched that you said this in talking about my fic) and if there’s anything i can say to that end i think sometimes it’s easier to just start with what feels true to you and the jjk characters. i’ve def broken past the point of theorizing abt jjk plot (if my lizard brain was ever even at that point) and for me it’s the characters that hold it all together at the foundation + them that got me to write again after i also haven’t been writing for years. so. yes. i understand and i am very, very much cheering you on. <br><br>god the tenderness with which you describe yuuji &amp; nobara got me good. their dynamic is in my top three of the series, and ur desc reminds me of everything i loved abt that scene at the end of origin of obedience with them walking side by side. their conversation there feels so stripped down to the quietest forms of who they are, for themselves and to each other and — maybe more so with nobara than yuuji — sometimes i gotta just float thru the astral plane abt how hard-earned their current life philosophies kinda are, in a way? it’s not a facade, who they are, and their bts selves aren’t necessarily the realer versions; i think they’re both such genuine people, but in that headstrong approach they both have to the world, i also sometimes think abt how they both have to keep reworking what they believe and how they react to the world around them, and the kind of people this makes them in turn, the stuff they gotta wrestle with to keep being headstrong. not that this isn’t the case for megumi, but like u said, that’s a separate train of thought. idk. i love them all sm, so thank u for sharing your thoughts.<br><br>and ahhh i’m running out of space to thank you properly but again, thank you for reading my fics &amp; taking the time to send me this cc. thank you for your kind, thoughtful words about my writing. thank you for your appreciation. here’s to the kids, yes, but just as much, here’s to you finding inspiration in jjk and getting back to writing 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>nothing too deep or anything like that 😅 somewhere in the back of my head i guess i was just thinking that flls!yuuji has prob never seen yuuta without either inumaki or rika, so he would have been a bit !!! about seeing yuuta alone once the reception gets into full swing. so it’s partly just another slight layer to his rs with aloneness, and, much less pretentiously, also partly that it just made sense that yuuta would have been his first choice to drag with him to the dance floor.</div>

 <div class=question>ohmy gosh yes! ah! omg those are all such amazing and cool points to bring up, and you express them super well! omg. gosh.<br>by involved i mean like. yeah a little of what u were saying in the sense that it keeps changing and he has to deal with new facets of his loss unearthing and everything shifting every so often. megumi has a surprising amount of ties to people which is a cool spin on the loner archetype he seems like at the start of the series, but it’s constantly part of his life/in his face. all of his loss is, for want of a less crude term, so plot significant? it’s so front and centre of anything that progress seems like being sent straight back. <br>and like when you talk about losing people specifically, like. megumi’s the one who's shown to have the least organic circumstances regarding it. so far, we know of nobara’s saori/fumi and yuuji’s grandfather but losing those was more natural and they either had a choice in that or had warning of it? things just keep Happening to megumi. and this is where your agency point comes in bc a lot of the time he really doesn't get the kind of agency/structure he craves and Has craved since childhood, given that his caretakers haven’t necessarily been the most stable - or, at least, structured. and yeah etc etc methods of dealing with grief etc you gave some really cool points abt that. yeah!! idk. it’s interesting hehe</div>

 <div class=reply>no but okay hold on hold on hold on you used so many perfect phrases at so many points here !! are u kidding !! thank u for your kind words abt mine but this is — okay. first off. plot significant. you’re right. absolutely right. i’ve never conceived of it in that specific sense but that is so so true. i won’t say nobara n yuuji’s losses aren’t insignificant to the plot but it’s very true that this connection instead comes out on their character arcs as opposed to like. tsumiki being puppeteered by kamo (evil) or. all of toji and the zenin clan. and “progress seems like being sent straight back” godddd yeah. calling megumi’s losses the least organic of the ones (across the main trio at least) is a really, really, Really good way of putting it imo and i think speaks volumes to how he’s really never conceived of a worldview that wasn’t entrenched in being a sorcerer. which is a ridiculously simplistic way for me to approach it that it’s practically reductive but my brain is fried from this last week and this is the best i have to offer rn. the lack of structure kinda is the structure of megumi’s life and it’s interesting that this has resulted in him being so selective abt his capacity for care. like yeah, he chooses who he wants to protect and feels rational in his reasoning behind that, but he’s also so devoted to the people he does want to keep safe to the point of making some ~irrational choices and promises. so there’s that element to his agency that Does actively defy any neat structuring in turn, and hand in hand with that bit from gege’s interview re his emotions towards his shikigami, it really just shapes how not even grief is exempt from the same thought processes that have him rationalizing that tadashi from the juvenile detention centre is not worth saving bc of what he’s done vs him admitting to what he knows are purely subjective feelings about yuuji. <br><br>but idk. i’m not happy at all with the word choices i used here and i feel like this is a ramble with no structure or no real depth to it but this reply is centuries late and i’m super sorry for that :/ thank you sm for your own wonderful thoughts and i’ll def be thinking more abt megumi’s grief being so snaked into the plot as we move farther into this arc. like. if you take out the parts of megumi that’s been shaped for us by these big plot points, what remains at the core. but also there’s no truly separating plot from character without adjustments to characterization and to act so is like saying megumi’s nothing without plot which is absolutely Not True and it’s a lot of his character-centric choices that drive the story but—you know what i mean. i’m sorry this is my messy thought process in real time skjhjsj much to ruminate on and overall i hope you have a lovely week ahead of you ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>IT WORKS (BUT ALSO IT’S THE EQUIVALENT OF LEAVING SMTH UP TO A HIGHER DIVINITY. WHICH I THINK SPEAKS TO MY GENERAL APPROACH TO THINGS.) in some seriousness tho it’s so valuable to cement in your formative yrs that u can do multiple things in adulthood. whenever i encounter a younger person struggling with what they wanna do in the future, 8 times out of 10, the conflict lies in this internalized certainty that they gotta lock on smth and that to follow one path = leaving another. and ofc that is the case sometimes and some ppl face a lot more obstacles for reasons that go beyond willpower (social, financial, etc.) but idk. it’s a lil claustrophobic to compact your multitudes And all the multitudes in the things you love into One Thing you have to commit to. that’s like. falling in love with a person and expecting them to never change or grow into their own self. ofc you will change. they will change. your rs will change. at the end of the day, understanding and love are all you need to cultivate in that inevitability and i think that’s the same in all the things (for there will be multiple things) you wanna pursue in life, at whatever age or for whatever purposes. tho i guess that’s romanticizing it a bit. life isn’t always so kind as to allow that. but sometimes you have to believe it is. idk. i’m digressing big time. but tysm !! idk about best yet but i think i am living A Life and it’s all i can ask for.<br><br>AND OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD I AM GEEKING OUT ABT THIS ANTHOLOGY !! it’s interesting bc folktales from an anthropological standpoint always take on this v srs academic role. smth historical n cultural. and ofc that remains true with any folktale bc these are literally the backbones of all storytelling, but it tends to eclipse how most folktales are genuinely just really really really cool?? by virtue of many things that’s beneficial when examining culture and representation sure but that’s Such a clinical way of approaching the rawest form of storytelling that we have. so yes going back to what you were saying, that sounds so amazing !!!!!!! not just to collect and curate but also particularly the element of making it fun !! bc yes intentions evolve in weight overtime but the idea of folktales being ~preserved as these fun, community-driven stories that reflect the heart of the people that told these... hell yeah. Hell Yeah. my heart is doing some next level singing. <br><br>and ohhh i hope exams went well !! and yeah !! subbers have been getting to translating the jjk audio dramas (which are essentially just extended mini stories) &amp; bits from the podcast so it’s been super fun catching up. and this isn’t weird or funny really… but yday i was watching translations of gege’s interview come in every few mins and i thought wow this feels exactly like living thru the pre-s7 vld comicon panel. but !! hbu? are exams over?<br><br>i hope u are taking care of yourself and as ever i wish u all the best on your endeavours ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>had to look back through the ch to check this scene again and — oh !! subtext feels like an ultra intelligent term for what i do but yes !! i suppose there is a double meaning here !! <br><br>(and in really just a bunch of random places in flls bc i just toss them in for a giggle whenever an opportunity for one crops up.) <br><br>yuuji isn’t talking abt going to ukai toriyama. or — he is, but he isn’t. i think it’s been implied in the story that he’s always wanted to come to ukai toriyama as a dream date destination or whatever, but when he switches from 'one of my dream places to Go' to 'always wanted to Be here,' he actually shifts (i think, but d—th of the author and all that) to talking abt being in a relationship with megumi. that’s him realizing his answer to a question megumi asks himself later, in that, would they have gotten here if the screenshot / the cup never came into play? and for yuuji i think it clicks in this scene that he’s always wanted to be in a rs with megumi. that as rash a decision as it turned out to be, it is still smth he has always wanted. to experience this environment of being as loved &amp; as happy as he’s being that night — which collides right against his realization too that this isn’t the happiness they’ve been giving each other lately. i think yuuji makes up his mind about most of what happens during their dance scene even before the reception, but i want to say this is when it really settles for him a) what the mature thing to do is; b) that no matter what, he can’t bring himself to regret what they have / had; and c) that despite these two points, despite what he’ll choose to be honest abt and ultimately let go, he probably won’t love anyone else like he loves megumi. or at least that it will be so so difficult for anyone else to come after him. <br><br>hence being ‘dead sure the rest of my life will have a really, really hard time holding up to this.’ bc despite everything, i think he realizes this same night that megumi is his life’s greatest love, no matter what ends up happening in the last chapter.<br><br>thank you so much for reading, and for being so eagle-eyed ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>omg just came back to say you really are unpacking!! thank you for sharing this story with us, i always have so many thoughts when i read a new chapter but i can never string together anything coherent to explain just how i feel 😭 feeling a bit like megumi here. I also love reading your ccs on random topics i just love the way you articulate yourself and write long messages. you seem like someone to have a good conversation with, the type of conversation that could go off tracks into different fun topics and it comes across in your writing. but anyways one random thing did stick with me at the start of the new update. I think its something that was pointed out in yuujis thoughts last last chapter, the empty rooms got me thinking how satosugu have this big house and the kids theyve looked after and shared this huge house with are all going their own paths now. It must feeel so lonely and nostalgic, to me anyway but i was just thinking what are their feelings about all of that <br><br>thank you for this story again 💙🌸</div>

 <div class=reply>this cc made me want to tear up from so many angles oh my god. thank u so much !! for ur kind words abt flls and abt my cc ramblings !! i tend to feel out of depth trying to do justice to these qs so hearing that it comes across to u in the way u so kindly describe here is. i’m very grateful. <br><br>and. ah. the stsg question. <br><br>it must've been jarring in the beginning. miminana would’ve lived in the yushima house throughout high school and their schedules would have informed getou &amp; gojo’s, who otherwise could have just worked in their own time. with the girls around, they know when to expect everyone to be home, when they can have dinner, and in turn, the fushiguro sibs know when to come over for whatever reason. it prob gave routine to their lives, and i think that’s the first thing they noticed the absence of when all three girls moved away at the same time. then the uncomfortable silence settled in. i think there was a time where gojo bothered tf out of megumi to come over more, subconsciously aware he’s the only kid they have left in the area, but idt he parsed it as loneliness, necessarily, tho getou would've been checking on the girls a lot. <br><br>but — Yeah. it must have been really difficult. and this soft wistful nostalgia must remain in the air whenever everyone comes for the monthly dinner. but also. i think yuuji has a diff lens for the emptiness of the house bc he’s never been in a home this big and so obvs designed for so many people and seeing it so empty hit smth in his tendency to romanticize being surrounded by people, but if i wrote this from megumi’s perspective, i think i would have liked to touch on his belief (and this unspoken agreement he has with the other kids) that leaving stsg alone in this big house was almost… necessary? the children were kinda the catalysts for stsg reconnecting (writing ch 6, i thought to myself that getou moves back to tokyo with primarily stability in the girls’ lives in mind, not really fixing everything with gojo) and their presence kinda sustained those early years of being back ~together and being more functional than their younger selves. but cultivating this home for other people doesn’t equate necessarily to them defining home for themselves, esp when they both come from such troubled childhoods. so when they get the chance to be alone in this massive house, to be ‘young’ around each other again and kinda reflect on raising all these kids, i wanna think that leads to a convo one night abt like ‘wow, how tf did we do that? with the parenting We had?’ which unpacks the remaining things they were yet to talk abt. <br><br>but yeah. necessity doesn’t mean they didn’t both take a while to adjust to being the only two in the house. which is why it must have meant a lot for everyone, that first night megumi brought yuuji home as his fake bf. but that’s a diff ramble. <br><br>again, thank you &amp; i wish you all the best in this coming week 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>TAKE MY MONEY MEME DHSHSH this is so very sweet, thank you so, so, so much ❤️<br><br>before anything, i’m super touched you feel this way !! truly, truly, truly !! with that said, i do not have ko-fi, and while i gave some serious thought into making one, my conclusion is that i... don’t... know... if i feel deserving of having people give me, like, real life money for my fics? idk. that’s something for me to personally unpack, since i know i don’t feel this way about literally any other creator who has a ko-fi and that i will happily give them my own money — but. i think i’m still struggling to process why someone would want to give me things for my writing. <br><br>anyway. the main points are: i don’t currently have a ko-fi, i feel weird and a little guilty &amp; slimy about having one, and as such i won’t be making one at the moment — but i am nevertheless very, very, Very grateful for you offering. thank you so much for your generosity and i promise that having you read / support my work at all is more than enough for me :)</div>

 <div class=question>thinking abt how megumi's relationship with loss is so different and involved with the people around him as compared to the other first years and honestly kind of everyone except maybe mayyybe gojou, and even with that there are some core differences - like. his father. his sister. whatever sorcerors he knew growing up bc he KNOWS ppl who've died. and then itadori dying and then shibuya: toji and nobara and itadori Again and gojou (even if they are simply lost and not dead)! and then the news abt tsumiki! and so many other sorcerors he probably knows. wack. also thinking abt nobara's backstory - there must be a chunk of time in between saori and tokyo right? like how did she even start exorcising curses... and she said "first time losing a partner?" to megumi like, bruh, the implications of that 😳👀</div>

 <div class=reply>so much to think abt here and all i want is to open my mouth in a scream like toni colette in hereditary. but anyway. <br><br>nobara &amp; megumi’s talk abt yuuji’s d**th is always so interesting to me in how… like. you pointed out the implications of her saying ‘first time’ the way she did + add to that how megumi responds with ‘first time My Age.’ and i’d love to hear more abt what you meant by megumi’s rs with loss being more ‘involved’ and i don’t wanna speak to that end until then but i will say now that the thing that strikes me always abt megumi and loss is that it never seems fully complete or straightforward for him? how does he process grief and loss when they come in such a convoluted sense for him every time, almost in a way that you can’t really acclimate to no matter how many times you lose sorcerers you know. how do you mourn a father you’d always thought was out there alive, only for him to k-word himself in front of you after you fought him? how do you process losing someone when That’s how you learn you lost them in the first place, not to mention how you never really knew this someone beyond his absence? how do you grieve your sister’s situation when she’s technically alive, except she’s in a coma and under a curse no one really knows what to do with? how do you even grieve yuuji the first time, when you know he’s always had a deadline? and how do you process his current situation now? are you? <br><br>megumi has such a strong sense of responsibility, i think, in that he has to actively be doing things in the name of this feeling of responsibility, or even just his moral compass, though i think this is an oversimplistic term to use for megumi’s perception of right vs wrong. i think he has a specific idea of his own agency (‘i get to choose who i want to protect’) and can be very hard-headed abt this… and it results in such a sharp clash against the grief and loss that permeates his life. bc you can’t manually get yourself out of loss, and esp not the convoluted kinds he has in his life. he was able to train himself to being ~okay post-yuuji’s d**th in the cursed womb arc, but we see the remnants of how much he didn’t actually process in how he reacts to yuuji being in danger in and after the goodwill event arc. his strong sense of acting upon the responsibility he feels kinda has nowhere to go? i feel? when you’ve got stuff like gojo being trapped in this unbreakable box, for example. and sometimes i wonder if this echoes back to his rs with his grief over yuuji’s first d**th and his impending one, in how yuuji might almost be the only person rn he’s lost / on the verge of losing that he can actively do smth about rn. the easiest, most possible person to choose to save. which. idk. idk where i’m going with this. but my point is that megumi is faced rn with so many things that he can’t mahoraga his way out of, and. yeah. we’ll see what he does this arc in reaction to this 😔</div>

 <div class=question>i burst out laughing at how you dry flowers PLEASE JSHDJD ive been researching it and i was like ooh? must be fancy—but,,, yeah,, yeah okay 😭 UR WAY IS VALID TOO 😭😭 i laughed when i saw the linked tumblr post too but 1) reaffirming our deal abt not worrying about wcs (this goes for shorter ones too, ik my ccs can get hella long so don’t sweat it!) just 🤝any and all of ur words are so appreciated 2) pls know im so so endlessly grateful to you for sharing your thoughts. and yeah, all i wanted was snatches of something concrete, you know? i’ve always known working with stories is something i would deeply love 2 do, &amp; editing/curating is an iteration of that that i’ve always been incredibly curious about. buttt i did want to know if there was something outside of the general editing that’s done with books and publishing companies and the like, and u gave some insight into that. so just, thank you. it was a fascinating post. i’m saying this again but god it's such cool work you do, honestly—and the word cool doesn't even really describe how quietly thrilled i am at just. everything you talked about. it’s really exciting!! it really is so cool. gosh. <br><br>it makes me so happy to hear that you like topaz winters 🥺 i think it’s the feeling of their poems that draws me in. like—i don’t think tangible is a good word for how it seems like i can taste or hear or smell or feel their words with alternating/compounding vicious tenderness/softness all at once. reading or listening is an layered experience in and of itself, rather than rereading or picking lines apart to find something deeper—not that the latter is somehow lesser, but i’ve always been one for flow and following words as they go. does that make sense? i hope it does. it’s kind of like how music itself in songs is vastly integral to me being caught up in it—i’ll love the lyrics, but it’s the way it rises or falls alongside that’s so close to my heart. also it was just really really nice seeing an lgbt poc when i was the age i discovered their stuff!! especially one who wrote things i resonated with. <br><br>also JHDFH i feel so strangely honored that you were listening to we’ll be fine while writing flls like *wipes tear* damn,, my homegrown itch for ridiculously soft songs rlly worked out, huh!! i can't wait for it; i bet it’ll be amazing. also ik i unloaded like a boatload of song recs on you but underground (the live version) by cody fry is just insane to listen to with headphones on. i’d heard the original but the live version came on while i was listening to my release radar and i literally went like “bruh” out loud. also!! slightly unrelated but is there any spoken word/read aloud poetry(?)/etc you particularly like, any that you would recommend? <br><br>anyways!! sending you vibes 🌻🌼☀️🧇✨, is there anything mundane or not-so-mundane you particularly liked this week? i hope the day was kind to you!! - 🧚🏽‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>IM SURE THERE IS A FANCIER WAY BUT I PROMISE MY METHOD WORKS IN ITS OWN WAY and oh god i completely forgot i responded to One Part of your cc with an entire tumblr post and now i am mortified all over again. but to affirm the point you made here: yes, there is absolutely a lot outside of the general editing that’s done in book publishing, and from my viewpoint, or at least in canada, book publishing in fact tends to be the most… exclusive? in terms of what experiences you need to qualify. which is understandable, but it’s almost like book editors tend to stick to book editing while editors that don’t necessarily work in the publishing industry find more overlap and variety in the work they do. and this isn’t a criticism of book publishing !! i am very fond of many book editors and agents and i am forever in awe of the work they do. but thank you so much, for saying My work is cool. i am at that stage in life where i want to try everything (and essentially just ch 139 yuuji-running away from the first sign of stagnance) so this is very validating. <br><br>topaz winters is stunning. i think this is the same adjective i used last time but they really are just stunning. ‘vicious tenderness/softness’ is such a good way to put it, and taps into that one hozier quote where he says that loving smth or someone is almost a violent act against the world. and the same with writing, which joan didion i think called aggressive and hostile. there’s like. smth abt the viscerality of words like ‘violent’ and ‘hostile’ that’s almost tender purely bc gets down and dirty into such a deep, specific emotion and i think topaz winters’ work really captures the dynamic that exists in specific kinds of words or flow. and what you said about music—yes yes yes. the whole piece works together to bring you the emotions that it does and it’s just. amazing. every time. the musicality that comes out of such resonant works, whether in literal music form or flow. <br><br>and ah !! someday soon i’ll be able to reply to the lovely comment you left on the last ch of flls, but thank you, thank you, thank you again. for the comment, for luz. and okay okay okay i am furiously noting this song down for later when i can wear headphones. and hnnn no, unfortunately, i don’t have much knowledge about spoken word. i used to listen to the big ones (sarah kay, neil hillborn) a lot but i’m very much a baby on this front in the sense that i discover spoken word poets mostly from the button poetry youtube channel 😅<br><br>as for mundane or not-so-mundane things i’ve been really busy with smth the past couple of days and truly the highlight of my weekend rn is listening to this audio drama where megumi &amp; yuuji follow gojo around akihabara. what about you? i am sending u back vibes as always and i apologize for replying so many days late !!</div>

 <div class=question>i am screaming about how u mentioned that megumi is devoted / loyal BC its true its true oh my god its true. megumi’s devotion to yuuji is so puzzling to me, bc, its not like they grew up tgt or anything of the like, like. they just met. they just met, sleeptowns (sorry can i address u as that? is there any other name u would like to be addressed as?) and megumi’s all, “please save him,” and “these are my personal feelings,” and “if itadori were to fight without cursed engery, he would win,” like????? and what makes it so compelling is that he only thought of tsumiki before and just! just a few months after knowing yuuji, hes devoted to him im in shambles like i cant be coherent enough for this. like he admitted that he had no logical reasons to save him?? none. zilch. nada. the fact that he tried to fight sukuna for him, for his literal /heart/ yeah... well.... like seriously i am Unwell, with a capital u. <br><br>knowing yuuji probably fled the scene straight after the scene w getwo and didnt meet any of them just messes me up bc like imagine the clean up and megumi’s all, “wheres yuuji.” and no one KNOWS oh my god no one knows. like what if this arc is gonna be so punishing to megumi? the zen’in clan, tsumiki, yuuji, woooowwwwwww gege wooowwwwww. we’re in for a ride in the angst train........ choo choo...,,.,:£&amp; <br><br>OH MY GOD!!!! UR QUOTES NOOO IM- IM IN SHAMBLES i love them all TT_TT theyre perfect. ur right ur right ur absolutely right, itfs is all abt choosing someone come what may &amp; following someone to the ends of the earth. god i need a minute to process these . i like how u say choose bc choose is such a powerful word to me? i choose u, out of anyone else i choose u. *head in hands* <br><br>reminds me, u know how juju sanpo is directed by gege? so i take it as canon sorta and theres the scene where yuuji said he taught megumi to make the meatballs? and how the recipe calls for two servings(?) of ginger and it ties back with megumi who likes ginger? like ok the implication of it all but. but. “i love you. i want us both to eat well.” (by christopher citro) like . how do u want me to recover from that?! <br><br>(yes! its fine! im flattered and a lil bit flustered that u like it enough to post it, so thank u)</div>

 <div class=reply>i am. vigorously nodding. megumi’s devotion isn’t always the soft, tender kind to me; it’s a little rough and sharp and misguided, but i do think he truly is devoted to the people he loves, no matter what that love looks like. and yeah !! his loyalty to yuuji is also so puzzling to me? i once saw a naver post abt how megumi might be yuuji’s first memory manipulation victim — but i don’t? buy that? at all? i had a meltdown abt it, then i thought abt it rationally and it’s like. nah. doesn’t add up as it is in canon. his rs w yuuji is too nuanced to be blind devotion; he struggles + wrestles with it, he understands the layers of his own feelings as a human being with messy emotions vs as a sorcerer — and despite it, he still chooses yuuji (to use that word again, bc i really do think choice is what their rs comes down to. their ability to choose each other is, i think, the backbone of everything right and wrong in their dynamic. choosing to protect each other, to keep each other safe, to trust each other.) idk if he will this arc, but it is my hope that he does.<br><br>but like. speaking on a surface level, i still have no answers for why m’s so attached. on one hand: same, i’d be too. but idk why his conviction is as strong as it is? is it remnant grief post-tsumiki being cursed? is it smth else? why was his entire worldview funneled overnight into this one person? after yuuji returns — i get it. megumi’s happy to have him back and is desperate not to lose him again. the immediate loyalty makes sense when it’s from yuuji’s behalf, but megumi is a little more inscrutable in the smaller details — and idk. i’ll get back to this thought once we get our first megumi bits this arc. <br><br>WHERE’S YUUJI STOP now i am also Unwell with a capital u. it makes me nervous that megumi is “leading the search” for yuujI — which is such. a suspicious term for it vs the initial translation we got. but i’m just. trying to cushion my fall at this point. sometimes yuuji &amp; megumi love each other so much that my pessimism kicks in and i’m like nah nah nah it can’t be this good. it can’t be this tender. not in this series. not in their world. but gege said they’re not rivals — though i’m never sure how much i trust what gege says in their interviews; this person has given me borderline trauma — and i just. am not prepared for where this arc takes us with that in mind. bc at this point devotion lowkey devastates me just as much as the alternative.<br><br>and ahhh making food as one of yuuji’s love languages is smth that’s been in my mind since that juju sanpo !! and i love this quote sm !! but it’s also sad. bc in a way yuuji prepared megumi for him being gone by teaching him how to make the meatballs instead of making them for him — but it’s prob not that deep. or maybe it is. idk !! they hurt me so much !! god !!<br><br>and yes ofc you can call me that! sha is fine as well, thank u sm for asking ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>“that’s nobara and her boys!” Is honestly one of my favorite ways to look at the first year trio’s dynamic. and it’s funny because usually I really love angst in a series and I still do for this one, but god... I don’t know if it is because I’ve grown so attached to these characters and their friendship, but jjk is hurting me to the core. For once, I’m just begging for no more pain lmao. I want the itafushikagi to be happy but I know that their ending will probably end with a bittersweet tragedy. Sigh... there's gonna be special place in hell for gege akutami—I’ll fight him. He can’t just create a fantastic trio dynamic and then tear it apart. Like what have you done, gege</div>

 <div class=reply>I KNOW !! LIKE? the first core trio i’ve been this irrevocably attached to and this is what we get weekly... but yeah. their dynamic means so much to me in all the ways they connect to each other and all the different stuff that has had to happen to get there and it’s like — i know what akutami will do to them. to this. to me. i have zero trust on getting a happy ending. but am i too invested to look away? unfortunately.</div>

 <div class=reply>i always blank for qs like this, i feel, so i apologize in advance — but yes !! i do !! 🤍<br><br>in english, i adore small words that feel like… soft wool? cashmere? (okay, so maybe i’m not the best at textiles, but i mean—) words that feel like soft fabric. understated and simple but carries a lot of texture. like the word soft itself, or loft/lofty. quiver. tremble. pastry. coffee. tremor. laughter, but not laugh. brush. woolen. murmur. or words that are by nature v—lent &amp; visceral: bone. shatter. gut. break. love love love the palpable recoil in these words.<br><br>anything bird &amp; sky related is also an automatic yes: avian, corvid, sparrow, robin, wren, flight. and cute words like: sleep, mint, spoon.<br><br>i am not always the fondest of ~long words — i find them overly specific &amp; i think very unwieldy in cases where specific is just detrimental to the imagery or the flow of the sentence (like lassitude, serendipity, effervescence, or any word that might be jarring when used greedily, or simply not as versatile as smaller, broader words bc they have too much presence) — but i have a tender spot for the word solitude. i think that might be the latin origin speaking, though; solus/sola/solum is one of my favourite latin adjectives for the sole reason that it’s pretty all around the paradigms. except i also think solitude has lovely connotations: being alone as something chosen, as something comfortable and necessary.</div>

 <div class=question>hi hi hi 😭 this isnt a reply 2 ur reply (ive read both that and the post and i'm def sharing my thoughts later hehe they were much appreciated) BUT im seeing ur ccs and getting jjk brainrot and i dont have jjk mutuals so 😭 BUT YEAH i like jjk so much bc its genuinely interesting and like. more fun to puzzle out compared to bnha or vld etc, where dissecting things often comes with a boatload of annoyance at some of the creators choices. like ik jjk isnt perfect but seeing some of the parallels n connections are SO interesting like why did megumi specifically say ill kill you if you die? why has something so directly enmeshed with death become their go-to, when yuuji's death sentence is perpetually hanging over everyone's head, when megumi's very noticeably is the primary reason hes alive in the first place? like there's no way thats NOT deliberate, not after yuuji actually died and they've established it as smth that isnt a one-time thing to say. akutami seems like,, aware enough to actually use his female characters well (after bnha thats Such a relief lol) so im vaguely sure nobara being slightly distanced from that weird little partnership w itafushi is on purpose, and thats SO interesting. bc shes been shown to continuously have been underestimated &amp; she always comes out of nowhere in the coolest fucking way. and their dynamic!! omg what are ur thoughts on itafushikugi? ive read through the entire tag and like,, platonic or romantic their relationship is just so cool. and remember how i talked about their diverging paths in my uhh first cc? im so excited for whatevers going on in the manga rn bc thats happening to some extent. nobara's gotta be plot significant otherwise they wouldve confirmed her as dead &amp; ofc megumi and yuuji have to deal with wildly different situations and its honestly so fascinating. im so !!! MAN . YELLING RN. also omfg bye all the art with megumi in zenin robes and yuuji in his runaway hoodie is KILLING me . man 🥺🥺 - 🧚🏽‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>oh my god. felt. absolutely felt that. i haven’t kept up with bnha since i stopped writing for it in 2016 so i can’t speak much there, but having it right next to vld is. yeah. gotcha. noted. it’s funny bc i was thinking last night that the last time i felt this much dread and borderline anguish over a fixation was with vld, then i was like. nah. that’s not even remotely the same. it’s one thing to agonize over creators’ choices i don’t agree with, to put it lightly, but another to be so invested in smth to the point of visceral emotions. and i admit i’m not the brightest at theorizing abt jjk, but the fact that i’m able to do it and dread it and overthink it and have some emotional release no matter what ends up happening, i’m thankful after what vld put me through. <br><br>and i… know right? idk what the best translation is for megumi saying that and if this one is perfectly accurate at all (and i can’t wait to hear it in the next ep) but like. saying it one time can be ignored, i think. megumi was feeling a lot in that moment. but the callback in shibuya made me ? bc i was one of the folks who brushed off todo’s memory thing in goodwill event until we started getting the same with choso then jogo, etc. and now. i’m watching you, gege. i’m looking. also, when i was writing h&amp;w, one of my trains of thought was: if it’s three live + one d--s OR one lives + three d-- and nobara survives shibuya (which i very much think she did), how will gege navigate unaliving three of the four characters when three of them have already unalived once? (or in nobara’s case, we thought she unalived) (which. wait. now, i’m like, oh, god, megumi. please survive this series.) <br><br>as for nobara’s distance... yeah i. i have the most tender spot for seeing her perspective on the other two as a partnership. like. she’s never known them apart. from the moment she met them, they were side by side. and i think i said this in / abt h&amp;w, but it’s not that i think she feels Apart from them or that she isn’t as close with them as they are to each other; if anything, i don’t think she envies them their dynamic at all. but ahhh i feel like i’ve cemented nobara not liking boys so much that i can’t see it romantically, but i also know i love platonic itafushikugi with everything i have. it’s so good in its smaller iterations (megumi + nobara’s dynamic vs nobara + yuuji’s, both of which make me feel So much) but when they’re altogether it’s just. that’s them !! that’s nobara and her boys !! <br><br>ughhh i’m also v excited (and dreading) the trio’s situation in the manga rn. i won’t be surprised if we don’t see nobara for a while, but i know than when we do... man. i love her so much. and yes yes yes yes god i saw lost in paradise art of nobara w an eyepatch, megumi dressed like the zenins and yuuji in his runaway hoodie. and ah. feeling blessed, despite the context. feeling grateful.</div>

 <div class=reply>i was ABOUT to say, before i got to the end of your cc, that the entirety of jjk feels like this dhsjsks i was just telling someone that i have never felt this much constant dread about consuming a piece of media before. and of course i am enjoying the story — i wouldn’t be here if i wasn’t so invested — but it’s that investment in it and the characters and dynamics like yuuji &amp; megumi’s that causes the dread in the first place like good god gege i came here for serotonin and now i am in fetal position every sunday</div>

 <div class=reply>that’s so. that is one of the most comforting collections of words i’ll ever read abt my writing. thank u so much for saying this. it’s so meditative &amp; lovely. <br><br>that said, yes, i have def thought abt writing stsg !! there are attempts floating around, but they’re abandoned bc. okay. inevitable, i think, is the word that comes to mind when i poke at stsg. platonic or romantic or their spv arc selves or their volume 0 selves or whatever we have left of those selves in current canon, their dynamic feels like an inevitability to me &amp; that’s their appeal &amp; their tragedy. i know there’s a lot to be said abt what Could’ve been, all the diff things that could’ve happened if someone did smth or the other didn’t do another thing, but i actually find them to be narratively… complete? as far as getou the person goes, i think gojo got his ending with him. the tragedy ofc is in the older kamo hijacking the body, but that’s the thing: stsg’s tragedy, for me, is in the tragedy that has come &amp; gone. their tragedy is in the POST-tragedy aftermath that we see now. their tragedy is in how (at least i think) their separation was inevitable &amp; one of them knew it a lot earlier than the other. those are the parts that hurt, but those are also the parts that are complete from what i think. maybe complete isn’t the right word. but it’s there. it happened. it’s tragic that it did. &amp; i personally don’t think there’s anything in that canon situation that i can explore or add anything new to. <br><br>i once thought i could sink my teeth into a parallel universe situation, maybe explore canon divergence in the most literal of ways, but rn i think both gojo &amp; getou cannot be divorced from the canon circumstances that made them who they are, as individuals and as who they are to e/o &amp; that to take that away doesn’t quite make them them—for me, at least! let me emphasize that. &amp; also only from the standpoint of whether i’ll write them in canon, bc i have very much enjoyed writing them into the bg of my au &amp; want so bad to give them a prequel. <br><br>that said i love how rooted their dynamic is in seeing each other as The best friend, unequivocally companions/equals (for a time) &amp; i love how nothing was able to take that connection out of the equation even when they diverged. in a kinder world, that feels easier to explore. no less tragic, but it reframes everything i love abt them. their inside jokes, their bickering, their diff personalities but somehow the same braincell behind both kinda compatibility &amp; rapport, how they HAD to separate at some point.<br><br>i’m running out of characters but main points: i love stsg. i love what they meant to e/o. my heart breaks for them, yet they don’t make me sad about what could’ve been. i don’t think there’s a could’ve been &amp; That makes me sad. i’ll happily attempt to write them in an au. but i doubt i’ll ever have enough creativity in me to spark a compelling canon fic idea.</div>

 <div class=reply>honestly, honestly, honestly i was repressing &amp; compartmentalizing about 138 just fine until i got this cc and then went on twitter and now i’ve just. had my head in my hands for the past 24hrs. “don’t go where i can’t follow” ouch ouch ouch :( <br><br>one of the first tweets i saw was somewhere along the lines of: megumi still believes in yuuji/wants to protect him. and i have. faith. in megumi. i think. it’s gege i have no trust in. but also, megumi has so much to handle right now and the fact that he’s also leading the search for yuuji in the midst of all this mess is—oh, megumi. it’s just grief after grief after grief and you can’t hand-make justice for everyone. and like, i knew rationally that we weren’t going to get a reunion hug bc it’s gege (i hoped anyway) but no yuuji &amp; megumi reunion at all? at least at the moment? and while megumi is trying to find a yuuji intent on running away? plus tsumiki is in the equation? god. <br><br>there’s so much devotion/loyalty/righteousness/whatever you wanna call it in megumi &amp; it makes me so !! that there are so many elements in this arc to test that—and we’re like what? two chapters in?—and just. jesus. i’m gonna develop hypertension bc of this series. <br><br>yuuji &amp; megumi’s stubborn need to protect each other will never fail to get me where i’m already tender and fragile like damn it !! they care about each other so much and now we’re really in it !! i don’t even know i’m sorry this is so incoherent i haven’t processed anything except that i’m feeling a lot<br><br>(i’ll be right back in the next cc. i need to have a Word with you, mariposa.)</div>

 <div class=reply>okay, can i just. sit with you on this metaphorical floor for a sec. i apologize if this is overstepping as a stranger, but if i could just make an addition to my last reply:<br><br>first of all, you’re very much allowed to let yourself feel whatever you’re feeling from this. it doesn’t take away from whatever happens now; it doesn’t make you any less or any more of something. second of all, i am very, very sorry to hear that. i—can’t offer much by way of rational evidence, bc ofc we don’t know each other very well at all &amp; i have nothing tangible to present, but for what it’s worth, i know that one unexpected diversion from a college you may have wanted to be accepted to doesn’t subtract from you being you &amp; what you want to do. from your two ccs, i can glean a couple of things: one, that you are doing wonderfully for yourself where you’re at in life &amp; in school right now. not expecting to be rejected is worth much more than you might think it does in this moment, at least from my perspective. two, it sounds to me like you’re quite a resilient person. it’s hard to not let such a big, specific thing bother you, &amp; the way that you’re actively working to ensure that’s the case? i think that’s amazing.<br><br>and if i add these two things together, i also feel fairly valid in saying that i have faith you’ll be okay. you don’t have to be right now, &amp; it’s completely understandable if you Are bothered by it for a while, but wherever your college years take you, or whatever you decide to go from here, i believe you will most definitely find a way to be more than alright and to find your way to where you need to be.<br><br>again, i’m sorry if this feels too personal or overdramatic or like i’ve crossed a boundary in making these conjectures shshjsks i hope you’ve been feeling better in the days it’s been since you sent me the cc, if even just a little, and that you’re taking care of yourself ❤️</div>

 <div class=question>hello wtf omg thats so adorable. a mixtape, buttons, annotated books?? dude thats so cool 😭 and omfg i was thinking of putting dried flowers but i have no idea how to like.. dry them KJDHDK. i may put little origami butterflies too hehe :) and YEAH like i heart abt the concept of an advent calender &amp; i was like huh so i have small gift ideas for every day of august leading to the 26th, which is my best friend's bday &gt;:) like tiny earrings, quotes, pictures, letters or essays or drabbles ive written for her, a cute small art piece too. bc its a joke that we keep forgetting each other's bday gifts but my 16th birthday was kind of ass and she sent me this basket full of chocolate/pics even tho we couldn't meet up &amp; it made my day. also w quarantine it's like. yk u miss ur friends n wanna show them u appreciate them. so yeah!! i dunno how i'm gonna put it together but i'm thinking some box with envelopes/packages lined up. it'll be cute. <br><br>i could say,, SO much about language and how it ties to identity and how deeply personal it can be bc i def get what they must’ve been saying abt language loss hjdfjhd altho ofc migration is very different from being whitewashed in ur own country—but anyways. i think it’s still super cool that the stories are being told, bc in so many places they Aren't? and the loss of shared stories is very horrible and keen in a special way bc it’s a personal loss, historical loss, cultural loss. but yeah, i get what you mean abt doing justice. also!! how does it work? where do the recordings go?<br><br>i also wanted to ask about your experiences with editing? like as a whole—in what capacity do u do it, what do you think is important for it, etc. i’ve had a nagging interest in editing and curating (spoken in a v loose sense lol) stories for a long long time and i still don't know much about it, but yeah! i’ve seen some of ur tweets abt it, whats ur experience like!!<br><br>and!! i have the space for it so flls!! HELLO THE POV CHANGE WAS FUCKING MASTERFUL im going wild i’m such a fan of it. i ended the chapter literally like 😳 bc that subtly built up feeling of inner conflict and then that final emotional door slam KILLED me. i dunno how to describe it but i was enraptured the entire time. so good!!! and again, the format was absolutely amazing—i really, really like how this chapter was crafted. like the whole sequence of events and the way tension rose and fell more straightforwardly throughout the various interactions but somehow contributed towards this looming background precariousness—SO cool. so cool. and it was so enjoyable too!! like on one hand you have the complexity of these silly boys' thoughts and overall dynamics but thats interspersed so naturally with light and genuine moments that it flowed absolutely effortlessly. UGH. smh at ur skill. running out of chars so thank u for the gorgeous chapter!! have a lovely day &amp; i'm throwing u good vibes from across the ocean!! - 🧚‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>i honestly… just… wait for the flowers to dry in their vase and… sometimes i squash them in a book. which is unrefined i know i am sorry to tell you this dhsjsj i know there’s probably a more useful way of going about it. like? some people microwave their flowers?i and ohhhh my god holy shit that’s amazing ??? a gift for each day to celebrate her, oh how nice 🥺❤️ and yes i def agree with gifts in friendship kind of having to accommodate distance during quarantine :( super strange (and nice in a way if, y’know, we weren’t in a global pandemic) that we’ve reframed how to show care &amp; love from afar now that it’s our only option.<br><br>&amp; yes, exactly! stories carry so much and in losing them, we lose all the things tied to them—and there’s so much to be grieved in that loss. the concept of dead languages is such a tragic thing to me—and not just the big ones like latin n greek + not to cheapen loss by calling it a word as dramatic as tragic. but i once studied languages that we know existed but have no traces of—and that not knowing is so haunting? to me? that someone somewhere out there communicated the depth of human emotion &amp; experience in words that will never be accessible to anyone else and has been lost to time or assimilation or whatever it may be. but anyway. the recordings go to an audio documentary series on a broadcast station program + in radio/podcast form as well !! <br><br>OH I AM SO SO GLAD YOU LIKED THE POV CHANGE !! THANK U SO MUCH. you called it subtle AND enjoyable 😭 i really wrestled with giving the ch room to breathe in small light moments bc i didn’t want the fight to overtake how much i genuinely think they love each other, even if it meant an unbearably long ch teetering between those &amp; (what i hope are) moments of tension. having the fight be a big yelling thing would have cheapened it i think but i still very much wanted it to be… sharp? but anyway. i feel v comforted by the things u pointed out here, thank u so so much. i hope you are well &amp; sending u good vibes right back! 🌸🤍🌱✨<br><br>(not a lot of room left but oh ymg od topaz winters is stunning! i’m watching their ted talk tonight after just Devouring their spoken word/poetry &amp; oh godddddddd)<br><br>(last thing: i’ve been writing the next flls ch and we’ll be fine by luz has been a godsend and i have u to thank for that so thank u thank u thank u) 🤍<br><br>(last last thing: see reply to tweet for the editing q part) (i’m so sorry)</div>

 <div class=question>I just read the new chapter of flls. I don't know how to put together my thoughts so sorry if this makes no sense. First the narrative you picked to start the chapter always making me feel too much like the character but as I read on and finished I realised why you would pick that. Yuuji navigating his life juggling group chats, meet ups, school, work, his plans with friends and megumi how full his days are makes you feel like those movie scenes when directors intentionally use that fisheye lense when a character is going through some intense emotions and it feels like they are right in your face. Almost makes you feel overwhelmed by the characters emotions and that was the same vibe I got when I finished the chapter and noticed that megumi's words in the last scene when he says yuuji needs so much, it kind of reflected yuujis routine that we get in second person narrative in the first scenes. I just love your writing it was like this whole chapter came full circle and I was like ah I get it. Theres also the way megumi seems to find it difficult to understand how someone can need so much to exist is almost a mirror of yuuji's thoughts on he doesnt clearly get how megumi can describe his day with one word answers because to yuuji so much happens in a day when hes waking up at 5am. They both just go about socialising differently but there was so much more to unpack but I just want to say I had fun reading that. So yeahhhhh I just want them to communicate and be happy. 😭</div>

 <div class=reply>oooh the fisheye lens is a very interesting comparison to make, and one i’m thankful to hear bc i was wrestling for a while about how to really hammer in how Full &amp; Busy yuuji’s days are and how to put all of us, including myself, in that? it already struck me while writing chapter 3, but in chapter 5, i knew i wanted it to be almost… exhausting? suffocating? without actually being that. so while second person has never been a thing i liked in longform stories, i’ve always wanted to try it and i figured. hey. why not. let’s give it a shot here. and when that started flowing better than it was when i was trying all these things in yuuji’s day in third person, i found that it was the right kind of “oh my god when will this end” feeling that i was going for. i’m rambling sorry i just meant i’m really glad to hear that this sense of being right in your face came across to you in some way as a reader. and that it felt cyclical by the time you reached the end, bc it was an uncomfortably slow boil for me as a writer and i really hoped that (as weird as it sounds) it would be subtly so for readers as well !!<br><br>i haven’t gotten around to replying to comments for this ch but as for where megumi &amp; yuuji are at rn, it’s very cool for me to see how everyone has interpreted their differences? but with that said, i completely agree that neither of them are right or wrong necessarily in that the way they socialize is just different, period, and by extension, their love languages are as well. i wanted to hone in on their canon selves’ incompatibility fighting next to each other, which kinda just became this whole thing of their flls selves just being incompatible as social people. but i also think (not to be pretentious) that it goes a little deeper than them just needing to communicate, bc talking about it won’t rewire their entire worldviews, yknow what i mean? so i appreciate you saying that there is much more to unpack. i… am trying to unpack it. <br><br>thank u so so much for sharing your thoughts with me on this chapter !! i was particularly anxious abt this one, just bc i’ve never written anything like it before, so it’s been very appreciated to hear what you’re thinking on such a contemplative level ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>this is a very broad q that i will attempt to answer broadly for now bc i don’t want to Not give you an answer at all, but do feel free to follow up with more context should my response be an altogether bad fit for what u meant !!<br><br>with that said, i am no authority on this whatsoever, and all i have to offer rn are some thoughts i took down at 4am. they’re not much, and i apologize if they don’t quite suffice.<br><br>as with most things, i don’t think there’s a proper way, really, to deal with rejection. sometimes you just have to ride it like a wave. other times you have to turn it into a push forward, even if it’s the last thing you want to do, even if you have to fake it ‘til you make it. bc the truth is that rejection happens a lot, in so many forms. and statistically speaking that also means there will be times that that rejection has merit to it, that maybe — and i say this with as much kindness as i can — the rejection is warranted. but by this same logic, there will be as many times that this rejection Won’t be fair. and if anything, the only element u have to have figured out isn’t how to cope emotionally with rejection, but how to discern whether that rejection is fair or not and to do with that what you will. did that submission need a little more work and that’s probably why it was rejected? jump off that and get that thing into an even better version of itself. you’re already halfway there. did someone reject you bc of one thing you can’t help about yourself? not fair at all; use it as a reminder that you’re worth so much more than smth like this. which i know is much, much easier said than done at the end of the day, but i assure you that — and this is smth i know will sound cold but has been central to my work in wrestling with anxiety — it is very, very, very rarely about you. sometimes, smth is rejected bc it isn’t a right fit for what an editor has the time to dedicate their work to atm. sometimes, someone is rejected for no other reason than another person not feeling like they would be compatible, whether in a job setting or a romantic relationship, or the feelings are simply not there at all. and it’s not on u to change that. yes, you’re allowed to feel dejection from rejection. yes, you are so so so allowed to feel the hurt of feeling rejected, especially if it’s smth personal to you, whether it’s u yourself or smth that might as well be u — but it’s not On you, and most times, it isn’t even About you. if it feels like it is, consider it from the perspective of the other person: is someone not giving you the time of day bc they genuinely don’t have time to give? is someone cruel to you bc they have issues of their own that they shouldn’t even be projecting onto another person in the first place? <br><br>the thing is: don’t let rejection form a narrative about who and what you are. rejection is only as layered as many other things in life. most importantly, as are you.</div>

 <div class=reply>i’ve always wondered myself… so i won’t say i have specific headcanons, bc nonfiction is such a particular genre to commit to yet an incredibly broad one within itself — so. huh. i once wrote him in passing reading tachibana takashi, who’s this journalist/social activist/politician, and i feel like that’s reflective of what i Think he reads? megumi seems to have specific ideas about retributive justice (a term i’m using loosely here based off his worldview in canon so far + his argument with yuuji in the cursed womb arc) and while i think a lot of that can be explained by his lack of stability in childhood, i also feel comfortable saying that he probably consumes a lot of stuff that contributed to forming the perspective he has now? a lot of journalistic/investigative type of nonfiction, at times sliding over into polisci/philosophy. i can see him being fond of essays, reading one or two from the same collection in between missions or whenever he has free time. <br><br>to contextualize*, i’m thinking stuff like foucault and didion (books like discipline and punish &amp; slouching towards bethlehem, respectively, though the latter leans into some new journalism that i’ll get to in a sec), some sontag, hunter s. thompson and bob woodward kinds of subjects, maybe a little history? and he’s def read the analects once out of curiosity. then, later on in life, if i may wander into headcanon territory even further, he kinda graduates from this kind of nonfiction and (i want to think) starts wandering into the more creative / narrative works of the same writers he’s been reading, like maybe going from sontag’s political work to her book on photography, to didion’s essays on grief and life and maybe even her plays. here and there maybe he’ll pick up the occasional novel that’s heavier on themes more explored in nonfiction: dostoyevsky, orwell, or contemporary stuff like frankissstein by jeanette winterson maaaaaybe even things like margaret atwood’s speculative stuff. <br><br>all in all, i’m not the most well-versed about this sort of thing bc i myself am picky about what i read and as such i don’t read as extensively as i’d like*, but these are the Vibes i get from megumi’s general way of speaking and approaching discussions (like in his infirmary bed post-goodwill convo w yuuji, which panned out differently to me than yuuji’s similarly borderline philosophical conversation with nobara at the end of origin of obedience) !! <br><br><br>* note: like i said, i’m not the most widely-read person, and these are all painfully western writers, &amp; i don’t actually think a teen living in tokyo would be consuming them necessarily (or maybe he would be) so much as i think these are the type of writing styles he would be seeking out in whatever their counterparts are in the japanese nonfiction corpus (like tachibana takashi) <br><br>p.s. i had to sit in front of my bookshelf to think abt this cc; thank you so much for such an interesting question !!</div>

 <div class=question>YEAH,, fond sigh. i like it like that—sweetness &amp; hilarity &amp; all. its such a good basis for any relationship, platonic or romantic. and it's so incredibly sweet that you send letters to ur friends on special occasions 🥺🥺 i bet they absolutely love them. what sort of knick knacks do u add? and yea omg i love collecting little gift ideas for friends!! i met a bunch of people this last year and got back into so many things (like writing and poetry and being soft and. well. gifts) &amp; they're inspiring enough ive started actually making gifts now! bc its fun and nice and tbh i could write a weird soft little short story &amp; gift it for someones birthday &amp; they'd b happy. im planning out an advent calendar-esque gift for my best friend’s bday and thats all the way in august—she'll have NO idea what hit her. <br><br>also—im going to die holy shit, thats such an incredibly cool job!! wtf! its lovely hearing abt that pakistani-canadian poet btw 🥺 im like!! hello there!! kinship! and that reminds me like i saw ur posts abt language (SO COOL BTW HELLO. U KNOW SO MUCH) and ive been interested in its intertwined dynamic w history/art/culture too yk? there's so much thats intrinsic to language—like folktales!! and audio storytelling is something that im literally going wild over bc first of all i'm just so in love with the very notion of it, second: im fascinated by the concept of oral folktales etc &amp; their being passed down/subsequent evolution, &amp; also how they've been affected by coming into contact with colonial influence esp (gag). also you don't understand im still stuck on how thrilled i am by audio storytelling like. literally bouncing rn. it sounds so sososo cool, what's it like?<br><br>also re: your thoughts on poetry. thats so valid &amp; thats rly beautiful too &amp; i get u—its interesting bc its kind of the opposite for me? like i recently got into poetry so i'll admit i dont have much exposure to it, but—central to my dynamic w it is like. my friends and i. bc i met them over writing fanfic but a friend shared his poems with me and they were obviously kinda messy bc amateur yk, but there's nothing quite like poetry being so personal it aches, and its personal in a way that rly hits bc u KNOW the poet, yea? its a little freeing w how raw it gets. and there’s nothing quite like it being written for you, either. but at the same time i do get you—i think this ^ sometimes straddles the line bw prose and poetry, and i get how untouchable poetry can feel sometimes. and i love the connection bw music and words that you draw!! i think thats a rlly lovely way to talk abt it. <br><br>JDHFJHD no reason they’re just catchy hehe. catch me listening to my perpetually-full-of-breakup/yearning-songs queue LMAO but i’m glad you liked them!! (also check out topaz winters! i remember reading them as a tiny 13 year old and being so moved.) have a lovely day!! - 🧚‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>yeah !! it’s easy to forget the sweetness, which i think is such a critical part of liking someone in the first place, whether platonic or romantic — oh, that is exactly what you just said in the next sentence. oh god. and ahh that’s so sweet of you to say! i’m not the most expressive person irl, so my available love languages are limited. i know it’s not much, and not the same as explicit reminders of love, but special letters are my main chance to really hammer in the love &amp; gratitude. but anyway !! the knickknacks depend on the person. paper cranes, mixtapes, sometimes i’ll buy a secondhand book and annotate it. postcards are a big one, too !! as well as um… what’s the word… button pins? is what we called it in the philippines. not sure what the canadian term for it is. little pins and brooches and such. OH AND DRIED FLOWERS. i like to make cards with dried flowers. which brings me to oh my goddddd making gifts is so fun i totally agree !! just hearing about your ideas make me miss feeling soft and warm over gifts — like? a short story? and an advent calendar??? that’s SO wonderful oh my goodness how does the calendar work?<br><br>and ahh thank u !! i love the audio production world !! it’s been so so cool for me as well, esp in how it has informed my own written storytelling in terms of sound and syntax and all that — and also just a different appreciation for how lucky i am to be able to tell stories with words at all. also, interesting that you bring all this up bc the pakistani-canadian poet’s recording was for an ep on language loss — which has really centred for me how much of connection we lose and gain in the things, as you say, that are intrinsic to language and the ways we fall under and beyond it. another poet i recorded with sang a little Métis story for me — and part of the thoughts that have been in my mind since in working with these stories is how i position myself as a settler living on stolen land in canada telling the stories of people whose histories cannot be divorced from colonial influence. how do i approach their experiences during the editing &amp; music-composing process? how do i do their stories justice in My storytelling? <br><br>also yes, god, when poetry is so personal it aches — i do think that’s words at their best. words in this confined space, left to tell its story within that? i think it was kazuo ishiguro who said smth along the lines of how writing, for him, comes down to: “this is how x feels for me. is this how it feels for you?” and i think nothing gets that down to such a fundamental level than poetry. which isn’t to discredit prose or any other medium of storytelling. but it is definitely smth i respect And find untouchable about certain poetry.<br><br>i have several topaz winters readings open on tabs rn !! this is so exciting; i will dig in for this weekend for sure ❤️<br><br>i hope you have the loveliest day 🧚‍♀️ !!</div>

 <div class=reply>daughter is one of my go-tos for Sad-sad music so this just knocked me right out of my body when you sent this at 3:47 AM. like, these lyrics: <br><br>I've been trying to stay out<br>But there's something in you<br>I can't be without<br>I just need it here<br><br>oh ?? my god??? oh my god??? <br><br>thank you so much for describing my writing so thoughtfully. to know h&amp;w was able to evoke such emotion as to be called words like “phenomenal” and “heart wrenching” — thank you for taking the time to share this with me + to have me revisiting this heart wrenching song ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>hi !! ✧ here is the short answer:<br><br>i am bilingual !! english and tagalog !!<br><br>✧ here’s the more in-depth rambling answer: <br><br>ahhh this is an odd question to answer bc i feel like i’m trying to flex knowing full well i have nothing at all to flex when i wholeheartedly believe i’m not fluent in like. any language. but. okay. so. <br><br>i’m filipino-canadian and i’m fluent in english &amp; tagalog and — if in enough distress in montreal — directional and conversational french bc i don’t wanna be judged. i was also a linguistics &amp; classics double major, so technically i’ve earned the credits and certificates to say i have reading proficiency in italian and german (the former has its good days; the latter never has days, period), and i think i’m as passable in ancient greek as i am more than passable in latin (this is my only point of pride, ever. my self esteem is single handedly held up by my latin proficiency.) i also studied korean for three years in high school to get out of doing french, though i have only enough left these days to get by with “how have you been” / “it’s cold outside” conversations with my friends’ parents. spanish is intuitive and beautiful, very similar to the romance languages + tagalog that i have under my belt, so i’ve tried learning it by translating some neruda sonnets for a voltron wip i had before. but that’s an abandoned project now. <br><br>anyway i’m so sorry this feels like an awful humble brag and i promise you there is absolutely nothing for me to be bragging about and i am often too anxious to speak in anything but english and tagalog anyway, and sometimes even those. i just wanted to answer at length, but to clarify: when people ask me this question in person, i am most comfortable just saying that i am ✨ bilingual ✨<br><br>and oh my god ofc !! so many languages i want to learn !! i think for 2021, i’d like to sharpen up on some japanese. i also want to gain some understanding of russian bc i have a special fondness for inflected languages. but before anything else, i probably need to brush up on all these languages i’m rusty on. i don’t know. so many languages, so little time and such short attention span to crack down and learn. but we’ll see. thank you so much for this pleasant surprise of a question 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oh sorry i was just leaving a note for myself and didn’t think to maybe elaborate — but what i meant was that i think nanami &amp; megumi are both enneagram type 1s with type 9 wings !!<br><br>i don’t know what the best label is to give the enneagram but i suppose it's a personality type ~system? kind of like the mbti? which i’m not the biggest fan of for myself, and the enneagram is my go-to for friends and compatibility and often even writing. i can elaborate on this more, if you’d like, but i didn’t know what kind of answer would be best rn so do also feel free to look up enneagram types for now or let me know if it’s confusing and i’ll see how well i can explain 😊</div>

 <div class=question>ok deal i wont worry about length if u dont worry abt length 😤 which, btw, isn’t smth you should ever be concerned abt—i read every word of ur replies more than once &amp; smile uncontrollably every time. but yeah!! nostalgia as a concept is so dear to me 🥺 i tried finding words 2 describe it and literally the only thing i can think of is Shaking It Emphatically bc its so 🥺🥺 so 🥺 it makes me want to yell.<br>also! im smiling too!! its ok i appreciate ur all caps—that's what im like rn too. i feel like a dumb lovesick teenager with a dumb puppy love crush &amp; its just FUN 2 be so cliche &amp; young. it’s not monumental or anything but! she’s funny &amp; super cool &amp; sweet &amp; so fucking weird its hilarious—its cute. its rly cute. <br>thinking abt letters and &amp; it’s sm fun thinking of stuff to add—like obvs there’s the customary (looong) letter but i wanna slip in a playlist/jewellery/some of my art. OR POLAROIDS,, gawd that's so cute 🥺 catch me stealing someone’s camera. i’m gonna make so many little sketches &amp; doodles &amp; slip them in. im so giddy. <br>anyways GOSH THAT'S SO COOL OMG i've always found theatre fascinating!! i’ve never really just sat down and talked about all the ways i find a piece of media interesting, which is blah,, i rly wish i could learn more abt it!! maybe when i'm in college. the intersection of words and sound is so unbelievably interesting to me—like. slam poetry? theatre, spoken word? if you’ve ever heard of urdu/persian(?) poetry it’s absolutely gorgeous &amp; i know metre/consonance/assonance/etc is a thing in english writing too but the musicality of some poems is so keenly intrinsic and deeply woven in—so many ghazals are sung &amp; it's the most beautiful thing. that is to say—i get you. lyrics are cool as hell. <br>i listened to untitled by eden but it was late afternoon and ur right—it rlly is a 3am song. im listening 2 it again rn at night &amp; gosh—im Feeling Things. i love the addition of like. less traditional music stuff? idk how to articulate it but the way charlie burg's stuff sometimes has people speaking &amp; voices fading in and out—i love that. there's a little bit of that in this and it just makes it a peculiarly resonant and layered song to listen to. it's so atmospheric—&amp; the lyrics are SO cool. <br>its an entire acrobatics show tryna fit this into the char count (i didn't even talk abt the flls update 😭) so yes! if u have time, listen to i just wanna be loved by JORDY/false art by lizzy mcalpine &amp; ben kessler—they've been persistently loud in my head tonight, enough that i almost can't read. i hope you have a lovely day &amp; week &amp; this was such a lovely thing to open MY week to &lt;33🌤 - 🧚‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>deal deal deal let us go wild (within the confines of the character limits) 🤝 oh gosh that is so heartwarming :( i always read these ccs twice when i get them, then again and again as i reply; each word just feels so precious, and i’m always worried i’ll miss a couple of lines and how awful would that be? though i definitely have done that ☹️<br><br>hearing you describe your crush made me so fluttery too oh goodness… having a sweet crush does sound fun, and i don’t think it’s ~dumb at all to be cliche &amp; young. liking someone isn’t often so reliant on what’s sweet and hilarious and i think there’s a lot to be treasured in this, so i’m super delighted and secondhand moved that there is that element of literal connection now that you can send her something 💌<br><br>speaking of which: letters !! i always make a point to write a long card/letter for friends once on their bday and once during the holidays, however they celebrate, and my fav part of the end of the year is definitely the little knick knacks to add 🥺 especially like. going through the months and seeing something and knowing i can save it for when i can give the card. but yesssss playlists and polaroids are wonderfullllll just the thought alone makes me 🍃🌈💫🌱🦋☁️ and doodles on the letters oh my god oh my god this is so exciting i am so thrilled for you<br><br>if you ever have the opportunity to take weird media-related classes in college, i highly recommend it! i’m lucky to have double majored in two subjects i liked, but it’s the little oddly specific electives that really made my semesters before more worth it than the money i threw at it 😐 and funny you bring up words &amp; sound bc i work in audio storytelling rn and have to do a lot of production with spoke word/poetry. and even more interesting that you brought up urdu bc i just recorded with a pakistani-canadian poet yesterday and the musicality in this one part of the poem where she starts half-singing to her mother was just so so stunning. and i think in general, poetry just feels so beautiful to me bc it is so untouchable; like i could never conceive of myself as a poet, have deliberately even tried so many other forms of writing Except poetry, and i think maybe part of that is precisely bc it feels as much music (which is a new friend i’m learning to get to know) as it does words (which i’ve had an established dynamic with all my life). i don’t know. poetry (and by extension, songwriting) would be very cool to get into — and definitely not just in english, which i think can be a little too kind to me than if i was working in translation or just straight up in another language.<br><br>anyway sorry went on a tangent there i am running out of space and will talk more about voices in music next time !! until then, both jordy and ofc lizzy were excellent (and also, was there a reason they were in your head the other night?) and i wish you the loveliest day and week, as ever 🤍🤍</div>

I LOVE CHARLIE BURG i was listening to him while doing my art coursework &amp; i had to stop a couple times to headbop JFHJG i love his more experimental stuff? the mishmash of vocals is so enrapturing - it's interesting in a way that makes you sit up and grin bc holy shit that's cooool. and omg boy in space's live album slaps? it’s so weird it doesn't even sound live but i can kinda tell bc it feels a little more unleashed and it’s so COOL (give me at night with earphones was an Experience).<br><br>i've been listening to a lot of avery lynch lately, &amp; ROSIE, &amp; emily burns (so many white girl breakup songs 😭 it's okay they're good 😭😭). ella jane is cool too. the city slaps. so does hiccup (acoustic) by valley. shoffy reminds me a of charlie burg but w a lil less lofi vibes? and the happy fits is a cool band! she wants me to be loved is SUCH a banger. <br><br>also! yes!! i did discover smth new &amp; lovely today and it made me so happy i felt like crying. i've live somewhere far enough from the west that it means a ton of my friends are completely online - i'm lucky as hell to have them but it's so :( knowing our irl interactions will be limited at best. they were discussing sending letters &amp; i was like i wanna do that so bad it's ridiculous (love letters, you know?) but mail is flighty &amp; i didnt know if it'd reach here/vice versa? but today my dad’s old high school roommate sent him some tea (it was so sweet) &amp; i asked him 😳 wait. post gets here? it doesn't get lost, could i send people letters? &amp; he's like yeah? and i DIE inside. i've wanted this for so long. i'm gonna send one to my crush for her birthday maybe 😤😳, &amp; to friends. i love them!! i love this! i'll write to my sister too. i'm so happy. i hope something made you happy today! or that you were reminded of something Good (the capital g is important), or something that you love(d), or something so familiar it made your heart sing. thank u for sharing ur lovely thoughts &amp; music! and for reading to the end of this veritable essay i'm terrible at cutting stuff down 😭 tell me about the 2014 radio show? it sounds exciting! ☁️🌥🌤☀️♥️ - 🧚🏽‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>that is totally my line !! thank you for being so diligent &amp; kind &amp; lovely with your cc messages and song recs; it’s always such a highlight of my day when i get one from you so i just wanna start by saying that you never have to apologize for any of the messages being long oh my god ❤️ and yes !! there was a point where i was steadfastly like, “i want to write stories that feel like some of my favourite sleeping at last songs do.” and to a degree i still think the same way? and i think part of that is the nostalgia that just feels so inherent to their songs and that you kinda touch on here with hearing their version of a song you remember from childhood. <br><br>i think the point i started really thinking about lyrics is after taking a broadway class and like — i’ve always liked musical theatre, in whatever form, but there’s so much narrative weight and poetry in how lyricists approach these songs and whenever i notice similar sentiments or choices in the lyrics of the music i listen to, it’s really hard not to fall for a song. and ahhh charlie burg embodies quiet heartbreak to me for i think mostly subjective reasons sjhdsjs but yes sometimes i get into moods where i only wanna listen to him so i’m super glad he got a few headbops from you 🥺🥺 and “makes you sit up and grin” made Me grin bc that’s such a cool way of describing the reactions and emotions he prompts !! and oh my godddd boy in space is the whitest of of the white music i listen to (so i don’t blame you for the white girl breakup songs and will get right back to you when i listen to the ones you listed here) but sometimes he just Hits the way i need him to ?? and like a friend introduced me to untitled by EDEN at like 3am and it’s the same deal with that one. listen to it in the right moment and i feel transcendent.<br><br>ALSO OH MY GOSH. THAT IS SO WONDERFUL I LOVE SENDING AND RECEIVING LETTERS I THINK THERE’S A VERY PARTICULAR KIND OF CONNECTION AND LOVE IN THEM I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU. SENDING ONE TO YOUR CRUSH (AND TO YOUR FRIENDS &amp; SISTER, TOO, OF COURSE) SOUNDS LIKE THE SWEETEST THING TO BE ABLE TO DO. okay sorry omg why am i in all caps ?? i got too excited ?? thank you for sharing, i am smiling so much ❤️<br><br>today was a slow day for me, so nothing new really, but that 2014 radio show is just this old two-hour show that a dj records from her bedroom in montreal and i haven’t had the chance to fully check it out but i know i can expect intimate conversations and soft music so i am very very excited !! <br><br>again, as ever, as always, send me an essay any time, whatever about. i truly, truly appreciate you taking the time to send these things to lil’ ol’ me. i wish you the kindest of weeks as we enter a new one &amp; best of luck with your epistolary endeavours !! if you feel comfortable, tell me more? i love letter-sending so much :(</div>

 <div class=question>Not the original question asker, but I’ve been thinking a lot about your answer abt what your fav part of h&amp;w was, and I just sympathize soooooo much. Yuuta and Megumi’s conversation was so short, and succinct but carried SO much weight to it. The entire fic moved me to tears, but It was the last line of that scene that made the bile rise in my throat. It was so brief but carried SO much weight and it really did act as a backbone for the rest of the tension in the story. I agree that it wouldnt be the same without that scene. Again, Not really a question, I just wanted to gush about your writing again!</div>

 <div class=reply>thank you so, so much for this, and it is absolutely okay that it isn’t a question !! i’m super touched by everything you validated here for me — and especially to hear that the fic moved you, that this scene played a hand in that. this convo is far from the most ~emotional scene in h&amp;w imo but it’s the most loaded one nevertheless, and i think it was this scene that finally gave the fic direction towards an ending for me. why it took more than 10k, i will never know, but i do know that had the ending been different, had the ending been a traditionally happier one, i would have taken this scene out. which i believe says a lot about what it does. so. huh. food for thought for me for future writing. but that’s just me talking to myself oops<br><br>i really, really appreciate your thoughtfulness, in more ways than one here in this message, so thank you again and i wish you a lovely weekend 🤍</div>

 <div class=reply>oooohh i can answer both questions !!<br><br>① isbn database and legally speaking, i do have a published original work that i wrote around the same time i was writing for bnha — but i should note that it’s one that is back in my hands after going through many godforsaken steps in the traditional publishing world (that i don’t mind getting into, but that much context is not required here so i am breezing past in the name of word limit.) the manuscript is a PDF file somewhere in my drive now, thank god, it’s like the novel equivalent of the embarrassing middle school years for me as far as where my writing is now and ahhhhh <br><br>② re: books: i am hesitant to rec anything without more criteria, so i’ll answer from a personal favs perspective, if that’s okay !! <br><br>these are just off the top of my head, but here are two from the past handful of years that changed, if not me or my life, my approach to storytelling:<br><br>✧ less by andrew sean greer <br><br>polarizing in the sense that all recent pulitzer winners are, but this novel makes me feel a type of way i’ve been trying to chase in other books since. this is extremely, extremely character-centric from my perspective, yet not from that the viewpoint of its main character, and though there are plenty of moments where you question where the story is going, the answer, really, is ~nowhere, and i appreciate it for that. i do think it’s not for everyone, and i salute the people who outright hate it (also there are a few possinly sketchy relationships) but personally speaking, the introspection is the heart of the story, really everything it is to me, and in that is a literal lifetime’s worth of thinking and reflecting with sometimes heartbreaking and funny-unfunny country-hopping in the mix <br><br>✧ the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne<br><br>my all-time fav novel isn’t all-time in that it changes every few years: it used to be the kite runner, which is the novel that made me want to write-write, but these past few years, that designation has gone to the heart’s invisible furies by john boyne. not a novel without flaws, and a very, very long one at that, but it’s a novel near and dear to my heart and representative of the one i want to write in the far, far someday. the exact opposite of the book above: long, over many, many years from birth until death, but equally introspective and wistful and heartbreaking and at times funny and ridiculous. i love it so very much. <br><br>also, at this stage of my life, i’m really fond of creative memoir types, and i want to give these two a shoutout for encapsulating the kind of stories i want to be able to tell:<br><br>✧ why fish don’t exist by lulu miller<br>✧ birds art life by kyo maclear</div>

 <div class=question>i live literally across the world from america so i woke up to this reply (it happened yesterday too!! hella nice to see first thing in the morning) and just :))) HELL yea @ everything you said n it's so cool and surreal hearing you as an author talk abt ur work &amp; creations. also! i'm so so SO happy you like luz!! istg like - the first week after discovering her music, i literally went through her entire youtube &amp; half of her insta to hear more of her singing :sob: her collab w noah kahan on passenger (its on youtube) is kinda gorgeous, tbh. i'm always a sucker for amazingly done harmony i literally like astral project whenever i hear it HDJFH. have you heard reasons not to die by ryn weaver? it's not the kind of soft luz and lizzy mcalpine can be but its one of my favourites - it's just so fullllll and filled with haunting, lovely familiarity. also it may not be as much of a favourite as this ^ but i rly adore the cover of rainbow connection that sleeping at last did. it's just so!!! nostalgic; i could slow dance to it. and i love maisie peters too omg her music SLAPS - listen to maybe uhhh,, take care of yourself, or favourite ex, or stay young - i like her entire discography tbh. ill be there by sody is super cute too :pleading_face::pleading_face: . aargh i love music sm i think sharing it with people is a particular kind of love language. do you focus on lyrics more or the whole sound of a song?<br><br>anyways im rambling but! stay well, i hope ur day goes smoothly (i'm still so so happy u liked the author btw, it's one of my favourites). i hope you get to discover something new and lovely today!! :) -🧚🏽‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>it was completely your thoughts that prompted all of that so thank you !! and god, getting into luz has been so heartrending; i’m at that consumption phase rn myself, so thanks for bringing up her insta bc i’m running out and that’s next !! i had to listen to the noah kahan original first bc i confess i haven’t heard this song before — and ohhhh going from a few listens of that straight to the collab was transcendent with headphones on. and as for ryn weaver, haunting but familiar is a really good way to put it. when the two-minute mark hit. wow. but then it slows back down… and ouch ????<br><br>yes for sure for sure i had a huge maisie peters phase back in 2017 but ahhhhh i admit i haven’t delved into her recent music. stay young is playing as i type this, and gosh, i missed her lovely voice so much. and sleeping at last is IT for me; i think his music is the one i consistently listen to no matter where my taste shifts towards. the definition of tender tbh his music owns a corner of my heart forever. and slow dancing to his rainbow connection is a strangely heartbreaking description ahhhh<br><br>on to sody: i went through the entire album that i’ll be there is part of and they’re such an interesting lyricist? never the subject and the take i expect, and combined with their voice it feels so… intimate isn’t the word i’m looking for bc there’s still a distance there, but it’s the equivalent of attending a slam poetry night and the next act has everyone in the coffee shop exchanging alarmed looks. except soft. so soft.<br><br>that said, i’m a little bit of both lyrics and sound !! most of my attachment to songs comes adjacent to my attachment to a thing i associate the song with, so lyrics definitely play a part in that connection. but usually i’m a sucker for soft vocals, however that might be and whatever they might be singing about, and also any song that has that one distinct part that makes me feel like yanking my heart out. which — lately — i’ve been going to artists like lizzy mcalpine and charlie burg and gracie abrams and boy in space’s live album for. what about you? 😊<br><br>and p l e a s e you can ramble to me any time !! whether about music — which you have such a lovely, interesting ear for — or whatever else. thank you for sharing your music with me; i’m surrounded by musicians who don’t often share what i look for (even though my taste itself is nonexistent and i’ll listen to Anything once given an opportunity for emotional attachment) so this has been so, so appreciated. i hope the rest of your day goes smoothly as well ❤️<br><br>p.s. oh my god “i hope you get to discover something new and lovely today” is so :( thank you so much :( what a sweet thing to say :( i discovered a few recordings of a two-hour radio show from 2014 so that has been exciting. thank you for this, thank you for you, and i hope you also discovered something new and lovely today.</div>

 <div class=question>hello!! it's the anon who left the looong comment before w the sunglasses qs at the end lol - first of all, ur answer made me smile sm!! it was so nice hearing your thoughts on MY thoughts and tbh that one anon who told u ur general conversational style is lovely is so right; it rly is nice when you ramble 😤😤!! second - i was thinking abt ur memory loss fic a little more and just imagining the diverging dynamics of the characters in the reality that WOULD'VE taken place right as the fic ends, you know - like megumi's going abroad, nobara's going to be much more solitary &amp; alone in japan, and itadori is. well. umm. vibing hard. but yea, i just think that element of divergence and journey and that heartworn dichotomy of leaving/moving forward but being sure to come back (because megumi actually can come back - he has the option to, unlike itadori) is a rly nice implication to end the fic on. it's thoroughly not stagnant. i hesistate to label the feeling as bittersweet bc it just seems so much more overwhelming and intense than that, both in how tender and in how heartwrenching it is. nobara's side of things is also something i'm super curious about, because, well, she's a curious character!! and she's gonna be alone - or, at least on her own in a place where she never was before, and that's pretty interesting to think abt. third - this is already getting long lol so i'll leave rambling for another time, but i absolutely ADORE flls. it literally makes my heart feel all warm and fuzzy - if i had a physical copy i would kiss it when my fondness overflows. fourth - i would literally die for lizzy mcalpine, i love her songs sooo much wtf. have you heard ummm the author, by luz? the vibes aren't too similar, but it's a sweet song nonetheless!! anyways i hope you had/are having/will have a lovely day !! - 🧚🏽‍♀️</div>

 <div class=reply>hello again !! how do u keep sending the loveliest things !! i’ll start full on tearing up for real at this rate !! i don’t wanna go over the character limit again so now i feel like an oscar winner trying to keep to the time limit for a speech but first off: thank you for your kind words abt my ramblings, your thoughts on h&amp;w (the fact that you were Thinking abt it? i’m so moved i don’t know what to do with myself), your thoughts abt my thoughts abt your thoughts, and for the beautiful song rec that i’ll get to in a sec. <br><br>that said, it’s very, very interesting of you to point out that nobara’s never been alone in tokyo/jjt before. i also agree with the triple dynamic between leaving/moving forward/coming back, which are all distinct things that none of the three can fully do bc the central figure of these themes — yuuji — hasn’t left completely, either. but to focus on nobara, bc i have such tenderness for the version of her in h&amp;w: i like that it’s her who stays in the end, the only “here” in “here and where you are” (ha-ha) and it’s her whom megumi believes still has a chance to be yuuji’s friend if she so wants. nobara who left her countryside town to pursue more, to wrench herself out of stasis — and now she’s the one, technically, that the other two can come back to right where they were. i’m so so curious about her canon perspective on yuuji &amp; megumi and all the tender, messed up loyalties &amp; care they have for each other, but in the context of h&amp;w (and one that’s not really seen bc it’s written in megumi’s perspective) my heartbreak is in how much it must have hurt for her as well, not only to grieve the non-loss of a friend, but to see the one friend she has left by her side grieve all the things he does. she hurts in her own way abt yuuji, but she also hurts for the way that megumi hurts abt yuuji. and there’s nothing tangible for her to do abt either. it’s not something she can move out of by leaving. it’s not something she’ll ever wanna move forward from. there’s nothing for her to come back to. nothing to pursue like she did saori. she’s back to stasis, yet i agree that it’s somehow not stagnant, if only bc it’s nobara. but that contradiction is a far, far more difficult thing, i think, than any other version of the grief she could have had. <br><br>thirdly: lizzy mcalpine! i knoooow! i only discovered her recently from the snippet of reckless driving but i am in love. also! this rec! sweet song, you say! i was not prepared for how DEVASTATING i would find it. THE SECOND CHORUS. I WAS NOT OKAY WITH THE PIANO CHANGE. luz’s voice is so sweet yet longing, i’ve been listening to nothing but this song all of yesterday and today, god. i started checking out their other songs, too, and now one of them is in the flls playlist and i can’t wait to devour more of their stuff. thank you for this rec, truly. <br><br>i also hope you had/are having/will have a lovely day ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>hi !! thank you so so so so so so much !! this means a lot, particularly over a fic i love as much as first love, late spring, so thank you to the moon and back ❤️ <br><br>and yes, i do read fics on ao3! only that all my all-time favourite fics on ao3 are in fandoms i haven’t been part of or will likely never read more from save for the one fic. i don’t often read fics in the fandoms i am writing for; sometimes i read before i know i want to write for it, or sometimes i read after, but never or rarely during. i think i’m always afraid of losing touch with the characterization that feels true to me, or i start thinking of a fic from a writer-ly (ugh, i’m sorry for using this term, i feel gross too) perspective and can’t seem to get fully swept away in it — which is silly and ridiculous, i know, and should not stop me from consuming content bc i know for a fact there are many, many wonderful fics out there in the tags i wrote for and that i have much, much, much to learn from them. that’s something for me to work on once the initial fever of writing for jjk dies down, mayhaps.<br><br>but anyway. it’s a very exciting and novel thing, always very special for me, when i find a longfic i really like and just devour it. it’s like reading a traditionally published book and getting to know characters that i myself don’t know well. so. all in all, yes, i read on ao3 and have a bunch of fics i hold near and dear to my heart and my own approach to storytelling 😊<br><br>now, to get to the highlight of your cc — oh my god, are you kidding, i would love a jjk actors au. i just answered another cc with what my favourite aus are and i definitely underestimated how much i love actor aus. oh my god. good, good, good stuff. but i’ll post a screenshot of that part in reply to the tweet for this answer bc i think this is getting too long yet again sjsjsks</div>

 <div class=reply>strangely enough, i have very few favorites? i know i’ve written fake dating twice now but it’s never actually been bc i loved it and hungered for it or anything like that. i think i like it bc it’s so universally beloved and that’s contagious when writing, but me including it was situational, more plot &gt; trope, in flls. i think i just am not the biggest on fics that are trope alone instead of trope in service of characters, so it’s difficult to think of it in terms of which ones i love and will consume indiscriminately — god, where the hell am i going with this.<br><br>sorry. let me start over. i like slice of life in anything, in whatever form. does that count as an answer to the au question? any au where you can strip down a canon character to who they are in a modern setting is. yes. i am very, very down for that. so by extension, then, i guess i also love college aus — and oh !! i love aus with very specific environments. mostly non-fantastical just-a-touch-removed-from-slice-of-life ones — entertainment industry, art world, pro athlete / olympians — but i can also be easily persuaded by a light urban fantasy or magical realism au. <br><br>as for ✨ tropes ✨ i really really like tense dynamic based ones. exes is a particular favourite. fwb is another. fake marriage is more compelling to me than fake dating. any relationship with a Past™ is a yes. enemy-adjacent (not enemies, more “we should hate each other bc our friends hate each other) to lovers is also good, though i’ve only seen it like once. <br><br>OH AND SECRET RELATIONSHIPS WHY HAVEN’T I EVER WRITTEN THAT <br><br>also i realized only after writing h&amp;w that i do love a good "person a is supposed to k*ll person b" narrative, no matter how it ends. <br><br>and a h h h h wait how can i forget — royalty. royalty aus are IT for me. especially modern royalty. no, the monarchy should not be romanticized and yes i do feel weird about the concept of media like the crown (2016—) but when i say modern royal aus own me? heart, body and soul? i mean that with Every Ounce of truth.<br><br>so there you go. i sincerely, sincerely apologize for this stream of consciousness-ish answer. i promise i mean everything i wrote here. <br><br>i hope you have a nice day as well, thank you so much ✨🌈☁️🍄🌼🦋🧚🏼‍♂️🌷</div>

 <div class=question>gosh i just. i don't even know how long i've been following you for, honestly, but it's kind of funny bc most of the fandoms ive stumbled into have a fic written by you for them. like - ur bnha stuff, ur vld fic? and i just finished jjk a day ago and immediately went and searched it in my inbox to see if anyone i've subscribed to had posted, and dude. holy shit. like ur two jjk fics were the only ones i found and i just read both and had to take a literal break after both and stare into space bc holy fucking shit. theyre both - i don't even wanna say good bc i was in a state of 'man. this isnt just good, it's fucking gorgeous' throughout. ur writing style is honestly such an inspiration and i genuinely wanna take notes on it JSHSJ idk there's a lot of thought and care gone into ur work and it really shows - and a lot of emotion too, and that doesn't just show, it makes me cry too 😭 im broken!! halfway thru the latest jjk one i was like yo wait this isn't gonna have like a quote unquote happy ending is it,, and don't get me wrong a part of me kinda was wailing inside bc poor babies 🥺 but also it was a rlly cool narrative choice and imo worked out rlly fucking well. like SUPER well like by the end i was like . ofc i wouldve loved a happy ending bc everything u write is super cool BUT idk that would've maybe reduced what this fic is n how this fic played out or at least made it much much longer. but yeah. i really really love how it isn't really about megumi's current relationship with yuuji but rather his grief alongside nobara's. idk. its amazingly done and like,, thank u for writing ♥️ this is SO long and not even a question i feel so bad 😭 so uhhh obligatory question!! do you have any inspirations? do you like/write original work? if yuuji bought megumi sparkly sunglasses as a gag gift do u think he actually wear them.</div>

 <div class=reply>okay okay okay first off, without getting into why i was getting up so late, i want to thank you for sending this message when you did because that meant that it was the absolute first notification i saw when i came awake — and there’s nothing at all like starting your day with something this long and lovely and earnest. so. thank you so, so much. <br><br>i copy-pasted this message on a google doc bc a) i might be a little too extra for an earth sign but b) i also was just. really touched. and i wanted to make sure i addressed every single part of the comment that made me smile so wide. so i went and highlighted everything and i will now attempt to articulate my thoughts and emotions about each one. again, got too long for cc so i will be attaching screenshots to the tweet ❤️</div>

 <div class=reply>no worries at all !! i hope i interpreted this correctly though. let's see. dream fic as in dream fic to read? or dream fic to write? because i have a lot of fics i hold very close to heart and do think of as my dream fics, even though none of them are for fandoms i've ever actually been in. as for dream fic to write — i fantasize every day about writing something short again. short like the yoi episode 11 fics, but with the emotional and character weight that i want to say the ep 9 fic has, for example. ideally a gen one at that. right now, i'm eyeing a quick nanami &amp; yuuji thing — but i don't think i'm strong enough for that yet, honestly. i don't know. writing long fics sometimes feels like the equivalent of hearing myself talk and talk and talk and that's just — it doesn't feel very good, being sick of my own words. so i'd really like to write a short thing this year. that would be my dream fic right now. something more disjointed? or something less heavy, not in terms of subject material but the literal words itself. something that gets to breathe more?<br><br>but sorry, i'm going on a tangent here. i apologize if you were shooting for a completely different answer :| if you want to send a follow-up question, i promise i'll be happy to answer and it won't be weird at all !!</div>

 <div class=question>Your BNHA fics were so lovely the first, second and third time around. I'm still reading them!! 2 A.M. is my favorite and I don't think I'll ever stop recommending them. Your YOI fics were also so- SO WONDERFUL!! lie to make me like you was also very enjoyable and I can't stop rereading the ending to it, because you wrapped it up so beautifully!! Honestly, I've read all your fics and am so overjoyed at having to participate in this shift of fandoms as well. You inspire me to start writing myself and I appreciate that so so so much and many other things I can't vocalize yet. Thank you!! ^^</div>
